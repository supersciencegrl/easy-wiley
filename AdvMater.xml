         <title>Stepwise Energy Transfer: Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence from Doped Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic near infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence systems with bright and long&#8208;lived emission are highly valuable for applications in communication, imaging and sensors. However, realizing these materials (especially lifetime over 0.1 s) is a challenge, mainly because of non&#8208;radiative quenching of their long&#8208;lived excitons. Herein, a universal strategy of stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for bright NIR system with remarkable persistent luminescence (up to 0.2 s at 810&#160;nm) is presented, based on a new triphenylene dye doped polymer (TP@PVA) with persistent blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s. This persistent NIR luminescence is demonstrated for application of not only NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting but also NIR bioimaging of penetrating a piece of skin as thick as 2.0&#160;mm. By co&#8208;doping a red dye (such as Nile red) and a NIR dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) into this doped PVA film, the shortage of spectral overlap between TP emission and Cy7 absorbance is successfully solved, through a stepwise FRET process involving of triplet to singlet (TS)&#8208;FRET from TP to the intermediate red dye and then singlet to singlet (SS)&#8208;FRET to Cy7. It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS&#8208;FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS&#8208;FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.

By co-doping a red dye (such as Nile red) and a NIR dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) into this doped PVA film, the shortage of spectral overlap between TP emission and Cy7 absorbance is successfully solved, through a stepwise FRET process involving of triplet to singlet (TS)-FRET from TP to the intermediate red dye and then singlet to singlet (SS)-FRET to Cy7. It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS-FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS-FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Harnessing Plasma&#8208;Assisted Doping Engineering to Stabilize Metallic Phase MoSe2 for Fast and Durable Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metallic phase MoSe2 (1T&#8208;MoSe2) has aroused as a rising star for sodium storage in comparison with its semiconductor phase (2H&#8208;MoSe2) owing to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity and unimpeded Na+ diffusion structure. However, the thermodynamically unstable nature of 1T phase renders it an unprecedented challenge to realize its phase control and stabilization. Herein, for the first time, a plasma&#8208;assisted P doping triggered phase transition engineering is proposed to synthesis stabilized P&#8208;doped 1T&#8208;MoSe2 nanoflowers composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs). Mechanism analysis reveals significantly decreased phase transition energy barriers of the plasma&#8208;induced Se vacancy&#8208;rich MoSe2 from 2H to 1T owing to its low crystallinity and reduced structure stability. The vacancy&#8208;rich structure arouses high concentrate P doping, which manipulates the electronic structure of MoSe2 and urges its phase transition, acquiring a high transition efficiency of 91% accompanied with ultra&#8208;high phase stability. As a result, the P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs delivers an exceptional high reversible capacity of 510.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with no capacity fading over 1000 cycles at 5000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for sodium storage. The underlying mechanism of this phase transition engineering verified by profound analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>Folding and Fracture of Single Crystal Graphene Grown on a Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A single crystal graphene film grown on a Cu(111) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has ribbon&#8208;like fold structures. These graphene folds are highly&#8208;oriented and essentially parallel to each other. Cu surface steps underneath graphene are along the &lt;110&gt;&#160;and &lt;211&gt;&#160;directions, leading to the formation of the arrays of folds. The folds in the single layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into &#8220;alternating&#8221; patterns. A &#8220;joint&#8221; (an AB&#8208;stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few&#8208;layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD&#8208;grown single crystal SLG film was simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD&#8208;grown single crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.

         <title>3D Hierarchical Host with Enhanced Sodiophilicity Enabling Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been considered as a compliment to lithium metal batteries for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium (Na). Herein, a 3D nanostructured porous carbon particle containing carbon shell&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (PC&#8208;CFe) is employed as a highly reversible Na metal host. PC&#8208;CFe has a unique 3D hierarchy based on submicron&#8208;sized carbon particles, ordered open channels within the carbon particles, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles on the surface. PC&#8208;CFe achieves high reversibility of Na plating/stripping processes over 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8211;2 in Na//Cu asymmetric cells, as well as over 14400 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in Na//Na symmetric cells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior cycling performance of PC&#8208;CFe stems from the stronger adsorption of Na on the surface of the carbon&#8208;coated Fe NPs, which can provide initial nucleation sites more favorable to Na deposition. Moreover, the full cell with a PC&#8208;CFe host without Na metal and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) maintains a high capacity of 103 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 even after 100 cycles, demonstrating the operation of anode&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Engineering macrophage exosome disguised biodegradable nanoplatform for enhanced sonodynamic therapy of glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) exhibits high tissue penetration and negligible radiation damage to normal tissues, and thus emerges as a promising cancer therapeutic modality for glioblastoma (GBM). However, the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and hypoxic microenvironment greatly limit the SDT efficiency. In this work, a biodegradable nanoplatform (termed as CSI) was fabricated by encapsulating catalase (CAT) into silica nanoparticles (CAT@SiO2) for tumor hypoxia relief, and then loaded with the sonosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG). Inspired by the ability of macrophages to cross the BBB, CSI was further coated with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified macrophage exosomes to form CSI@Ex&#8208;A, which possessed efficient BBB penetration and good cancer cell&#8208;targeting capability. After tumor cell endocytosis, highly expressed glutathione (GSH) triggeres biodegradation of the nanoplatform and the released CAT catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. The GSH depletion and O2 self&#8208;supplying effectively enhanced the SDT efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the resulting CSI@Ex&#8208;A exhibited good biocompatibility and long circulation time. These findings demonstrate that CSI@Ex&#8208;A may serve as a competent nanoplatform for GBM therapy, with potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Photosensitizer Nanodot Eliciting Immunogenicity for Photo&#8208;Immunologic Therapy of Postoperative Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infection and Secondary Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By eliciting infection&#8208;related immunogenicity to achieve a higher level of active immunologic responses during acute phase infection and long&#8208;term immunosurveillance, AgB nanodots under near&#8208;infrared irradiation can demonstrate excellent antibacterial results through photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ions. This strategy could solve the predicament remaining in postoperative methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related infection and prevent recurrence.








Abstract
The treatment of postoperative infection caused by multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has become an intractable clinical challenge owing to its low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence. Apart from imperfect antibacterial therapies, induction of insufficient immunogenicity, required for the successful clearance of a pathogen, may also contribute to the problem. Herein, an ultra&#8208;micro photosensitizer, AgB nanodots, using photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ion sterilization, are utilized to efficiently clear invading MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. AgB nanodots are also found to upregulate host immunogenicity in a murine model and establish immunological memory by promoting the upregulated expression of danger signals that are commonly induced by stress&#8208;related responses, including sudden temperature spikes or excess reactive oxygen production. These stimulations boost the antibacterial effects of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, or even memory B cells, which is usually defined as infection&#8208;related immunogenic cell death. Hence, the proposed AgB nanodot strategy may offer a novel platform for the effective treatment of postoperative infection while providing a systematic immunotherapeutic strategy to combat persistent infections, thereby markedly reducing the incidence of recurrence following recovery from primary infections.

         <title>Fluorination&#8208;Enhanced Surface Stability of Disordered Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of Mn&#8208;based cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathodes with increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Fx, x&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) is revealed. Associated with the reduced O redox activity, F in the DRX mitigates the formation of an O&#8208;deficient surface upon cycling, therefore leading to increased stability of the DRX cathode.








Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxides are a promising new class of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their capacity fade presents a major challenge. Partial fluorine (F) substitution into the oxygen (O) lattice appears to be an effective strategy for improving the cycling stability, but the underlying atomistic mechanism remains elusive. Here, using a combination of advanced transmission electron microscopy based imaging and spectroscopy techniques, the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of Mn&#8208;based DRX cathodes with an increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Fx, x&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) are probed. The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of the DRX is revealed. It is discovered that, due to the reduced O redox activity while with increasing F concentration, F in the DRX lattice mitigates the formation of an O&#8208;deficient surface layer upon cycling. For low F&#8208;substituted DRX, the O loss near the surface results in the formation of an amorphous cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer and nanoscale voids after extended cycling. Increased F concentration in the DRX lattice minimizes both O loss and the interfacial reactions between DRX and the liquid electrolyte, enhancing the surface stability of DRX. These results provide guidance on the development of next&#8208;generation cathode materials through anion substitution.

         <title>All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Van der Waals Heterostructures for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D van der Waals nanosheets from molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted electrochemical exfoliation are assembled to form building blocks for wafer&#8208;scale electronics. By using graphene, MoS2 and single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube, and oxidized HfS2 as metallic, n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type semiconducting, and insulating building blocks, various devices are realized including field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, p&#8211;n diodes, and complementary logic gates.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) materials have been considered as potential building blocks for use in fundamental elements of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as electrodes, channels, and dielectrics, because of their diverse and remarkable electrical properties. Furthermore, two or more building blocks of different electronic types can be stacked vertically to generate vdW heterostructures with desired electrical behaviors. However, such fundamental approaches cannot directly be applied practically because of issues such as precise alignment/positioning and large&#8208;quantity material production. Here, these limitations are overcome and wafer&#8208;scale vdW heterostructures are demonstrated by exploiting the lateral and vertical assembly of solution&#8208;processed 2D vdW materials. The high exfoliation yield of the molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted approach enables the production of micrometer&#8208;sized nanosheets in large quantities and its lateral assembly in a wafer&#8208;scale via vdW interactions. Subsequently, the laterally assembled vdW thin&#8208;films are vertically assembled to demonstrate various electronic device applications, such as transistors and photodetectors. Furthermore, multidimensional vdW heterostructures are demonstrated by integrating 1D carbon nanotubes as a p&#8208;type semiconductor to fabricate p&#8211;n diodes and complementary logic gates. Finally, electronic devices are fabricated via inkjet printing as a lithography&#8208;free manner based on the stable nanomaterial dispersions.

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based 2D Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulk conductivity of naphthalene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n&#8208;doping with cobaltocene. Following single&#8208;electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping&#8208;mechanism.








Abstract
2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, the controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

         <title>Topological Antiferromagnetic van der Waals Phase in Topological Insulator/Ferromagnet Heterostructures Synthesized by CMOS&#8208;Compatible Sputtering Technique</title>

Abstract
Breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry by introducing magnetic order and thereby opening a gap in the topological surface state bands is essential for realizing useful topological properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. In this work, a novel topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is created at the interface of a sputtered, c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented, topological insulator/ferromagnet (TI/FM) heterostructure &#8211; Bi2Te3/Ni80Fe20 because of diffusion of Ni in Bi2Te3 (Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3). The AFM property of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interfacial layer was established by observation of spontaneous exchange bias in the magnetic hysteresis loop and compensated moments in the depth profile of magnetization using polarized neutron reflectometry. Analysis of structural and chemical properties of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer was carried out using selected area electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies, in parallel with our first&#8208;principles calculations, indicate a solid&#8208;state chemical reaction that leads to the formation of Ni&#8208;Te bonds and the presence of topological AFM compound NiBi2Te4 in the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interface layer. The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is &#8764;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway towards industrial CMOS&#8208;process&#8208;compatible sputtered&#8208;MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.

         <title>A Library of ROS&#8208;Catalytic Metalloenzyme&#8208;Mimics with Atomic Metal Centers</title>

Abstract
Accompanied by the development of nanomaterial science, the metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated centers supported by carbonaceous substrates have emerged as promising artificial metalloenzymes (AMEs) to mimic the biocatalytic effects of their natural counterparts. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined AMEs that contain different atomic metal&#8208;N centers but present similar physicochemical and coordination structures remains a substantial challenge. Here, we have synthesized 20 different types of AMEs with similar geometry and well&#8208;defined atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated centers to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectvities, kinetics, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products. We systematically explored their oxidase&#8208;(OXD), peroxidase&#8208;(POD), and halogen peroxidase&#8208;mimetic (HPO) catalytic behaviors. The Fe&#8208;AME shows the highest OXD&#8208; and HPO&#8208;mimetic activities compared to the other AMEs due to its high vmax (0.927&#160;&#956;M s&#8722;1) and low Km (1.070&#160;mM), while the Cu&#8208;AME displays the best POD&#8208;like performance. Furthermore, theoretical calculation reveals that the ROS&#8208;catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of metal centers. Benefiting from its facile adsorption of H2O2 molecule and lower energy barrier to generating &#8226;O2&#8722;, the Fe&#8208;AME displays higher ROS&#8208;catalytic performances than the Mn&#8208;AME. The engineered AMEs show not only remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also provide new guidance toward developing metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated biocatalysts for broad application fields.

         <title>Selenopeptide Nanomedicine Activates Natural Killer Cell for Enhanced Tumor Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy using the nanotechnology has shown great potential for cancer therapy in clinic. However, uncontrolled transportations and synergistic responses remain challenges. Here, we developed a self&#8208;assembled selenopeptide nanoparticle that strengthened the tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy through the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by the oxidative metabolite of the selenopeptide. With advantages of the enzyme&#8208;induced size&#8208;reduction and the reactive oxygen species&#8208;driven deselenization, this selenopeptide was able to deliver the therapeutics, e.g., doxorubicin (DOX) to solid tumors and further activate the NK cells in a programmed manner. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo results proved the mutual promotion between the DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy and the selenopeptide&#8208;induced immunotherapy, which synergistically contributed to the improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. It is anticipated that the selenopeptide may provide a type of promising stimuli&#8208;responsive immune modulator for versatile biomedical applications.

         <title>Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Contact Lens: Recent Advances and Future Opportunities in Diagnostics and Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The eye is one of the most complex organs in the human body, containing rich and critical physiological information (e.g., intraocular pressure, corneal temperature, and pH) as well as a library of metabolite biomarkers (e.g., glucose, proteins, and specific ions). Smart contact lenses (SCLs) can serve as a wearable intelligent ocular prosthetic device capable of non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of various essential physical/biochemical parameters and drug loading/delivery for the treatment of ocular diseases. Advances in SCL technologies and the growing public interest in personalized health are accelerating SCL research more than ever before. Here, we discussed the current status and potential of SCL development through a comprehensive review from fabrication to applications to commercialization. First, we discuss the material, fabrication, and platform designs of the SCLs for the diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Then, we review the latest advances in diagnostic and therapeutic SCLs for clinical translation. Later, we summarize the established techniques for wearable power transfer and wireless data transmission applied to current SCL devices. We also provide an outlook, future opportunities, and challenges for developing next&#8208;generation SCL devices. With the rise in interest of SCL development, this comprehensive and essential review can serve as a new paradigm for the SCL devices.

         <title>MXene&#8211;Based Metal Anode with Stepped Sodiophilic Gradient Structure Enables a Large Current Density for Rechargeable Na&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>

Abstract
The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium&#8208;metal batteries such as Na&#8208;O2 batteries. Designing 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode, however, the cycling stability at a large current density (&gt; 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8211;2) is still difficult to realize. In this work, we design a series of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h&#8208;Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG), and its thickness can be controlled (ranges from 80 to 250&#160;&#956;m). The sodiophilic of scaffold is adjusted by the content of h&#8208;Ti3C2, which is stepped increased from top (electrolyte membrane side) to bottom. The sodiophilic gradient structure can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom thus inhibits the growth of dendrite. The h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na based symmetrical batteries exhibited a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA&#8226;cm&#8211;2) and a high cut&#8208;off capacity (40 mAh&#8226;cm&#8211;2). Moreover, Na&#8211;O2 battery with h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137&#160;V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA&#8226;g&#8211;1 (is equivalent to 0.14 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2) and 1000 mAh&#8226;g&#8211;1 (0.14 mAh&#183;cm&#8211;2). This deposition&#8211;regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffold for high&#8208;performance sodium metal anode&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>White&#8208;Light Driven Resonant Emission from a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resonant emission in photonic structures is very useful to construct all&#8208;photonic circuits for optical interconnects and quantum computing. Optical generation of most resonant emitting modes in photonic structures has been obtained by coherent pumping rather than incoherent illumination. Particularly, the development of white&#8208;light or even solar&#8208;powered on&#8208;chip light sources remains challenging but is very attractive in view of the much facile availability of these incoherent excitation sources. Here the net resonant emission from monolayer semiconductor has been demonstrated under the simulated solar illumination by a white light&#8208;emitting diode. The device is formed by embedding a two&#8208;dimensional gain medium into a planar microcavity on a silicon wafer, which is compatible with the prevailing on&#8208;chip photonic technology. Coherent and white&#8208;light excitation sources are respectively selected for optical pumping, where the output light in two cases exhibits the well&#8208;consistent resonant wavelength, linewidth, polarization, location, and Gaussian&#8208;beam profile. The fundamental TEM00 mode behaves a doublet emission, resulting from anisotropy&#8208;induced nondegenerate states with orthogonal polarizations. The extraordinary spectral flipping is attributed to the competitive interplay of resonant absorption and emission. This work paves a way towards white&#8208;light or solar&#8208;powered state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photonic applications at the chip scale.

         <title>Hygroscopic chemistry enables fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is an extremely serious safety risk in energy storage devices; which can be avoided by replacing their components with nonflammable materials. However; these devices are still destroyed by the high&#8208;temperature decomposition; lacking reliability. Here; we further demonstrate a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor that recovers after the burn with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. Using fire&#8208;tolerant electrodes and separator with a semi&#8208;open device configuration; hygroscopic CaCl2 in the air (&#8220;CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221;) was designed as a self&#8208;healable electrolyte; which lost its water solvent at high temperatures but spontaneously absorbed water from the air to recover by itself at low temperatures. The supercapacitor was disenabled at 500 &#176;C; while it recovered after cooling in the air. Especially; it even recovered after burning around 647 &#176;C with enhanced performances. Our study offers a self&#8208;healing strategy to design high&#8208;safety; high&#8208;reliability; and fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors; which inspires a promising way to deal with general fire&#8208;related risks.

         <title>Manipulating Exchange Bias in a Van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces are formed for generating a non&#8208;antisymmetric exchange bias, where ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 is coupled to antiferromagnetic CrSe with a noncollinear spin texture and oxidized Fe3GeTe2 with a weak antiferromagnetic order. This exchange bias can be manipulated with field coolings, which opens up new routes toward controlling 2D spintronic devices based on van der Waals magnets.








Abstract
Spintronics applications of thin&#8208;film magnets require control and design of specific magnetic properties. Exchange bias, originating from the pinning of spins in a ferromagnet by these of an antiferromagnet, is a part of the highly important elements for spintronics applications. Here, an exchange bias of &#8776;90 mT in a van der Waals ferromagnet encapsulated by two antiferromagnets at 5 K, the value of which is highly tunable by the field coolings, is reported. The non&#8208;antisymmetric dependence of exchange bias on field cooling is explained through considering an uncompensated interfacial magnetic layer of an antiferromagnet with a noncollinear spin texture, and a weak antiferromagnetic order in the oxidized layer, at two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces. This work opens up new routes toward designing and controlling 2D spintronic devices made of atomically thin van der Waals magnets.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode with Reinforced Electrochemical Performance Enabled by Convertible Amorphous Li2CO3 Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;nickel cathode (Ni&#160;&#8805;&#160;90%) is developed through controlling the surface residual lithium composition with a formed amorphous Li2CO3 protective layer. This cathode can resist corrosion by air, and will be converted into a stable cathode electrolyte interphase during the electrochemical process, resulting in enhanced storage performance and extended cycle life for high&#8208;nickel cathodes.








Abstract
High&#8208;nickel (Ni &#8805; 90%) cathodes with high specific capacity hold great potential for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical application is restricted by the high interfacial reactivity under continuous air erosion and electrolyte assault. Herein, a stable high&#8208;nickel cathode is rationally designed via in situ induction of a dense amorphous Li2CO3 on the particle surface by a preemptive atmosphere control. Among the residual lithium compounds, Li2CO3 is the most thermodynamically stable one, so a dense Li2CO3 coating layer can serve as a physical protection layer to isolate the cathode from contact with moist air. Furthermore, amorphous Li2CO3 can be transformed into a robust F&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) during cycling, which reinforces the cathode's interfacial stability and improves the electrochemical performance. The assembled coin cell with this modified cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 232.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 with a superior initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 95.1%, and considerable capacity retention of 90.4% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, no slurry gelation occurs during the large&#8208;scale electrode fabrication process. This work opens a valuable perspective on the evolution of amorphous Li2CO3 in LIBs and provides guidance on protecting unstable high&#8208;capacity cathodes for energy&#8208;storage devices.

&lt;p&gt;A high-nickel cathode (Ni&#160;&#8805;&#160;90%) is developed through controlling the surface residual lithium composition with a formed amorphous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; protective layer. This cathode can resist corrosion by air, and will be converted into a stable cathode electrolyte interphase during the electrochemical process, resulting in enhanced storage performance and extended cycle life for high-nickel cathodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-nickel (Ni &#8805; 90%) cathodes with high specific capacity hold great potential for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical application is restricted by the high interfacial reactivity under continuous air erosion and electrolyte assault. Herein, a stable high-nickel cathode is rationally designed via in situ induction of a dense amorphous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the particle surface by a preemptive atmosphere control. Among the residual lithium compounds, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the most thermodynamically stable one, so a dense Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coating layer can serve as a physical protection layer to isolate the cathode from contact with moist air. Furthermore, amorphous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be transformed into a robust F-rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) during cycling, which reinforces the cathode's interfacial stability and improves the electrochemical performance. The assembled coin cell with this modified cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 232.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a superior initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 95.1%, and considerable capacity retention of 90.4% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, no slurry gelation occurs during the large-scale electrode fabrication process. This work opens a valuable perspective on the evolution of amorphous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in LIBs and provides guidance on protecting unstable high-capacity cathodes for energy-storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Long&#8208;Range Order from a Freeform Disordered Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general framework for emerging long&#8208;range ordered phase distribution in a freeform disordered metasurface is established based on disorder parameter engineering and topology optimization. Within this general framework, the order distribution and the corresponding functionality can be inversely optimized and artificially designed, offering a new freedom to design material functionality.








Abstract
Recently, disordered metasurfaces have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in imaging, holography, and wavefront shaping. However, how to emerge long&#8208;range ordered phase distribution in disordered metasurfaces remains an outstanding problem. Here, a general framework is proposed to generate a spatially homogeneous in&#8208;plane phase distribution from a disordered metasurface, by engineering disorder parameters together with topology optimization. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an all&#8208;dielectric disordered supercell metasurface with relatively homogeneous in&#8208;plane phase fluctuation is designed by disorder parameter engineering, manifesting as polarization conversion&#8208;dependent random scattering or unidirectional transmission. Then, a topology optimization approach is utilized to overcome the lattice coupling effect and to further improve the homogeneity of complex electric field fluctuation. In comparison with the initial supercell metasurface, both the phase fluctuation range and the relative efficiency of the topology&#8208;optimized freeform metasurface are significantly improved, leading to a long&#8208;range ordered electric field distribution. Moreover, three experimental realizations are performed, all of which agree well with the theoretical results. This methodology may inspire more exotic optical phenomena and find more promising applications in disordered metasurfaces and disordered&#160;optics.

         <title>Competitive Coordination&#8208;Oriented Monodispersed Ruthenium Sites in Conductive MOF/LDH Hetero&#8208;Nanotree Catalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF)/layered double hydroxide (LDH) hetero&#8208;nanotree structure coupled with monodisperse Ru sites is constructed via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy. Based on a competitive coordination process, Ru&#63743;N sites are precisely anchored by rich&#8208;amino organic linkers. The chemical and electronic structure of the hetero&#8208;nanotree catalysts are well modified and lead to a superior overall water&#8208;splitting performance in alkaline media.








Abstract
Rational exploration of efficient, inexpensive, and robust electrocatalysts is critical for the efficient water splitting. Conjugated conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) with multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to construct bifunctional heterostructure catalysts are considered as an efficient but complicated strategy. Here, the fabrication of a cMOF/LDH hetero&#8208;nanotree array catalyst (CoNiRu&#8208;NT) coupled with monodispersed ruthenium (Ru) sites via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy is reported. Rich&#8208;amino hexaiminotriphenylene linkers coordinate with the LDH nanotrunk to form cMOF nanobranches, providing numerous anchoring sites to precisely confine and stabilize Ru&#63743;N4 sites. Moreover, monodispersed and reduced Ru moieties facilitate H2O adsorption and dissociation, and the heterointerface between the cMOF and the LDH further modifies the chemical and electronic structures. Optimized CoNiRu&#8208;NT displays a significant increase in electrochemical water&#8208;splitting properties in alkaline media, affording low overpotentials of 22&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 255&#160;mV at 20 mA cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. In an actual electrochemical system, CoNiRu&#8208;NT drives an overall water splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.47&#160;V to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This performance is comparable to that of pure noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials and superior to most reported MOF&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Neisseria meningitidis Opca Protein/MnO2 Hybrid Nanoparticles for Overcoming the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier to Treat Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By loading the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate in hollow manganese dioxide nanoparticles with surface modification of Opca protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a bionic nanotherapeutic system is constructed to effectively overcome the blood&#8211;brain barrier for improved glioblastoma therapy.








Abstract
The major hurdle in glioblastoma therapy is the low efficacy of drugs crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Neisseria meningitidis is known to specifically enrich in the central nervous system through the guidance of an outer membrane invasion protein named Opca. Here, by loading a chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) in hollow manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles with surface modification of the Opca protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a bionic nanotherapeutic system (MTX@MnO2&#8208;Opca) is demonstrated to effectively overcome the BBB. The presence of the Opca protein enables the drug to cross the BBB and penetrate into tumor tissues. After accumulating in glioblastoma, the nanotherapeutic system catalyzes the decomposition of excess H2O2 in the tumor tissue and thereby generates O2, which alleviates tumor hypoxia and enhances the effect of chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. This bionic nanotherapeutic system may exhibit great potential in the treatment of glioblastoma.

         <title>Reshaping the Tumor Immune Microenvironment Based on a Light&#8208;Activated Nanoplatform for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#160;self&#8208;supplying&#160;nanoplatform&#160;for&#160;enhancing PDT/RT and reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment exhibits effective inhibition of the growth of both primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. Light activation of hole generation can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to produce oxygen for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy, but also promotes the TAMs&#8217; polarization to M1 phenotype, and decreases the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;.








Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) always causes poor antitumor immune efficacy, prone to relapse and metastasis. Herein, novel poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) modified BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 (BFO/BWO) with a p&#8211;n type heterojunction is constructed for reshaping the immunosuppressive TME. Reactive oxygen species can be generated under light activation by the well&#8208;separated hole (h+)&#8211;electron (e&#8722;) pairs owing to the heterojunction in BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs. Interestingly, h+ can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to generate O2 for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiotherapy (RT), but also promotes tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, which is beneficial to decrease the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Importantly, such a light&#8208;activated nanoplatform, combining with RT can efficiently activate and recruit cytotoxic T lymphocytes to infiltrate in tumor tissues, as well as stimulate TAMs to M1 phenotype, dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive TME into an immunoactive one, and further boost immune memory responses. Moreover, BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs also present high performance for computed tomography imaging contrast. Taken together, this work offers a novel paradigm for achieving O2 self&#8208;supply of inorganic nanoagents and reshaping of the tumor immune microenvironment for effective inhibition of cancer as well as metastasis and recurrence.

Interestingly, h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can trigger the decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiotherapy (RT), but also promotes tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, which is beneficial to decrease the expression of HIF-1&#945;. Importantly, such a light-activated nanoplatform, combining with RT can efficiently activate and recruit cytotoxic T lymphocytes to infiltrate in tumor tissues, as well as stimulate TAMs to M1 phenotype, dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive TME into an immunoactive one, and further boost immune memory responses. Moreover, BFO/BWO-PVP NPs also present high performance for computed tomography imaging contrast. Taken together, this work offers a novel paradigm for achieving O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; self-supply of inorganic nanoagents and reshaping of the tumor immune microenvironment for effective inhibition of cancer as well as metastasis and recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resolving the Spatial Variation and Correlation of Hyperfine Spin Properties in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hyperfine interaction is an important spin quantum property in organic semiconductors. Exploiting the electroluminescence response of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to magnetic fields, large intra&#8208;device variations of this property exceeding &#8776;30% are resolved which are spatially correlated over characteristic lengths of 7 &#181;m. This has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic devices which rely on spin for their functionality.








Abstract
Devices that exploit the quantum properties of materials are widespread, with quantum information processors and quantum sensors showing significant progress. Organic materials offer interesting opportunities for quantum technologies owing to their engineerable spin properties, with spintronic operation and spin resonance magnetic&#8208;field sensing demonstrated in research grade devices, as well as proven compatibility with large&#8208;scale fabrication techniques. Yet several important challenges remain as moving toward scaling these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle quantum devices to larger integrated logic systems or spatially smaller sensing elements, particularly those associated with the variation of quantum properties both within and between devices. Here, spatially resolved magnetoluminescence is used to provide the first 2D map of a hyperfine spin property&#8212;the Overhauser field&#8212;in traditional organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Intra&#8208;device variabilities are found to exceed &#8776;30% while spatially correlated behavior is exhibited on lengths beyond 7&#160;&#181;m, similar in size to pixels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active&#8208;matrix OLED arrays, which has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic quantum devices.

         <title>Advanced Materials for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vaccines have been a major focus of the global SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 response. Advanced materials have played a role in enabling the current generation of effective vaccines that have been deployed, and also they have shown promise in next&#8208;generation vaccines that are being developed in response to the pandemic.








Abstract
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), has killed untold millions worldwide and has hurtled vaccines into the spotlight as a go&#8208;to approach to mitigate it. Advances in virology, genomics, structural biology, and vaccine technologies have enabled a rapid and unprecedented rollout of COVID&#8208;19 vaccines, although much of the developing world remains unvaccinated. Several new vaccine platforms have been developed or deployed against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, with most targeting the large viral Spike immunogen. Those that safely induce strong and durable antibody responses at low dosages are advantageous, as well are those that can be rapidly produced at a large scale. Virtually all COVID&#8208;19 vaccines and adjuvants possess nanoscale or microscale dimensions and represent diverse and unique biomaterials. Viral vector vaccine platforms, lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and multimeric display technologies for subunit vaccines have received much attention. Nanoscale vaccine adjuvants have also been used in combination with other vaccines. To deal with the ongoing pandemic, and to be ready for potential future ones, advanced vaccine technologies will continue to be developed in the near future. Herein, the recent use of advanced materials used for developing COVID&#8208;19 vaccines is summarized.

         <title>Next Evolution in organ&#8208;scale Biofabrication: Bioresin Design for Rapid high&#8208;resolution Vat Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of bioprinting has made significant advancements in recent years and allowed for the precise deposition of biomaterials and cells. However, within this field lies a major challenge, which is developing high resolution constructs, with complex architectures. In an effort to overcome these challenges a biofabrication technique known as vat polymerisation is being increasingly investigated due to its high fabrication accuracy and control of resolution (&#956;m scale). Despite the progress made in developing hydrogel precursors for bioprinting techniques, such as extrusion based bioprinting, there is a major lack in developing hydrogel precursor bioresins for vat polymerisation. This is due to the specific unique properties and characteristics required for vat polymerisation, from lithography to the latest volumetric printing. This is of major concern as the shortage of bioresins available has a significant impact on progressing this technology and exploring its full potential, including speed, resolution and scale. Therefore, this review discusses the key requirements that need to be addressed in successfully developing a bioresin. The influence of monomer architecture and bioresin composition on printability is described, along with key fundamental parameters that can be altered to increase printing accuracy. Finally, recent advancements in bioresins are discussed together with future directions.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling, Robust and Adhesive Extracellular Matrix&#8208;Mimicking Hydrogel Used as Intraoral Dressing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the wet and dynamic environment of the oral cavity, the healing of intraoral wounds, such as tooth extraction wounds, requires stable and firm wound dressings. In clinical practice, cotton balls and gauze, sponge plugs, or sutures are used to treat extraction wounds, but none of these means can continuously isolate the wound from the intraoral environment and provide ideal healing conditions. Herein, inspired by the natural extracellular matrix, a family of wound dressings was developed for intraoral wound repair. Infiltrating a ductile long&#8208;chain hydrogel network into a prefabricated, sturdy macromolecular meshwork and in situ crosslinking endowed the composite hydrogel with controllable swelling behaviors and robust mechanical properties. The macromolecular meshwork functioned as the backbone to support the composite and restricts the swelling of the long&#8208;chain hydrogel network. In vitro tests verified that this dressing could provide durable protection for intraoral wounds against complex irritations. Furthermore, accelerated wound healing occurred when the dressing was applied in vivo on a canine tooth extraction model due to the effective reduction of acute inflammation. These results suggest the bioinspired hydrogel has great potential for application as an intraoral dressing.

         <title>Photoresponsive Vaccine&#8208;Like CAR&#8208;M System with High&#8208;Efficiency Central Immune Regulation for Inflammation&#8208;Related Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed concept of the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM system makes a breakthrough in the treatment of inflammation&#8208;related depression. By precisely regulating inflammation in the central nervous system, this drug delivery system can exert a light&#8208;response immune regulation effect, inhibit the polarization of M1 type microglia, and produce a vaccine&#8208;like effect to prevent inflammation&#8208;related depression.








Abstract
Increasing evidence suggests that activation of microglia&#8208;induced neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of depression. Consequently, targeting the central nervous system to reduce neuroinflammation holds great promise for the treatment of depression. However, few drugs can enter the brain via a circulatory route through the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) to reach the central nervous system efficiently, which limits the pharmacological treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein, a light&#8208;responsive system named UZPM, consisting of blue&#8208;emitting NaYF4:Yb, Tm@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (UCNP@ZIF&#8208;8), photoacid (PA), and melatonin (MT) is developed to address the above issues. Meanwhile, UZPM is introduced into macrophages by functional liposomes fusion and modified with hydroxylamine groups on the cell surface. Aldehyde&#8208;modified cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein&#8208;4 (CTLA&#8208;4) is used as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting group to modify the surface of macrophages by aldehyde/hydroxylamine condensation to precisely target central M1&#8208;type microglia (CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM drug delivery system can efficiently penetrate the BBB, targeting centrally activated microglia, and thus, inhibiting the M1&#8208;type polarization of microglia, producing continuous vaccine&#8208;like anti&#8208;inflammatory effects that prevent the occurrence and development of inflammation&#8208;related depression.

Herein, a light-responsive system named UZPM, consisting of blue-emitting NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Yb, Tm@zeolitic-imidazolate framework (UCNP@ZIF-8), photoacid (PA), and melatonin (MT) is developed to address the above issues. Meanwhile, UZPM is introduced into macrophages by functional liposomes fusion and modified with hydroxylamine groups on the cell surface. Aldehyde-modified cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) is used as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting group to modify the surface of macrophages by aldehyde/hydroxylamine condensation to precisely target central M1-type microglia (CAR-M-UZPM). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the CAR-M-UZPM drug delivery system can efficiently penetrate the BBB, targeting centrally activated microglia, and thus, inhibiting the M1-type polarization of microglia, producing continuous vaccine-like anti-inflammatory effects that prevent the occurrence and development of inflammation-related depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Facile, Protein&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Theranostic Strategy for Multimodal&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic and Photothermal Immunotherapy In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature's ability to achieve molecular self&#8208;assembly, a facile, protein&#8208;derived supramolecular theranostic strategy for multimodal&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy in vivo is demonstrated.








Abstract
Theranostic systems that permit both diagnosis and treatment in vivo are highly appealing means by which to meet the demands of precision medicine. However, most such systems remain subject to issues related to complex molecular design and synthesis, potential toxicity, and possible photoactivity changes. Herein, a novel supramolecular theranostic strategy involving biomarker protein activation (BPA) and a host&#8211;guest strategy is proposed. To exemplify BPA, a facile &#8220;one&#8208;for&#8208;all&#8221; nanotheranostic agent for both albumin detection and cancer treatment is demonstrated, which utilizes a nanoparticulate heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY dye derivative (B4&#160;NPs). The fluorescence and photoactivity of BODIPY dyes are completely suppressed by aggregation&#8208;induced self&#8208;quenching in the nanoparticulate state. However, a Balb/c nude mouse model is used to confirm that following the disassembly of injected B4&#160;NPs, BODIPY specifically binds albumin in vivo, accompanied by significantly enhanced biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency. More importantly, this supramolecular host&#8211;guest BPA strategy enables the resultant nanoplatform to act as a facile and efficient strategy for photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Programmable Matter: The Nanoparticle Atom and DNA Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable atom equivalents (PAEs) are nanoparticles functionalized with a dense shell of DNA containing short single&#8208;stranded regions called &#8220;sticky ends.&#8221; When PAEs with complementary sticky ends interact, hybridization leads to DNA &#8220;bonds&#8221; between nanoparticles. PAEs can be assembled into crystalline arrangements where unlike atomic systems, the &#8220;atom&#8221; (nanoparticle) and &#8220;bond&#8221; (DNA) can be tuned independently to yield designer materials.








Abstract
Colloidal crystal engineering with DNA has led to significant advances in bottom&#8208;up materials synthesis and a new way of thinking about fundamental concepts in chemistry. Here, programmable atom equivalents (PAEs), comprised of nanoparticles (the &#8220;atoms&#8221;) functionalized with DNA (the &#8220;bonding elements&#8221;), are assembled through DNA hybridization into crystalline lattices. Unlike atomic systems, the &#8220;atom&#8221; (e.g., the nanoparticle shape, size, and composition) and the &#8220;bond&#8221; (e.g., the DNA length and sequence) can be tuned independently, yielding designer materials with unique catalytic, optical, and biological properties. In this review, nearly three decades of work that have contributed to the evolution of this class of programmable matter is chronicled, starting from the earliest examples based on gold&#8208;core PAEs, and then delineating how advances in synthetic capabilities, DNA design, and fundamental understanding of PAE&#8208;PAE interactions have led to new classes of functional materials that, in several cases, have no natural equivalent.

         <title>Controlled Activation of TRPV1 Channels on Microglia to Boost Their Autophagy for Clearance of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein and Enhance Therapy of Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugates of ultra&#8208;small Cu2&#8211;xSe nanoparticles and TRPV1 antibody can efficiently target microglia and photothermally activate their TRPV1 channels under the second near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, which promotes the efficient influx of Ca2+ to boost their autophagy. The enhanced autophagy of microglia improves the phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn and boosts the therapeutic efficacy of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized with accumulation of Lewy bodies with a major component of fibrillar alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn). Herein, boosting PD therapeutic efficacy by enhancing the autophagy of microglia to phagocytose and degrade &#945;&#8208;syn via controlled opening of their surface TRPV1 channels with rationally designed photothermal nanoagent is reported. The Cu2&#8722;xSe&#8208;anti&#8208;TRPV1 nanoparticles (CS&#8208;AT NPs) are fabricated to target the microglia and open their surface TRPV1 channels under the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) laser irradiation to cause influx of Ca2+ to activate ATG5 and Ca2+/CaMKK2/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, which promote phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn. The CS&#8208;AT NPs are efficiently delivered by focused ultrasound into striatum of PD mice with high expression of TRPV1 receptors. The athletic ability of PD mice treated by CS&#8208;AT NPs and NIR&#8208;II irradiation is significantly improved due to the phagocytotic clearance of &#945;&#8208;syn by microglia with enhanced autophagy. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, ionized calcium binding adapter protein 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and pSer129&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn (p&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn) of treated PD mice are almost recovered to the normal levels of healthy mice. This study provides insights into the activation of microglial autophagy by targeting surface ion channels to improve the treatment of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Preconstructing Asymmetric Interface in Air Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries is proposed. Precise loading of the electrocatalysts at the asymmetric interface is achieved to obtain zinc&#8211;air batteries cycling at 25 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to various electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford great potential toward next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage. Nevertheless, the oxygen redox reactions at the air cathode are highly sluggish in kinetics to induce poor energy efficiency and limited cycling lifespan. Air cathodes with asymmetric configurations significantly promote the electrocatalytic efficiency of the loaded electrocatalysts, whereas rational synthetic methodology to effectively fabricate asymmetric air cathodes remains insufficient. Herein, a strategy of asymmetric interface preconstruction is proposed to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for high&#8208;performance rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, the asymmetric interface is preconstructed by introducing immiscible organic&#8211;water diphases within the air cathode, at which the electrocatalysts are in situ formed to achieve an asymmetric configuration. The as&#8208;fabricated asymmetric air cathodes realize high working rates of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, long cycling stability of 3400 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and over 100 cycles under harsh conditions of 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 25 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to many electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up. This work provides an effective strategy toward advanced asymmetric air cathodes with high electrocatalytic efficiency and significantly promotes the performance of rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Stretchable Mesh Nanoelectronics for 3D Single&#8208;Cell Chronic Electrophysiology from Developing Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building cyborg brain organoids through the integration of stretchable mesh nanoelectronics with human induced pluripotent stem cell derived progenitors and neurons through organogenesis is reported. The stretchable mesh nanoelectronics can adapt the morphogenesis of organoids and record organoid&#8208;wide electrophysiology at single&#8208;cell, millisecond resolution, chronically and noninvasively. Emergence and evolution of single&#8208;unit action potentials over the time course of brain organoid development are measured.








Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived brain organoids have shown great potential for studies of human brain development and neurological disorders. However, quantifying the evolution of the electrical properties of brain organoids during development is currently limited by the measurement techniques, which cannot provide long&#8208;term stable 3D bioelectrical interfaces with developing brain organoids. Here, a cyborg brain organoid platform is reported, in which &#8220;tissue&#8208;like&#8221; stretchable mesh nanoelectronics are designed to match the mechanical properties of brain organoids and to be folded by the organogenetic process of progenitor or stem cells, distributing stretchable electrode arrays across the 3D organoids. The tissue&#8208;wide integrated stretchable electrode arrays show no interruption to brain organoid development, adapt to the volume and morphological changes during brain organoid organogenesis, and provide long&#8208;term stable electrical contacts with neurons within brain organoids during development. The seamless and noninvasive coupling of electrodes to neurons enables long&#8208;term stable, continuous recording and captures the emergence of single&#8208;cell action potentials from early&#8208;stage brain organoid development.

         <title>Creating a Ferromagnetic Ground State with Tc Above Room Temperature in a Paramagnetic Alloy through Non&#8208;Equilibrium Nanostructuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hitherto&#8208;unknown ferromagnetic ground state with Curie temperature above room temperature can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by non&#8208;equilibrium nanostructuring. The ferromagnetic ground state originates from surface stress&#8208;induced tetragonal distortion in the ligaments of the nanoporous network. The study demonstrates a route for reaching conventionally inaccessible magneto&#8208;electronic states and achieving an on/off ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic switching for potential applications.








Abstract
Materials with strong magnetostructural coupling have complex energy landscapes featuring multiple local ground states, thus making it possible to switch among distinct magnetic&#8208;electronic properties. However, these energy minima are rarely accessible by a mere application of an external stimuli to the system in equilibrium state. A ferromagnetic ground state, with Tc above room temperature, can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by nonequilibrium nanostructuring. By a dealloying process, bulk chemically disordered FeRh alloys are transformed into a nanoporous structure with the topology of a few nanometer&#8208;sized ligaments and nodes. Magnetometry and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy reveal the coexistence of two magnetic ground states, a conventional low&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;glass and a hitherto&#8208;unknown robust ferromagnetic phase. The emergence of the ferromagnetic phase is validated by density functional theory calculations showing that local tetragonal distortion induced by surface stress favors ferromagnetic ordering. The study provides a means for reaching conventionally inaccessible magnetic states, resulting in a complete on/off ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic switching over a broad temperature range.

         <title>All&#8208;dielectric metasurface&#8208;enabled multiple vortex emissions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
On&#8208;chip integrated micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale vortex lasers are key elements for addressing the exponentially growing demand for information capacity. Although tunable vortex micro&#8208;lasers have been reported, each laser pulse still possesses one particular topological charge and requires additional multiplexing. In this study, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of coherent laser arrays with different topological charges by combining metalenses with semiconductor micro&#8208;lasers. A TiO2 vortex metalens converts two orbital angular momentum beams into the same diffraction&#8208;limit spot with opposite circular polarizations through spin&#8208;to&#8208;orbital conversion. Consequently, the micro&#8208;laser emission at the focal spot, which can be decomposed into two circularly polarized beams, is collimated into vortex micro&#8208;laser beams with two different topological charges through a time&#8208;reversal process. This concept is extended to a 2&#215;2 metalens array by introducing off&#8208;axis terms, and eight topological charges are produced simultaneously. This research is a significant step toward the on&#8208;chip integration of micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;lasers.

         <title>Synergistic Energy Absorption Mechanisms of Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here, we report a unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#8208;based architected materials. The architected materials consist of repeating unit cells of bistable tilted LCE beams sandwiched between stiff supports. The viscoelastic behavior of the LCE causes the energy absorption to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship, which can be modulated by changing the degree of mesogen alignment and the loading direction relative to the director. For a strain rate of 600 s&#8211;1, the unit cell exhibits up to a 5&#160;MJ/m3 energy absorption density, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the same structure fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane elastomer and is comparable to the dissipation from irreversible plastic deformation exhibited by denser metals. For a multilayered structure of unit cells, nonuniform buckling of the different layers produces additional viscoelastic dissipation. This synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with the number of layers. The sequence of cell collapse can be controlled by grading the beam thickness to further promote viscous dissipation and enhance the energy absorption density. We envision that our study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.

         <title>Materials Engineering for Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in material and architecture engineering of air&#8208;water&#8208;harvesting materials have promoted remarkable progress toward the atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology. This perspective discusses the fundamental insights of how different material designs affect the water&#8208;material interactions in advancing AWH technology.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is emerging as a promising strategy to produce fresh water from abundant airborne moisture to overcome the global clean water shortage. The ubiquitous moisture resources allow AWH to be free from geographical restrictions and potentially realize decentralized applications, making it a vital parallel or supplementary freshwater production approach to liquid water resource&#8208;based technologies. Recent advances in regulating chemical properties and micro/nanostructures of moisture&#8208;harvesting materials have demonstrated new possibilities to promote enhanced device performance and new understandings. This perspective aims to provide a timely overview on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials design and how they serve as the active components in AWH. First, the key processes of AWH, including vapor condensation, droplet nucleation, growth, and departure are outlined, and the desired material properties based on the fundamental mechanisms are discussed. Then, how tailoring materials&#8208;water interactions at the molecular level play a vital role in realizing high water uptake and low energy consumption is shown. Last, the challenges and outlook on further improving AWH from material designs and system engineering aspects are highlighted.

         <title>3D Microvascularized Tissue Models by Laser&#8208;Based Cavitation Molding of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel method to generate channels in collagen hydrogels with sub&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m resolution using non&#8208;ablative cavitation&#8208;based laser patterning. These channels can be used for the direct seeding of endothelial cells to form an artificial microvasculature. Cavitation&#8208;based patterning preserves the viability of cells in the hydrogels arranged either as single cells or spheroids, enabling complex microvascularized tissue models.








Abstract
3D tissue models recapitulating human physiology are important for fundamental biomedical research, and they hold promise to become a new tool in drug development. An integrated and defined microvasculature in 3D tissue models is necessary for optimal cell functions. However, conventional bioprinting only allows the fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds containing vessel&#8208;like structures with large diameters (&gt;100&#160;&#181;m) and simple geometries. Recent developments in laser photoablation enable the generation of this type of structure with higher resolution and complexity, but the photo&#8208;thermal process can compromise cell viability and hydrogel integrity. To address these limitations, the present work reports in situ 3D patterning of collagen hydrogels by femtosecond laser irradiation to create channels and cavities with diameters ranging from 20 to 60&#160;&#181;m. In this process, laser irradiation of the hydrogel generates cavitation gas bubbles that rearrange the collagen fibers, thereby creating stable microchannels. Such 3D channels can be formed in cell&#8208; and organoid&#8208;laden hydrogel without affecting the viability outside the lumen and can enable the formation of artificial microvasculature by the culture of endothelial cells and cell media perfusion. Thus, this method enables organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and 3D tissue models featuring complex microvasculature.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a novel method to generate channels in collagen hydrogels with sub-100-&#181;m resolution using non-ablative cavitation-based laser patterning. These channels can be used for the direct seeding of endothelial cells to form an artificial microvasculature. Cavitation-based patterning preserves the viability of cells in the hydrogels arranged either as single cells or spheroids, enabling complex microvascularized tissue models.

&lt;p&gt;3D tissue models recapitulating human physiology are important for fundamental biomedical research, and they hold promise to become a new tool in drug development. An integrated and defined microvasculature in 3D tissue models is necessary for optimal cell functions. However, conventional bioprinting only allows the fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds containing vessel-like structures with large diameters (&amp;gt;100&#160;&#181;m) and simple geometries. Recent developments in laser photoablation enable the generation of this type of structure with higher resolution and complexity, but the photo-thermal process can compromise cell viability and hydrogel integrity. To address these limitations, the present work reports in situ 3D patterning of collagen hydrogels by femtosecond laser irradiation to create channels and cavities with diameters ranging from 20 to 60&#160;&#181;m.

         <title>Multiple Responsive CPL Switches in an Enantiomeric Pair of Perovskite Confined in Lanthanide MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are embedded in homochiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) without any ligand passivation. Experimental results indicate that MAPbBr3 NCs adopted a chiral packing in enantiomeric MOFs by Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O bonds. The CPL of composites possesses the multiple external&#8208;stimulate responsive reversibility. 








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches have attracted widespread attention due to their potential applications in advanced information technologies. However, the design and fabrication of solid&#8208;state multiple&#8208;responsive CPL switches remain challenging. Here, through self&#8208;assembly of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), a pair of crystalline enantiomeric (P)&#8208;(+)/(M)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;EuMOF&#8835;MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;) adducts is prepared, where the achiral MAPbBr3 perovskite NCs embedded into chiral MOFs inherit the chirality of host MOFs by host&#8208;guest Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O coordination bonds, which is demonstrated by synchrotron&#8208;radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The chiral adducts show enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), good thermal stability of CPL in air, and photoswitchable CPL properties upon altering different UV irradiation. Based on two chiral emission centers and their different characteristics, reversible CPL switches are realized upon a diversity of external stimuli, for example, chemicals (water /CH3NH3Br solution) or temperatures (room temperature/high temperature). Benefiting from the extraordinary stimuli&#8208;responsive and highly reversible switchable CPL, multiple information encryptions and decryptions integrated with CPL, together with a chiroptical logic gate are successfully designed. This work opens a new avenue to generally fabricate solid&#8208;state CPL composite materials and develops new applications based on switchable CPL.

         <title>Doping Control of Magnetic Anisotropy for Stable Antiskyrmion Formation in Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. It is demonstrated that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy, and subtle balance between uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, vortex&#8208;like topological spin textures, have attracted much interest in a wide range of research fields from fundamental physics to spintronics applications. Recently, growing attention is also paid to antiskyrmions emerging with opposite topological charge in non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnets with D2d or S4 symmetry. In these magnets, complex interplay among anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic dipolar interactions generates various magnetic textures. However, the precise role of these magnetic interactions in stabilizing antiskyrmions remains to be elucidated. In this work, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. The authors&#8217; magnetometry study, supported by ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, shows that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy. In particular, doping with Pd induces easy&#8208;axis anisotropy, giving rise to formation of antiskyrmions, while a temperature&#8208;induced spin reorientation is observed in an Rh&#8208;doped compound. In combination with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, the stability of antiskyrmion as functions of uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is quantitatively analyzed, and demonstrated that subtle balance between them is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.

Through changing mixed stacking into segregated stacking mode, triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex demonstrates a low CT degree and a small counter pitch angle between TP and F4TCNQ molecules, benefiting for breaking the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state for realizing the near&#8208;infrared emission with a maximum peak of 770 nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 5.4%.








Abstract
Harvesting the narrow bandgap excitons of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes for the achievement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission has attracted intensive attention for its fundamental importance and practical application. Herein, the triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) CT organic complex is designed and fabricated via the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process, which demonstrates the NIR emission with a maximum peak of 770&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.4%. The segregated stacking mode of TP&#8208;F4TCNQ CT complex based on the multiple types of intermolecular interaction has a low CT degree of 0.00103 and a small counter pitch angle of 40&#176; between F4TCNQ and TP molecules, which breaks the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state, resulting in the effective NIR emission. Acting as the promising candidates for the active optical waveguide in the NIR region beyond 760&#160;nm, the self&#8208;assembled TP&#8208;F4TCNQ single&#8208;crystalline organic microwires display an ultralow optical&#8208;loss coefficient of 0.060&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. This work holds considerable insights for the exploration of novel NIR&#8208;emissive organic materials via an universal &#8220;cocrystal engineering&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Constructing Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cell with Efficiency of 22.0% via Reduced Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss and Broadened Absorption Spectra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing ClFA+ cation to reduce the voltage loss of perovskite front subcell and using chloride substitution to broaden the absorption spectra of organic rear subcell, a monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell is constructed, and the power conversion efficiency reaches 22.0%.








Abstract
Combining the high stability under UV light of the wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) and the broad near&#8208;infrared absorption spectra of the narrow bandgap (NBG) organic solar cells (OSCs), the perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as front cell and the NBG OSC as rear cell have attracted attention . However, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite/organic TSCs needs to be further improved. Herein, nonradiative charge recombination loss is reduced through bulk defect passivation in the WBG pero&#8208;SC front subcell and broadening the range of absorption spectra of the NBG OSC rear cell. For the WBG pero&#8208;SCs, an organic cation chloro&#8208;formamidinium is introduced into FA0.6MA0.4Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 to passivate the bulk defects in the perovskite film and the WBG pero&#8208;SC displays high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and high fill factor of 83.0%. For the NBG OSCs, a new infrared&#8208;absorbing organic small molecule acceptor BTPV&#8208;4Cl&#8208;eC9 is designed and synthesized. Then, a monolithic perovskite/organic TSC is fabricated with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as the front cell and the NBG OSC as the rear cell, and the TSC demonstrates high power conversion efficiency up to 22.0%. The results indicate that the perovskite/organic TSC is promising for future commercialization.

         <title>Andreev Interference in the Surface Accumulation Layer of Half&#8208;Shell InAsSb/Al Hybrid Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. The gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al hybrid nanowires is studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field.








Abstract
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. In this letter, the gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al nanowires is studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field. Both uniform hybrid nanowires and devices featuring a short Josephson junction fabricated by shadow lithography, exhibit periodic modulation of the switching current. The period corresponds to a flux quantum through the nanowire diameter and is consistent with Andreev bound states occupying a cylindrical surface accumulation layer. The spatial distribution is tunable by a gate potential as expected from electrostatic models.

         <title>Vertical Extrusion Cryo(bio)printing for Anisotropic Tissue Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting technique is reported, which concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. This method is further extended to a multimaterial format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.








Abstract
Due to the poor mechanical properties of many hydrogel bioinks, conventional 3D extrusion bioprinting is usually conducted based on the X&#8211;Y plane, where the deposited layers are stacked in the Z&#8208;direction with or without the support of prior layers. Herein, a technique is reported, taking advantage of a cryoprotective bioink to enable direct extrusion bioprinting in the vertical direction in the presence of cells, using a freezing plate with precise temperature control. Of interest, vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. Skeletal myoblasts within the 3D&#8208;cryo&#8208;bioprinted hydrogel constructs show enhanced cell viability, spreading, and alignment, compared to the same cells in the standard hydrogel constructs. This method is further extended to a multimaterial format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, such as creation of the muscle&#8211;tendon unit and the muscle&#8211;microvascular unit. The unique vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting technique presented here suggests improvements in robustness and versatility to engineer certain tissue types especially those anisotropic in nature, and may extend broad utilities in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Growing a Tenacious Hydrogel Coating from a Sticky Initiation Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative modification method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization from a sticky initiation layer, based on in situ interface redox mechanism, is proposed for mildly/controllably growing hydrogel coatings on practically any substrate's (natural or artificial materials)/medical device's surface regardless of surface topology and material category.








Abstract
Controllably coating the surfaces of substrates/medical devices with hydrogels exhibits great application potential, but lacks universal techniques. Herein, a new method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization (UV&#8208;SCIRP) from a sticky initiation layer (SIL) (SIL@UV&#8208;SCIRP), is proposed for growing hydrogel coatings. The method involves three key steps: 1) depositing a sticky polydopamine/Fe3+ coating on the surface of the substrates&#8208;SIL, 2) reducing Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions as active catalysts by UV illumination with the assistance of citric acid, and 3) conducting SCIRP in a monomer solution at room temperature for growing hydrogel coatings. In this manner, practically any substrate's surface (natural or artificial materials) can be modified by hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness and diverse compositions. The hydrogel coatings exhibit good interface bonding with the substrates and enable easy changes in their wettability and lubrication performances. Importantly, this novel method facilitates the smooth growth of uniform hydrogel lubrication coatings on the surface of a range of medical devices with complex geometries. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the slippery balls coated with hydrogel exhibited smooth movement within the catheter and esophagus. Hence, this method can prove to be a pioneering universal modification tool, especially in surface/interface science and engineering.

         <title>High&#8208;Polarizability Organic Ferroelectric Materials Doping for Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric field of Perovskite Solar Cells Realizing Efficiency over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) intensity of silicon heterojunction solar cells can be easily enhanced by selective doping to obtain high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), while it has been challenging for perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Herein, we report an effective method to enhance the BEF of FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite by doping an organic ferroelectric material, polyvinylidene fluoride:dabcoHReO4 (PVDF:DH) with high polarizability, that can be driven even by the BEF of the device itself. The polarization of PVDF:DH produces an additional electric field, which is maintained permanently and in a direction consistent with that of the BEF of the pero&#8208;SC. The BEF superposition&#160;can more sufficiently drive the charge&#8208;carrier transport and extraction, thus suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination occurring in the pero&#8208;SCs. Moreover, the PVDF:DH dopant benefits the formation of a mesoporous PbI2 film, via a typical two&#8208;step processing method, thereby promoting perovskite growth with a high crystallinity and few defects. The resulting pero&#8208;SC shows a promising PCE of 24.23% for a 0.062&#8208;cm2 device (certified PCE of 23.45%), and a remarkable PCE of 22.69% for a 1&#8208;cm2 device, along with significantly improved moisture resistances and operational stabilities.

         <title>Anti&#8208;freezing Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ternary Hydrogen Bonding for High Performance zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
The new generation flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries require enhanced mechanical property and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications. This fundamentally desires the hydrogel electrolyte to possess anti&#8208;freezing merits to resist the flexibility loss and performance decreasing at subzero temperatures. Herein, a highly flexible polysaccharide hydrogel is in&#8208;situ realized and regulated in zinc&#8208;ion batteries through the Hofmeister effect with the low concentration Zn(ClO4)2 salts to satisfy the abovementioned requirements. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions, water and polymer chains can form ternary and weak hydrogen bonding (HB), which enables the polymer chains with improved mechanical properties, breaks the HB of water to remarkably decrease the electrolyte freezing point, and reduces the amounts of free water for effectively side reaction and dendrite inhibiting. Consequently, even at &#8208;30&#160;&#176;C, the Zn(ClO4)2 in&#8208;situ optimized hydrogel electrolyte features a high ionic conductivity of 7.8 mS cm&#8722;1 and excellent flexibility, which enables the Zn/PANI battery with a reversible capacity of 70&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 under 5 A g&#8722;1 for 2500 cycles, and renders the flexible full battery with excellent cycling performances under different bending angles. This work provides a new pathway for designing high performance anti&#8208;freezing flexible batteries via the Hofmeister effect.

&lt;p&gt;The new generation flexible aqueous zinc-ion batteries require enhanced mechanical property and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications. This fundamentally desires the hydrogel electrolyte to possess anti-freezing merits to resist the flexibility loss and performance decreasing at subzero temperatures. Herein, a highly flexible polysaccharide hydrogel is in-situ realized and regulated in zinc-ion batteries through the Hofmeister effect with the low concentration Zn(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; salts to satisfy the abovementioned requirements.

         <title>Urine Microenvironment&#8208;Initiated Composite Hydrogel Patch Reconfiguration Propels Scarless Memory Repair and Reinvigoration of Urethra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Harsh urine microenvironment (UME) as an inherent hurdle endangers and renders urethral repair unreachable. Innovatively, we utilized the unfavorable UME as the design source to construct a UME&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch for realizing scarless memory repair, wherein laser&#8208;excited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mechanical strength elevation using chemically&#8208;crosslinked silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) are accessible. Intriguingly, the proposed composite scaffolds can respond to Ca2+ in urine, cause structure reconfiguration, and repress swelling to further enhance scaffold stiffness. Systematic experiments validate that ROS birth and unexpected stiffness elevation in such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds can realize scarless memory repair of urethra in vivo. Comprehensive mechanism explorations uncover that the activations of cell proliferation and collagen&#8208;related genes (e.g., MMP&#8208;1 and COL3A1) and the dampening of fibrosis&#8208;related (e.g., TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) and mechanosensitive genes (e.g., YAP/TAZ) are responsible for the scarless memory repair of such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, decreasing fibrosis and inflammation and accelerating angiogenesis. The design rationales (e.g., UME&#8208;initiated structure reconfiguration and anti&#8208;swelling) can serve as an instructive and general approach for urethra repair.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polymer Nanoparticles for Efficient Delivery of Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein With or Without Donor DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). However, clinical transition of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, we report facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ&#8208;NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR&#8208;NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm). Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ&#8208;NP induced efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR&#8208;NP also led to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ&#8208;NP and HDR&#8208;NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.

         <title>A New Strategy for Microbial Taxonomic Identification through Micro&#8208;Biosynthetic Gold Nanoparticles and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is developed for the identification of multiple classifications of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi, from kingdom to species. The features of gold nanoparticles biosynthesized by different microorganisms are analyzed by machine&#8208;learning algorithms. The levels of glucose, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#8208;dependent reductase are related to the underlying mechanism of micro&#8208;biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles.








Abstract
Microorganisms can serve as biological factories for the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials that can become useful as nanocatalysts, energy&#8208;harvesting&#8211;storage components, antibacterial agents, and biomedical materials. Herein, the development of biosynthesis of inorganic nanomaterials into a simple, stable, and accurate strategy for distinguishing microorganisms from multiple classification levels (i.e., kingdom, order, genus, and species) without gene amplification, biochemical testing, or target recognition is reported. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) biosynthesized by different microorganisms differ in color of the solution, and their features can be characterized, including the particle size, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrum, and the surface potential. The inter&#8208;relation between the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and the classification of microorganisms are exploited at different levels through machine learning to establish a taxonomic model. This model agrees well with traditional classification methods that offers a new strategy for microbial taxonomic identification. The underlying mechanism of this strategy is related to the biomolecules produced by different microorganisms including glucose, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#8208;dependent reductase that regulate the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs. This work broadens the application of biosynthesis of inorganic materials through micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and machine learning, which holds great promise as a tool for biomedical research.

         <title>Sulfuration of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Multianionic Redox and Stabilized Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurization of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs) can be achieved by ion&#8208;exchange reaction to incorporate sulfur atoms in the lattice structure of LLOs, while the surface polyanions&#8208;formation leads to the protecting layer. This facile and economical way to sulfurize LLO materials can provide multianionic redox and stabilized coordination environment thus for outstanding battery performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich transition metal oxides (LLOs) can deliver high specific capacity over 250 mAh g&#8722;1, stemming from additional contribution of oxygen redox. However, the formation of O(2&#8722;n)&#8722; (0 &lt; n&#160;&lt; 2) species and even oxygen gas during the deep oxidation stage leads to progressive structural transformation that cause voltage decay/hysteresis, sluggish kinetics, and poor thermostability, preventing real&#8208;world application of LLOs. Therefore, the substantive key relies on enhancing the anionic redox stability in LLOs. Here, a sulfuration procedure of LLOs (S&#8208;LLOs) is proposed, in which sulfur anions are incorporated into oxygen sites in the lattice structure and form polyanions on the surface. Proved by structural characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, sulfur anions in the interior lattice can reversibly participate in the redox process and enhance the integral coordination stability by mitigating undesired oxygen redox. Moreover, S polyanions at the surface form a protecting layer for interfacial stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that S&#8208;LLO demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 307.8 mAh g&#8722;1, an outstanding capacity retention rate of 91.5% after 200 cycles, along with excellent voltage maintenance, rate capability, and thermostability. The sulfuration process of LLOs with multianionic redox mechanism highlights a promising strategy to design novel high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials with superior cycling performance.

Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, including zinc&#8208;iodine redox flow batteries and static zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, are promising candidates for future grid&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage. They are safe with great theoretical capacity, high energy and power density. Nevertheless, to make aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries practically feasible, there are quite a few hurdles need to be overcome, including self&#8208;discharge, sluggish kinetics, low energy density, and instability of Zn metal anodes. This article first reviews the electrochemistry in aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, including the flow and static battery configurations and their electrode reactions. Then we discuss the fundamental questions of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries and highlight the key strategies and recent accomplishments in tackling the challenges. Last, we share our thoughts on the future research development in aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Strain Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures Triggered by a Spin&#8208;Crossover Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered spin&#8208;crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks are deterministically assembled with other 2D materials, such as graphene or WSe2, forming van der Waals heterostructures. The strain concomitant to the spin transition clearly switches the electrical and optical properties of the 2D material. Thus, spin&#8208;crossover van der Waals heterostructures represent a new route for band engineering in low&#8208;dimensional materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide the possibility of engineering new materials with emergent functionalities that are not accessible in another way. These heterostructures are formed by assembling layers of different materials used as building blocks. Beyond inorganic 2D crystals, layered molecular materials remain still rather unexplored, with only few examples regarding their isolation as atomically thin layers. Here, the family of van der Waals heterostructures is enlarged by introducing a molecular building block able to produce strain: the so&#8208;called spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). In these metal&#8211;organic materials, a spin transition can be induced by applying external stimuli like light, temperature, pressure, or an electric field. In particular, smart vdWHs are prepared in which the electronic and optical properties of the 2D material (graphene and WSe2) are clearly switched by the strain concomitant to the spin transition. These molecular/inorganic vdWHs represent the deterministic incorporation of bistable molecular layers with other 2D crystals of interest in the emergent fields of straintronics and band engineering in low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Electronic Properties and Carrier Dynamics at the Alloy Interfaces of WS2xSe2&#8722;2x Spiral Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2xSe2&#8722;2x spiral nanosheets demonstrate quadratically enhanced strong layer&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation effects. The atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images and scanning tunneling spectroscopy maps at the WS/WSe interfaces demonstrate electron scattering at the alloy interfaces at deeper energy levels, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes inferred from pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy measurements.








Abstract
Electronic properties at the interfaces between different&#8208;composition domains of 2D&#8208;alloys are key for their optical, electronic, and optoelectronic applications. Understanding the interfacial electronic structures and carrier dynamics is essential for designing and fabricating devices that use these alloys. Here, WS2xSe2&#8722;2x spiral nanosheets are prepared using the physical vapor deposition method, and the nonlinear optical and electronic properties, as well as the carrier dynamics at the interfaces between the WS and WSe domains, are studied. Second&#8208;harmonic generation tests demonstrate that these nanosheets exhibit a very strong layer&#8208;dependent nonlinear optical effect. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal that S and Se atoms are non&#8208;uniformly distributed, forming WS domains, WSe domains, and defect&#8208;related areas. Atomic STM images and STS maps reveal enhanced local density of states by electron scattering at the WS/WSe interfaces, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes observed in pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy measurements. This work provides valuable interfacial characterization of 2D&#8208;alloy materials, using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The obtained insights are likely to be useful for prospective applications.

This work provides valuable interfacial characterization of 2D-alloy materials, using state-of-the-art methods with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The obtained insights are likely to be useful for prospective applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Switching of the Number of Skyrmions in a Magnetic Nanodot by Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is realized, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is non&#8208;volatile and reversible. The results open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, non&#8208;volatile, and multi&#8208;bit skyrmionic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topological swirling spin configurations that hold promise for building future magnetic memories and logic circuits. Skyrmionic devices typically rely on the electrical manipulation of a single skyrmion, but controllably manipulating a group of skyrmions can lead to more compact and memory&#8208;efficient devices. Here, an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is reported, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is non&#8208;volatile and reversible, which is crucial for multi&#8208;bit memory applications. Combined experiments and theoretical simulations reveal that the switching of skyrmion clusters is induced by the strain&#8208;mediated modification of both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and effective uniaxial anisotropy. The results not only open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, non&#8208;volatile, and multi&#8208;bit skyrmionic devices, but also offer valuable insights into the fundamental physics underlying the voltage manipulation of skyrmion clusters.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Pathway Model for the Evolution of Colloidal Compound Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;pathway model has been proposed for the evolution of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). One unique intermediate called &#8220;precursor compound&#8221; (PC) is discovered to transform to its magic&#8208;size cluster (MSC) counterpart via intramolecular reorganization. PCs can be engineered to selectively produce either ultrasmall QDs with enhanced particle yield or various MSCs, with an unprecedented high degree of control.








Abstract
A fundamental understanding of formation pathways is critical to the controlled synthesis of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. As ultrasmall&#8208;size quantum dots (QDs) sometimes emerge in reactions along with magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs), distinguishing their individual pathway of evolution is important, but has proven difficult. To decouple the evolution of QDs and MSCs, an unconventional, selective approach has been developed, along with a two&#8208;pathway model that provides a fundamental understanding of production selectivity. For on&#8208;demand production of either ultrasmall QDs or MSCs, the key enabler is in how to allow a reaction to proceed in the time prior to nucleation and growth of QDs. In this prenucleation stage, an intermediate compound forms, which is the precursor compound (PC) to the MSC. Here, the two&#8208;pathway model and the manipulation of such PCs to synthesize either ultrasmall QDs or binary and ternary MSCs are highlighted. The two&#8208;pathway model will assist the development of nucleation theory as well as provide a basis for a mechanism&#8208;enabled design and predictive synthesis of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;Functionalized Conductive Polymer Hydrogels for Electromagnetic&#8208;Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for 3D printing to precisely create 3D architectures with high design freedom and a post&#8208;printing freeze&#8211;thawing treatment protocol is proposed to transform the as&#8208;printed objects into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale, enabling customizable applications.








Abstract
The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI&#8208;shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze&#8211;thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale. The as&#8208;obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m&#8211;1 at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI&#8208;shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state of the art.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Nanofilm Electrode Arrays for Long&#8208;Term Stable Neural Interfacings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes are developed. The NEAs are encapsulated into biodissolvable polymer carriers through an efficient elastocapillary self&#8208;assembly process, enabling their reliable implantation into deep brain tissues. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months.








Abstract
Flexible neural electrodes integrated on micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates offer important opportunities for improving the stability of neuronal activity recordings during cognitive processes. However, the bending stiffness of micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates is typically two orders of magnitude higher than that of nanofilm electrodes, making it a limiting factor in electrode&#8208;tissue interfacings. Here, this limitation is overcome by developing self&#8208;assembled nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months. As an application example, the activities of the same neuronal populations are tracked across odor discrimination reversal learning and it is illustrated how dorsal striatal neurons represent and update stimulus&#8208;outcome associations across multiple timescales. The results underscore the potential of free&#8208;standing nanoscale materials for interfacing biological systems over long terms.

         <title>Soluble Organic Cathodes Enable Long Cycle Life, High Rate, and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic cathodes are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life, excellent rate capability, and a wide operation temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on bi&#8208;functional gel polymer electrolytes, which can eliminate the shuttling of the soluble organic electrode materials through molecular sieving and charge repulsion while maintaining a fast reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials free of rare transition metal elements are promising for sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign battery chemistries. However, severe shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of active materials in liquid electrolytes results in fast capacity decay, limiting their practical applications. Here, using a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) that is in situ formed on Nafion&#8208;coated separators, the shuttle reaction of organic electrodes is eliminated while maintaining the electrochemical performance. The synergy of physical confinement by GPE with tunable polymer structure and charge repulsion of the Nafion&#8208;coated separator substantially prevents the soluble organic electrode materials with different molecular sizes from shuttling. A soluble small&#8208;molecule organic electrode material of 1,3,5&#8208;tri(9,10&#8208;anthraquinonyl)benzene demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 10&#8239;000 cycles, excellent rate capability of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C, and a wide working temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on the solid&#8211;liquid conversion chemistry, which outperforms all previously reported organic cathode materials. The shielding capability of GPE can be designed and tailored toward organic electrodes with different molecular sizes, thus providing a universal resolution to the shuttling effect that all soluble electrode materials suffer.

         <title>Efficiency of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Sensitized Triplet Upconversion Doubled in Three&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the first three&#8208;component metal&#8208;free photon upconversion system on the upconversion efficiency and threshold light intensity is studied herein. While the efficiency is doubled, the threshold light intensity is also increased. The performance enhancement can be attributed to more efficient energy transfer from the sensitizer to the intermediate acceptor in combination with a high quantum yield emitter molecule.








Abstract
As in many fields, the most exciting endeavors in photon upconversion research focus on increasing the efficiency (upconversion quantum yield) and performance (anti&#8208;Stokes shift) while diminishing the cost of production. In this vein, studies employing metal&#8208;free thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers have garnered increased interest. Here, for the first time, the strategy of ternary photon upconversion is utilized with the TADF sensitizer 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN), resulting in a doubling of the upconversion quantum yield in comparison to the binary system employing p&#8208;terphenyl as the emitter. In this ternary blend, the sensitizer 4CzIPN is paired with an intermediate acceptor, 1&#8208;methylnaphthalene, in addition to the emitter molecule, p&#8208;terphenyl, yielding a normalized upconversion quantum yield of 7.6% while maintaining the 0.83&#160;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift. These results illustrate the potential benefits of utilizing this strategy of energy&#8208;funneling, previously used only with heavy&#8208;metal based sensitizers, to increase the performance of these photon upconversion systems.

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancement of piezoelectricity by external stimuli is advantageous for its simple and in situ control, and compatibility with other functionalities. In this work, light is shown to be a powerful control parameter to induce a sevenfold enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient in BiFeO3 single crystals due to the bulk photovoltaic and Schottky barrier effects, offering potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches are well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored, despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, it is shown that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of BiFeO3 single crystals. A series of measurements based on piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, under illumination, reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a sevenfold increase. This phenomenon is explained with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open&#8208;circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Sprayed Starvation/Chemodynamic Therapeutic Gel for Post&#8208;Surgical Treatment of IDH1 (R132H) Glioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel of GOx@MnCaP@fibrin is developed for post&#8208;surgical treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma, through depleting intratumoral glucose and generating high levels of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Complete resection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma is unfeasible and the classic post&#8208;surgical chemo/radiotherapy suffers from high recurrence and low survival rate. IDH1 (R132H) cells are sensitive to low concentrations of glucose and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inherent metabolism reprograming. Hence, a starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel is developed to combat residual IDH1 (R132H) tumor cells after surgery. Briefly, glucose oxidase (GOx) is mineralized with manganese&#8208;doped calcium phosphate to form GOx@MnCaP nanoparticles, which are encapsulated into the fibrin gel (GOx@MnCaP@fibrin). After spraying gel in the surgical cavity, GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in residual IDH1 (R132H) cells and produces H2O2. The generated H2O2 is further converted into highly lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) by a Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction to further kill the residual IDH1 (R132H) cells. The as&#8208;prepared starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel shows much higher therapeutic efficacy toward IDH1 (R132H) cells than IDH1 (WT) cells, and achieves long&#8208;term survival.

         <title>Shielding Ferritin with a Biomineralized Shell Enables Efficient Modulation of Tumor Microenvironment and Targeted Delivery of Diverse Therapeutic Agents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible ferritin&#8208;based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which calcium phosphate is generated on the ferritin surface. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables efficient drug delivery to tumor and powerful tumor microenvironment modulation, but also brings additional functionalities by loading diverse drugs in the cavity and the shell for potent antitumor effects on multiple cell and patient&#8208;derived xenografts.








Abstract
Ferritin (Fn) is considered a promising carrier for targeted delivery to tumors, but the successful application in vivo has not been fully achieved yet. Herein, strong evidence is provided that the Fn receptor is expressed in liver tissues, resulting in an intercept effect in regards to tumor delivery. Building on these observations, a biomineralization technology is rationally designed to shield Fn using a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell, which can improve the delivery performance by reducing Fn interception in the liver while re&#8208;exposing it in acidic tumors. Moreover, the selective dissolution of the CaP shell not only neutralizes the acidic microenvironment but also induces the intratumoral immunomodulation and calcification. Upon multiple cell line and patient&#8208;derived xenografts, it is demonstrated that the elaboration of the highly flexible Fn@CaP chassis by loading a chemotherapeutic drug into the Fn cavity confers potent antitumor effects, and additionally encapsulating a photosensitizer into the outer shell enables a combined chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy for complete suppression of advanced tumors. Altogether, these results support Fn@CaP as a new nanoplatform for efficient modulation of the tumor microenvironment and targeted delivery of diverse therapeutic agents.

&lt;p&gt;A flexible ferritin-based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which calcium phosphate is generated on the ferritin surface. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables efficient drug delivery to tumor and powerful tumor microenvironment modulation, but also brings additional functionalities by loading diverse drugs in the cavity and the shell for potent antitumor effects on multiple cell and patient-derived xenografts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferritin (Fn) is considered a promising carrier for targeted delivery to tumors, but the successful application in vivo has not been fully achieved yet. Herein, strong evidence is provided that the Fn receptor is expressed in liver tissues, resulting in an intercept effect in regards to tumor delivery. Building on these observations, a biomineralization technology is rationally designed to shield Fn using a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell, which can improve the delivery performance by reducing Fn interception in the liver while re-exposing it in acidic tumors. Moreover, the selective dissolution of the CaP shell not only neutralizes the acidic microenvironment but also induces the intratumoral immunomodulation and calcification. Upon multiple cell line and patient-derived xenografts, it is demonstrated that the elaboration of the highly flexible Fn@CaP chassis by loading a chemotherapeutic drug into the Fn cavity confers potent antitumor effects, and additionally encapsulating a photosensitizer into the outer shell enables a combined chemo-photothermal therapy for complete suppression of advanced tumors. Altogether, these results support Fn@CaP as a new nanoplatform for efficient modulation of the tumor microenvironment and targeted delivery of diverse therapeutic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 86&#8208;functionalized Schwann cells to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis is developed.








Abstract
Failure to establish immune tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune disease. The ability to regulate autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immunosuppression represents a major challenge in the development of new strategies to treat autoimmune disease. Here, a translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208; and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86)&#8208;functionalized mouse Schwann cells (SCs) to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis (MS) in established mouse models of chronic and relapsing&#8208;remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is described. It is shown that the intravenous (i.v.) administration of immune checkpoint ligand functionalized mouse SCs modifies the course of disease and ameliorates EAE. Further, it is found that such bioengineered mouse SCs inhibit the differentiation of myelin&#8208;specific helper T cells into pathogenic T helper type&#8208;1 (Th1) and type&#8208;17 (Th17) cells, promote the development of tolerogenic myelin&#8208;specific regulatory T (Treg) cells, and resolve inflammatory central nervous system microenvironments without inducing systemic immunosuppression.

         <title>Tuning the Transport Properties of Gases in Porous Graphene Membranes with Controlled Pore Size and Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;separation membranes based on porous graphene (PG) offer ultimate permeance; however, they show low selectivity. The pore&#8208;narrowing approach, via gold deposition onto PG, allows both the thickness and the pore size of the membrane to be tuned to obtain a high number of pores below 3&#160;nm, enabling increased gas&#8211;surface interactions and molecular sieving for high gas selectivity and permeance.








Abstract
Porous graphene membranes have emerged as promising alternatives for gas&#8208;separation applications due to their atomic thickness enabling ultrahigh permeance, but they suffer from low gas selectivity. Whereas decreasing the pore size below 3&#160;nm is expected to increase the gas selectivity due to molecular sieving, it is rather challenging to generate a large number of uniform small pores on the graphene surface. Here, a pore&#8208;narrowing approach via gold deposition onto porous graphene surface is introduced to tune the pore size and thickness of the membrane to achieve a large number of small pores. Through the systematic approach, the ideal combination is determined as pore size below 3&#160;nm, obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm, to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane shows a H2/CO2 separation factor of 31.3 at H2 permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 105 GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;10&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1), which is the highest value reported to date in the 105 GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, &#8722;5.3&#160;versus &#8722;21&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for H2 and CO2, respectively, increased surface&#8211;gas interactions and molecular&#8208;sieving effect with decreasing pore size.

         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film. The plasmonic effect, super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, by MLA leads to superior sensitivity and responsivity of devices at weak near&#8208;infrared excitation powers.








Abstract
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Plasmonic metasurfaces and Au core&#8211;satellite nanoassembly (CSNA) films can strongly induce a more effective plasmonic effect by providing numerous hot spots in an intense local electromagnetic field up to wavelengths exceeding 1550&#160;nm. Hence, significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film comprising an Au CSNA and UC nanoparticles. Furthermore, an MLA polymer film is synergistically coupled with the HPU film, thereby focusing the incident near&#8208;infrared light in the micrometer region, including the plasmonic nanostructure area. Consequently, the plasmonic effect super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, significantly lowers the detectable power limit of a device, resulting in superior sensitivity and responsivity at weak excitation powers. Finally, a triple&#8208;cation perovskite&#8208;based photodetector coupled with the hybrid plasmonic UC film exhibits the excellent values of responsivity and detectivity of 9.80&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and 8.22&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at a weak power density of &#8776;0.03&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, demonstrating that the device performance is enhanced by more than 104 magnitudes over a reference sample.

         <title>A Hydrogel Ionic Circuit Based High&#8208;Intensity Iontophoresis Device for Intraocular Macromolecule and Nanoparticle Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC) is developed for highly effective intraocular delivery of macromolecule and nanoparticle drugs. The HIC&#8208;based device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87 mA cm&#8722;2) to the ocular tissue. Moreover, therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone in a nanoparticle formulation can be delivered to target tissues within 10&#8211;20 min of iontophoresis application.








Abstract
Iontophoresis is an electrical&#8208;current&#8208;based, noninvasive drug&#8208;delivery technology, which is particularly suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Current ocular iontophoresis devices use low current intensities that significantly limit macromolecule and nanoparticle (NP) delivery efficiency. Increasing current intensity leads to ocular tissue damage. Here, an iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC), for high&#8208;efficiency intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery, is described. The HIC&#8208;based device is capable of minimizing Joule heating, effectively buffering electrochemical (EC) reaction&#8208;generated pH changes, and absorbing electrode overpotential&#8208;induced heating. As a result, the device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, more than 10 times higher than current ocular iontophoresis devices) to the eye with minimal ocular cell death and tissue damage. The high&#8208;intensity iontophoresis significantly enhances macromolecule and NP delivery to both the anterior and posterior segments by up to 300 times compared to the conventional iontophoresis. Therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone are delivered to target tissue compartments within 10&#8211;20&#160;min of iontophoresis application. This study highlights the significant safety enhancement enabled by an HIC&#8208;based device design and the potential of the device to deliver therapeutic doses of macromolecule and NP ophthalmic drugs within a clinically relevant time frame.

&lt;p&gt;Iontophoresis is an electrical-current-based, noninvasive drug-delivery technology, which is particularly suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Current ocular iontophoresis devices use low current intensities that significantly limit macromolecule and nanoparticle (NP) delivery efficiency. Increasing current intensity leads to ocular tissue damage. Here, an iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC), for high-efficiency intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery, is described. The HIC-based device is capable of minimizing Joule heating, effectively buffering electrochemical (EC) reaction-generated pH changes, and absorbing electrode overpotential-induced heating. As a result, the device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, more than 10 times higher than current ocular iontophoresis devices) to the eye with minimal ocular cell death and tissue damage. The high-intensity iontophoresis significantly enhances macromolecule and NP delivery to both the anterior and posterior segments by up to 300 times compared to the conventional iontophoresis. Therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone are delivered to target tissue compartments within 10&#8211;20&#160;min of iontophoresis application. This study highlights the significant safety enhancement enabled by an HIC-based device design and the potential of the device to deliver therapeutic doses of macromolecule and NP ophthalmic drugs within a clinically relevant time frame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multivalent Noncovalent Interfacing and Cross&#8208;Linking of Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical synthetic supramolecular network is formed and interfaced to biomimetic surfaces using purely noncovalent interactions. Supramolecular synthetic copolymer bearing biotin linking group forms supramolecular networks upon addition of streptavidin, and can bind to streptavidin&#8208;modified surfaces. The architectures of these networks can be tuned by changing the biotin ratio in supramolecular copolymer and the concentration of streptavidin.








Abstract
Natural supramolecular filaments have the ability to cross&#8208;link with each other and to interface with the cellular membrane via biomolecular noncovalent interactions. This behavior allows them to form complex networks within as well as outside the cell, i.e., the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, respectively. The potential of artificial supramolecular polymers to interact through specific noncovalent interactions has so far only seen limited exploration due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions. Here, a system of synthetic supramolecular tubes that cross&#8208;link forming supramolecular networks, and at the same time bind to biomimetic surfaces by the aid of noncovalent streptavidin&#8211;biotin linkages, is demonstrated. The architecture of the networks can be engineered by controlling the density of the biotin moiety at the exterior of the tubes as well as by the concentration of the streptavidin. The presented strategy provides a pathway for designing adjustable artificial supramolecular superstructures, which can potentially yield more complex biomimetic adaptive materials.

         <title>Lateral Fully Organic P&#8211;N Diodes Created in a Single Donor&#8211;Acceptor Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lateral fully organic P&#8211;N diodes can be created in a single polymer, which exhibits a high rectification ratio &#8776;2100 and a high current density 3.83 A cm&#8722;2. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.








Abstract
P&#8211;N junctions exist in many solid&#8208;state organic devices, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. Creating P&#8211;N junctions by bulk chemical doping in a single organic material (like silicon doped by boron and phosphorus) may capitalize the vast scientific and technological groundwork established in the inorganic semiconducting field. However, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;organic&#8208;material P&#8211;N junctions are seldom reported, because the diffusion of the dopant counterions often leads to transient rectification properties. Herein, a new type of lateral fully organic diodes created in single donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) copolymer films with only one P&#8208;type dopant is reported. The achieved lateral devices exhibit high current densities of &#8776;3.83 A cm&#8722;2 and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;2100, which are beyond the requirements for high&#8208;frequency identification tags. The P&#8208; to N&#8208;type polarity switching mechanism is proposed after spectroscopic and structural tests. Decent stability of the organic diode is obtained, which is due to the long channel length and low diffusion speed of the large size of dopants. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.

         <title>Cluster Fragments in Amorphous Phosphorus and their Evolution under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven simulations provide new insight into the structure of amorphous phosphorus. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings and more complex cluster fragments. The simulation results help to understand previous experimental observations at ambient and high pressure, and they provide an example of the emerging application of machine&#8208;learned potentials to complex functional materials.








Abstract
Amorphous phosphorus (a&#8208;P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a&#8208;P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here, it is shown that large&#8208;scale molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine&#8208;learning (ML)&#8208;based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a&#8208;P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings, as well as more complex seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium&#8208;range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. The work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a&#8208;P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML&#8208;driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one multifunctional Janus separator is prepared using interfacial engineering strategies to improve the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The reversibility of the Li&#8208;metal anode is greatly enhanced and the shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode is effectively suppressed. This work offers a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the metallic Li anode and the sulfur cathode in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208;dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of the anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains high&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus and high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen&#8208;group&#8208;grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), by which the formation of &#8220;hot spots&#8221; can be effectively avoid, the Li&#8208;ion flux homogenized, and dendrite growth suppressed. Meanwhile, at the interface between the separator and the cathode, the homogenously exposed single&#8208;atom Ru on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; polysulfides and reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of the Janus separator, a lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell using the Janus separator delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 310.2&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the Li anode and the sulfur cathode in LSBs.

         <title>Lattice Polarity Manipulation of Quasi&#8208;vdW Epitaxial GaN Films on Graphene Through Interface Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of the lattice polarity of quasi&#8208;vdW epitaxial GaN on graphene through controlling the interface atomic configuration is reported. This polarity&#8208;control rule is not affected by the growth method and is free of either crystalline or non&#8208;crystalline substrates. It makes the epitaxy of III&#8208;nitrides with preferred lattice polarity possible and improves the ability to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices.








Abstract
Quasi van der Waals epitaxy, a pioneering epitaxy of sp3&#8208;hybridized semiconductor films on sp2&#8208;hybridized 2D materials, provides a way, in principle, to achieve single&#8208;crystal epilayers with preferred atom configurations that are free of substrate. Unfortunately, this has not been experimentally confirmed in the case of the hexagonal semiconductor III&#8208;nitride epilayer until now. Here, it is reported that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity are achieved by forming C&#63743;O&#63743;N&#63743;Ga(3) or C&#63743;O&#63743;Ga&#63743;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&#63743;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen pre&#8208;irradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question of why those reported wurtzite III&#8208;nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layers grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8211;Mechanical Synergistic In Situ Multiscale Tissue Adhesion for Sustainable Residue&#8208;Free Bioelectronics Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic&#8211;mechanical, synergistic, in situ, multiscale tissue adhesion for various bioelectronic applications is demonstrated. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. Reliable real&#8208;time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are also successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity&#8208;assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long&#8208;term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, an electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue&#8208;free, sustainable, in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive is proposed. The model supports the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid&#8208;insensitive, sustainable, in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Atomic Fe&#8211;N4/C in Flexible Carbon Fiber Membrane as Binder&#8208;Free Air Cathode for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Stable Cycling over 1000 h</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon membrane with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C sites is constructed and used as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In virtue of the hierarchical porous structures and optimized local atomic configurations, the as&#8208;synthesized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free membrane as binder&#8208;free air cathode demonstrates a stable cycling over 1000 h for Zn&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free, durable, and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are vital for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The large specific surface area exposes a high concentration of Fe&#8211;N4/C sites embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. The as&#8208;synthesized Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86&#160;V/94.74&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) and most reported M&#8211;Nx/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid&#8208;state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 and long&#8208;term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid&#8208;state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Nucleation and Shaping of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling self&#8208;assembly is fundamentally challenging with implications for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Herein, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Light patterns enable positioning of composites in preassigned locations, sculpting of fine details and contours, and commanding the assembly of lines over millimeters with micrometer precision, hence combining the power of photolithography with self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlling self&#8208;assembly of nanocomposites is a fundamental challenge with exciting implications for next&#8208;generation advanced functional materials. Precursors for composites can be generated photochemically, but limited insight in the underlying processes has hindered precise hands&#8208;on guidance. In this study, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Carbonate is generated photochemically with UV light to steer the precipitation of nanocomposites of barium carbonate nanocrystals and amorphous silica (BaCO3/SiO2). Using a custom&#8208;built optical setup, the self&#8208;assembly process is controlled by optimizing the photogeneration, diffusion, reaction, and precipitation of the carbonate species, using the radius and intensity of the UV&#8208;light irradiated area and reaction temperature. Exploiting this control, nucleation is induced and the contours and individual features of the growing composite are sculpted according to micrometer&#8208;defined light patterns. Moreover, moving light patterns are exploited to create a constant carbonate concentration at the growth front to draw lines of nanocomposites with constant width over millimeters with micrometer precision. Light&#8208;directed generation of local gradients opens previously unimaginable opportunities for guiding self&#8208;assembly into functional materials.

A high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling potassium&#8208;ion battery is demonstrated, using a K2MnFe(CN)6 Prussian white cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode, and a concentrated electrolyte. This full cell delivers a high energy density of 260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and stable cycling over 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted wide interest for energy storage because of the abundance of the electrode materials involved; however, their electrochemical performances are far behind what can be achieved from lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) or sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, key promising electrode and electrolyte materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries are identified, the coupled electrochemical reactions in the cell are investigated, and the compatibility between different materials is demonstrated to play the most important role. K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode can deliver a high capacity of &#8776;125 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability over 61&#160;000 cycles (&#8776;9 months) if the side reactions from the anode can be prevented. Graphite is a good anode material but is subjected to degradation in traditional carbonate electrolytes. New concentrated electrolytes are developed and evaluated. A stable KIB system is demonstrated by coupling a stable K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode with a concentrated electrolyte to achieve a high energy density of &#8776;260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and good cycling of over 1000 cycles.

         <title>High Miscibility Compatible with Ordered Molecular Packing Enables an Excellent Efficiency of 16.2% in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>

Two novel small&#8208;molecule donors with thioalkyl chains in the para&#8208; (P&#8208;PhS) and the meta&#8208;position (M&#8208;PhS) are synthesized to regulate surface tension and molecular packing. An optimized morphology with small domains and ordered packing is simultanously obtained in the M&#8208;PhS:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, promoting a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.2% with excellent (FF&#160;&#215; Jsc) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs).








Abstract
In all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs), a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) usually needs a small phase separation, while a high fill factor (FF) is generally realized in a highly ordered packing system. However, small domain and ordered packing always conflicted each other in ASM&#8208;OSCs, leading to a mutually restricted Jsc and FF. In this study, alleviation of the previous dilemma by the strategy of obtaining simultaneous good miscibility and ordered packing through modulating homo&#8208; and heteromolecular interactions is proposed. By moving the alkyl&#8208;thiolation side chains from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208;position in the small&#8208;molecule donor, the surface tension and molecular planarity are synchronously enhanced, resulting in compatible properties of good miscibility with acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9 and strong self&#8208;assembly ability. As a result, an optimized morphology with multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale domains and highly ordered packing is realized. The device exhibits a long carrier lifetime (39.8 &#956;s) and fast charge collection (15.5&#160;ns). A record efficiency of 16.2% with a high FF of 75.6% and a Jsc of 25.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the ASM&#8208;OSCs is obtained. These results demonstrate that the strategy of simultaneously obtaining good miscibility with high crystallinity could be an efficient photovoltaic material design principle for high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Scalable Polyimide&#8208;Poly(Amic Acid) Copolymer Based Nanocomposites for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To develop scalable, high&#8208;temperature capacitors, polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymer&#8208;based nanocomposites with very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed. The outstanding energy density of &#8776;1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;96%&#160;is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C under 200 MV m&#8722;1 (working conditions in hybrid electric vehicles), &#8776;2.5 times higher than the room&#8208;temperature performance of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biaxially oriented polypropylene.








Abstract
The developments of next&#8208;generation electric power systems and electronics demand for high temperature (&#8776;150&#160;&#176;C), high energy density, high efficiency, scalable, and low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;based dielectric capacitors are still scarce. Here, the nanocomposites based on polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymers with a very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed and synthesized. Under the actual working condition in hybrid electric vehicles of 200 MV m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, a high energy density of 1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency higher than 96% is achieved. This is about 2.5 times higher than the room temperature energy density (&#8776;0.39 J cm&#8722;3 under 200 MV m&#8722;1) of the commercially used biaxially oriented polypropylene, the benchmark of dielectric polymer. Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#160;&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20&#160;000 cycles of charge&#8208;discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high&#8208;temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low&#8208;cost strategy to develop high&#8208;temperature polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

         <title>In Situ Architecting Endogenous Heterojunction of MoS2 Coupling with Mo2CTx MXenes for Optimized Li+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX is constructed in situ. The obtained hetero&#8208;Mo2C shows extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with reversible structural transformation. Moreover, the improved capability of electron and ion transport endows hetero&#8208;Mo2C electrode with superior lithium storage performance, which surpasses all reported Mo2C MXenes electrode materials.








Abstract
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications, which is impeded by complex synthesis method and finite MAX materials. Herein, an in situ hydrothermal strategy is implemented to successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx (hetero&#8208;Mo2C) directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure caused by the introduction of MoS2 endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with improved charge transport and lithium ion adsorption capabilities. As a result, hetero&#8208;Mo2C exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 1242 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and long cycle stability of 683.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycling. This work provides new insights into rational design of novel MXenes heterojunctions, practically important for the development of MXenes and their applications in high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

This work presents a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of an all&#8208;liquid microfluidic chip, significantly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel, and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization. All&#8208;liquid microfluidic enzymatic or cascade reactors are constructed, and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.








Abstract
Enzyme immobilization in the confines of microfluidic chips, that promote enzyme activity and stability, has become a powerful strategy to enhance biocatalysis and biomass conversion. Here, based on a newly developed all&#8208;liquid microfluidic chip, fabricated by the interfacial assembly of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) in a biphasic system, a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of a microchannel, greatly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization, is presented. Using horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase as model enzymes, all&#8208;liquid microfluidic enzymatic and cascade reactors have been constructed and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Nonfused Wide&#8208;Bandgap Acceptor for Versatile Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap nonfused nonfullerene acceptor named GS&#8208;ISO is designed and synthesized. GS&#8208;ISO exhibits a very flat molecular backbone and stable molecular conformation. Based on GS&#8208;ISO, outstanding power conversion efficiencies of over 19% (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for a tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell and over 28% (500&#160;lux, 2700&#160;K LED) for an indoor OPV cell are achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with nonfused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, NFAs named GS&#8208;OEH, GS&#8208;OC6, and GS&#8208;ISO, with optical bandgaps larger than 1.70&#160;eV, are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS&#8208;OEH and GS&#8208;OC6, GS&#8208;ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS&#8208;ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based cell with effective area of 1.0&#160;cm2&#160;exhibits a PCE of 28.37% under 2700&#160;K illumination of 500&#160;lux. A tandem OPV cell using PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO as the front subcell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based OPV cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing nonfused NFAs and also that GS&#8208;ISO is a promising WBG acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Photoconductivity Caused by Surface Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Stannates with Ultraviolet Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressure can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. Utilizing surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient, ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of the perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially&#160;confined and optically&#160;programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.








Abstract
Programmable optoelectronic devices call for the reversible control of the photocarrier recombination process by in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancies as a source of in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors have hampered the reversible formation of oxygen vacancies and their related phenomena. Here, a new strategy to manipulate the 2D photoconductivity from perovskite stannates is demonstrated by exploiting spatially&#160;selective photochemical reaction under ultraviolet illumination at room temperature. Remarkably, the ideal trap&#8208;free photocurrent of air&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;200&#160;pA) is reversibly switched into three orders of magnitude higher photocurrent of vacuum&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;335&#160;nA) with persistent photoconductivity depending on ambient oxygen pressure under illumination. Multiple characterizations elucidate that ultraviolet illumination of BaSnO3&#160;under low oxygen pressure induces surface oxygen vacancies as a result of surface photolysis combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient of BaSnO3; the concentrated oxygen vacancies are likely to induce a two&#8208;step transition of photocurrent response by changing the characteristics of in&#8208;gap states from the shallow level to the deep level. These results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8211;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#160;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Manipulating Electroluminochromism Behavior of Viologen&#8208;Substituted Iridium(III) Complexes through Ligand Engineering for Information Display and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes is designed to manipulate their electroluminochromism behavior. By attaching pyridiniums to the diimine or cyclometalating ligand and judiciously selecting the co&#8208;ligands, luminescence response to electrical stimuli is achieved in intensity, wavelength, and lifetime, which demonstrates anti&#8208;counterfeiting display through naked&#8208;eye detection, near&#8208;infrared camera, or time&#8208;resolved luminescence.








Abstract
Electrically controlling photoluminescence has attracted great research interest and offers many opportunities for technological developments. Electroluminochromic materials undergo redox reactions under low&#8208;voltage stimuli to achieve reversible luminescence switching. Till now, photoluminescence switching of a single molecule caused by electrical stimuli is restricted to intensity response because the redox&#8208;active moieties are good electron donors or acceptors and electrical stimuli can regulate the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer and affect the luminescence intensity. In this work, the manipulation of the electroluminochromism behavior of a series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes through the regulation of ligand orbital energy levels and electronic communication between the viologen pendants and the iridium(III) complex core is reported. Electrochemical redox reactions reversibly modulate either the luminescence quenching effect or the push&#8211;pull electronic effect of the viologen substituents, achieving multicolor &#8220;on&#8211;off&#8221; luminescence response toward electrical stimuli and luminescence manipulation between two emissive states with different wavelengths and lifetimes. To illustrate the promising applications of these electroluminochromic materials, recording and displaying luminescence information under electrical stimuli are demonstrated. Information encryption is realized by letting the electroluminochromism occur in the near&#8208;infrared region or in the time domain. Near&#8208;infrared camera or time&#8208;resolved luminescence analysis can be used to help read the invisible information.

Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8776; 60 &#181;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 is developed. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of the self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse are demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory. Potentially, the novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel Embodied with Macrophage&#8208;Regulation and Responsive&#8208;Gene&#8208;Silencing Properties for Synergistic Prevention of Peritendinous Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>

The MMP&#8208;2&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) loading guanidinobenzoic acid&#8208;modified generation 5 polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;GBA)/Smad3&#8208;small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticles (siRNA@MS) were fabricated by microfluidics technique, and then were incorporated into a self&#8208;healing hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel (siRNA@MS@HA) on the polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibers to form peritendinous anti&#8208;adhesion membrane. Here it is hypothesized that Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles would be released from GelMA MSs responded to the elevation of MMP&#8208;2 after tendon injury, thus downregulating the expression of Smad3 and fibroblast proliferation in peritendinous area. Moreover, the hydrogel&#8208;electrospun nanofibers could attenuate inflammation and act as a physical barrier to prevent adhesion tissue invading into the repaired tendon.








Abstract
Antiadhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self&#8208;healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel is constructed as a peritendinous antiadhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2)&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles are entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. GelMA MSs are responsively degraded by upregulation of MMP&#8208;2, achieving on&#8208;demand release of siRNA nanoparticles. Silencing effect of Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles is around 75% toward targeted gene. Furthermore, the self&#8208;healing hydrogel shows relatively attenuated inflammation compared to non&#8208;healing hydrogel. The mean adhesion scores of composite barrier group are 1.67 &#177; 0.51 and 2.17 &#177; 0.75 by macroscopic and histological evaluation, respectively. The proposed self&#8208;healing hydrogel antiadhesion barrier with MMP&#8208;2&#8208;responsive drug release behavior is highly effective for decreasing inflammation and inhibiting tendon adhesion. Therefore, this research provides a new strategy for the development of safe and effective antiadhesion barriers.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Polymerization of AIEgens for Light&#8208;Up Tumor Localization and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen&#8208;peptide conjugates (D2P1) and 3CBT that can undergo in situ polymerization to form aggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin B enzyme reactions, the peptide cleavage on D2P1 induces covalent polymerization between 3CBT, which triggers aggregation and accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal and tumor treatment efficacy.








Abstract
Improving the enrichment of drugs or theranostic agents within tumors is vital to achieve effective cancer diagnosis and therapy with reduced dosage and damage to normal tissues. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;mediated aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen (AIEgen) intracellular polymerization strategy that can simultaneously promote the accumulation and retention of the AIEgen in the tumor for prolonged imaging and enhanced tumor growth inhibition is described. An AIEgen&#8208;peptide conjugate (D2P1) and cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;cysteine (3CBT) that can undergo rapid condensation reaction to form nanoaggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light&#8208;up. Such enzyme&#8208;mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built&#8208;in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 can remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme&#8208;mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescence from Pillar&#8208;Layer MOFs by Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient (QYphos.&#160;= 80.6%), long&#8208;lived (169.7&#160;ms) blue phosphorescence has been achieved in pillar&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on the isolation and lock of ligand chromophores. The potential applications of these phosphors in 3D printing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and fingerprint visualization have been demonstrated owing to the excellent chemical and mechanical stability.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy&#8208;metal containing complexes and purely organic systems. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long&#8208;lived lifetimes. Taking the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a model, herein, a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization is proposed, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long&#8208;lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co&#8208;ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores&#8217; motions through coordination and host&#8208;guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with highly efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization have been also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

         <title>Tailored Double Emulsions Made Simple</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method is developed to produce double emulsions of a single core and a thin shell at a milliliter per minute production rate, requiring minimal instrumentation, cost, and expertise. This two&#8208;step emulsification technique offers control of shell thickness, diversity of liquid formulations, integration with microfluidic devices, and potential to scale&#8208;up.








Abstract
Double emulsions, such as water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplets, are important material platforms for conducting fundamental research and for technological applications. To date, well&#8208;defined double&#8208;emulsion droplets consisting of a single water core and a thin oil shell can be exclusively formed with sophisticated microfluidic devices. The fabrication, preparation, and operation of such devices is challenging, which reduces the availability of tailored double emulsions to a limited community of experts. Here, a simple method is introduced to produce single&#8208;core double emulsions with high yield in large quantities, using a vortex mixer. Utilizing the density difference between the dispersed droplet and the continuous phase, this two&#8208;step emulsification method can achieve very small core droplet diameters below 10 &#956;m and ultrathin shells with thicknesses below 1 &#956;m. A detailed picture of the formation mechanism is provided and it is demonstrated that the process can be extended to produce multishell and multicore emulsions.

&lt;p&gt;A simple method is developed to produce double emulsions of a single core and a thin shell at a milliliter per minute production rate, requiring minimal instrumentation, cost, and expertise. This two-step emulsification technique offers control of shell thickness, diversity of liquid formulations, integration with microfluidic devices, and potential to scale-up.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double emulsions, such as water-in-oil-in-water droplets, are important material platforms for conducting fundamental research and for technological applications. To date, well-defined double-emulsion droplets consisting of a single water core and a thin oil shell can be exclusively formed with sophisticated microfluidic devices. The fabrication, preparation, and operation of such devices is challenging, which reduces the availability of tailored double emulsions to a limited community of experts. Here, a simple method is introduced to produce single-core double emulsions with high yield in large quantities, using a vortex mixer. Utilizing the density difference between the dispersed droplet and the continuous phase, this two-step emulsification method can achieve very small core droplet diameters below 10 &#956;m and ultrathin shells with thicknesses below 1 &#956;m. A detailed picture of the formation mechanism is provided and it is demonstrated that the process can be extended to produce multishell and multicore emulsions. Finally, its application is demonstrated to produce structurally colored colloidal supraparticles with unprecedented uniformity and yield. The method allows the creation of tailored double emulsions with minimal time, cost, effort, and expertise, and may widen its application to nonspecialized scientific communities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted 4D Programming and Reprogramming of Liquid Crystalline Organogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropic approach is reported to program and reprogram the molecular ordering in liquid crystalline organogels via directed solvent evaporation. A wide variety of active origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of 3D printed LCNs with unattainable spatial and temporal control can be readily reached without meticulous alignment during network formation.








Abstract
Encoding molecular ordering during liquid crystalline network (LCN) formation endows preprogrammed but fixed shape morphing in response to external stimuli. The incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds enables shape reprogramming but also permanently alters the network structures. Here, an entropic approach that can program complex shapes via directed solvent evaporation from an isotropic LCN organogel is discoursed. Different shapes can be erased and reprogrammed from the same LCN on demand depending on the modes of deformation of the organogel during solvent evaporation. The ability to decouple network synthesis and molecular alignment relaxes the requirements to LCN chemistry and alignment methods, allowing for the realization of a variety of origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of LCNs printed from the digital light processing technique with unattainable spatial and temporal controls.

         <title>Strong Metal Phosphide&#8211;Phosphate Support Interaction for Enhanced Non&#8208;Noble Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for heterogeneous catalysis but limited by reducible oxide supports and the activity and stability contradiction. A new strong metal phosphide&#8211;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI) induced by P activation is reported for the non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with superior hydrogenation activity, stability, anti&#8208;oxidant and anti&#8208;acid capacity.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for supported catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Here is the first report on strong metal phosphide&#8208;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI). The key to SMPSI is the activation of P species on the support, which leads to simultaneous generation of metal phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) and core&#8211;shell nanostructures formed by support migration onto the NPs. The encapsulation state of metal phosphide and charge transfer are identical to those of classical SMSIs and can be optimally regulated. Furthermore, the strong interactions of Co2PL/MnP&#8208;3 not only significantly enhance the anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;acid capability of non&#8208;noble metal but also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability toward hydrogenating a wide range of compounds into value&#8208;added fine chemicals with 100% selectivity, which is even better than Pd/C and Pt/C. The SMPSI construction can be generally extended to other systems such as Ni2PL/Mn3(PO4)2, Co2PL/LaPO4, and CoPL/CePO4. This study provides a new approach for the rational design of advanced non&#8208;noble metal catalysts and introduce a novel paradigm for the strong interaction between NPs and support.

         <title>Toward Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens&#8217; Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces based on disordered arrangements of silicon nanoresonators are used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective optical diffusers with nearly Lambertian scattering profiles and a high tolerance for incidence angles and polarizations. Their working principles and scattering performances are discussed on the basis of exhaustive experimental and numerical studies. Such diffusers open new opportunities in applications like fluorescence microscopy, augmented reality displays, or wavefront&#8208;shaping.








Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. This work explores how dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces can implement wavelength&#8208;selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. The combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is shown to be an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. The proposed metasurfaces&#8217; directional scattering performance is characterized both experimentally and numerically, and their usability in wavefront&#8208;shaping applications is highlighted. Since the metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality displays.

         <title>Cell Sheet&#8208;Like Soft Nanoreactor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#160;nm&#8208;thick soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays are designed to confine and guide the inward crystallization of nanocrystals. Such cell&#8208;like soft nanoreactor sheets change the reaction kinetics and offer a general platform to synthesize a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures that are difficult to achieve using traditional bulk solution&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
Tissues, which consist of groups of closely packed cell arrays, are essentially sheet&#8208;like biosynthesis plants. In tissues, individual cells are discrete microreactors working under highly viscous and confined environments. Herein, soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays, as analogous nanoscale &#8220;sheet&#8208;like chemosynthesis plants&#8221;, for the controlled synthesis of novel nanocrystals, are reported. Although the soft polystyrene (PS) is only 3&#160;nm thick, it is elastic, robust, and permeable to aqueous solutes, while significantly slowing down their diffusion. PEN&#8208;associated palladium (Pd) crystallization follows a diffusion&#8208;controlled zero&#8208;order kinetics rather than a reaction&#8208;controlled first&#8208;order kinetics in bulk solution. Each individual PEN reactor has a volume in the zeptoliter range, which offers a unique confined environment, enabling a directional inward crystallization, in contrast to the conventional outward nucleation/growth that occurs in an unconfined bulk solution. This strategy makes it possible to generate a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures, which are difficult to achieve with normal systems based on bulk solutions.

         <title>Electronically and Geometrically Modified Single&#8208;Atom Fe Sites by Adjacent Fe Nanoparticles for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlations between electronic and geometric structures of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance are investigated by varying the secondary heat&#8208;treatment of a NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst. The adjacent Fe nanoparticles can regulate the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites, reducing energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials exhibit excellent activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most promising candidates to replace commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, it is challenging to unravel features of the superior ORR activity originating from Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials. In this work, the electronic and geometric structures of the isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their correlations with the ORR performance are investigated by varying the secondary thermal activation temperature of a rationally designed NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC). The systematic analyses demonstrate the significant role of coordinated atoms of SA and metallic Fe nanoparticles (NPs) in altering the electronic structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Meanwhile, strong interaction between isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and adjacent Fe NPs can change the geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that optimal regulation of the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites by the co&#8208;existence of Fe NPs narrows the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance. This work not only provides the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationship, but also sheds light on designing efficient Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging at 1550&#160;nm Boosts Orthotopic Glioblastoma Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of nanofluorophores is a promising approach for theranostic of orthotopic glioma. Brain&#8208;targeting nanofluorophores featuring novel molecular design of &#8220;backbone distortion + molecular rotor&#8221; are prepared. They can balance the photon energy flow to achieve advanced NIR&#8208;II imaging at 1550&#160;nm and photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat ratio for PTT in orthotopic&#8208;glioma&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
A remaining challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surmounting the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Such a challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) nanoparticles are developed via rational design, which involves twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation&#8208;mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550&#160;nm and non&#8208;radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR&#8208;PTT). The brain&#8208;targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550&#160;nm band&#8208;pass filter is utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of the nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcomes previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that the ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Collectively, the work highlights the smart design of a brain&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE theranostic approach that opens new diagnosis and treatment options in the photonic therapy of GBM.

Hetero&#8208;MXenes
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications. In article number 2108809, Li Song and co&#8208;workers successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX via an optimal in situ hydrothermal strategy. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and an optimized Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, with improved charge transport and Li+&#8208;adsorption capabilities.

Single&#8208;Core Double Emulsions
The fabrication of single&#8208;core double emulsions typically requires sophisticated microfluidic devices and meticulous operation protocols. In article number 2107338, Nicolas Vogel and co&#8208;workers develop a convenient method to produce such tailored double emulsions with defined droplet structure using only vortex mixing. This fast, low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;yield method improves the accessibility of droplet&#8208;based materials.

2D Photoconductivity
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressures can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. In article number 2107650, utilizing a surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction, Junwoo Son and co&#8208;workers report that ultraviolet&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of a perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially confined and optically programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.

         <title>Advanced Multifunctional Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries Design: From Materials and Devices to Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) can provide additional functions to realize unprecedented applications where conventional batteries normally fail. This review describes the recent advances of MARBs in terms of materials engineering, device design, system integration, and applications. The challenges and opportunities for further developments in the emerging field of MARBs are deeply discussed.








Abstract
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) are regarded as safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable electrochemical energy storage devices, which offer additional functionalities that conventional batteries cannot achieve, which ideally leads to unprecedented applications. Although MARBs are among the most exciting and rapidly growing topics in scientific research and industrial development nowadays, a systematic summary of the evolution and advances in the field of MARBs is still not available. Therefore, the review presented comprehensively and systematically summarizes the design principles and the recent advances of MARBs by categories of smart ARBs and integrated systems, together with an analysis of their device design and configuration, electrochemical performance, and diverse smart functions. The two most promising strategies to construct novel MARBs may be A) the introduction of functional materials into ARB components, and B) integration of ARBs with other functional devices. The ongoing challenges and future perspectives in this research and development field are outlined to foster the future development of MARBs. Finally, the most important upcoming research directions in this rapidly developing field are highlighted that may be most promising to lead to the commercialization of MARBs and to a further broadening of their range of applications.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Supported Atomically Dispersed Metals as Bifunctional Catalysts for Next&#8208;Generation Batteries Based on Conversion Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
This review analyzes the key factors that hinder the reversible conversion of conversion&#8208;type materials, provides a fundamental understanding of graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs), and provides guidance on the bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs to be used in high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation batteries, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G&#8208;ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G&#8208;ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion&#8208;type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMC materials for next&#8208;generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.

         <title>A Logic&#8208;Based Diagnostic and Therapeutic Hydrogel with Multistimuli Responsiveness to Orchestrate Diabetic Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel responsive to diabetic microenvironmental cues combined with the controlled delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory and osteogenic protein drugs. The logic&#8208;based drug release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects.








Abstract
The regeneration of diabetic bone defects remains challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by glucose fluctuation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and overexpression of proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual&#8208;logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel consisting of phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and gelatin colloids. It exhibits a &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; logic to interpret pathological cues (glucose fluctuation, ROS, MMPs) and determines when to release drug in a diabetic microenvironment and a therapeutic logic to program different cargo release to match immune&#8208;osteo cascade for better tissue regeneration. The hydrogel is also shown to be mechanically adaptable to the local complexity at the bone defect. Furthermore, the underlying therapeutic mechanism is elucidated, whereby the logic&#8208;based cargo release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects. This study provides critical insight into the design and biological mechanism of dual&#8208;logic&#8208;based tissue&#8208;engineering strategies for diabetic bone regeneration.

         <title>Nanophotonic Materials for Twisted&#8208;Light Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted light, an unbounded set of helical spatial modes of electromagnetic light fields, offers both fundamental new insights into structured light&#8211;matter interactions and a new degree of freedom to boost optical and quantum information capacity. Recently, the nanophotonics field has transformed the photonic design and unveiled a diverse range of compact and multifunctional nanophotonic materials and devices for twisted&#8208;light manipulation.








Abstract
Twisted light, an unbounded set of helical spatial modes carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), offers not only fundamental new insights into structured light&#8211;matter interactions, but also a new degree of freedom to boost optical and quantum information capacity. However, current OAM experiments still rely on bulky, expensive, and slow&#8208;response diffractive or refractive optical elements, hindering today's OAM systems to be largely deployed. In the last decade, nanophotonics has transformed the photonic design and unveiled a diverse range of compact and multifunctional nanophotonic devices harnessing the generation and detection of OAM modes. Recent metasurface devices developed for OAM generation in both real and momentum space, presenting design principle and exemplary devices, are summarized. Moreover, recent development of whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode&#8208;based passive and tunable microcavities, capable of extracting degenerate OAM modes for on&#8208;chip vortex emission and lasing, is summarized. In addition, the design principle of different plasmonic devices and photodetectors recently developed for on&#8208;chip OAM detection is discussed. Current challenges faced by the nanophotonic field for twisted&#8208;light manipulation and future advances to meet these challenges are further discussed. It is believed that twisted&#8208;light manipulation in nanophotonics will continue to make significant impact on future development of ultracompact, ultrahigh&#8208;capacity, and ultrahigh&#8208;speed OAM systems&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>Understanding Nanomaterial&#8211;Liver Interactions to Facilitate the Development of Safer Nanoapplications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread exposure of nanomaterials to the body and gaining access to systemic circulation lead to nanomaterial liver accumulation. This induces cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses to NMs with various physicochemical properties. Understanding nano&#8208;liver interactions helps to develop safer nanoproducts and more effective nanomedicine.








Abstract
Nanomaterials (NMs) are widely used in commercial and medical products, such as cosmetics, vaccines, and drug carriers. Exposure to NMs via various routes such as dermal, inhalation, and ingestion has been shown to gain access to the systemic circulation, resulting in the accumulation of NMs in the liver. The unique organ structures and blood flow features facilitate the liver sequestration of NMs, which may cause adverse effects in the liver. Currently, most in vivo studies are focused on NMs accumulation at the organ level and evaluation of the gross changes in liver structure and functions, however, cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses, as well as the molecular mechanisms at cellular levels leading to effects at organ levels are lagging. Herein, the authors systematically review diverse interactions of NMs with the liver, specifically on major liver cell types including Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes as well as the detailed molecular mechanisms involved. In addition, the knowledge gained on nano&#8208;liver interactions that can facilitate the development of safer nanoproducts and nanomedicine is also reviewed.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Wide&#8208;Gamut Coloration at the Diffraction Limit in Flexible, Self&#8208;Assembled Hierarchical Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric structural coloration platform that simultaneously addresses all areas required for real&#8208;world commercial applications is implemented: wide colors gamut, also exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum, low manufacturing costs, large&#8208;scale printing demonstrated on entire wafers and 4 in. flexible substrates, and high printing resolutions at a constant 101&#8201;600 dots per inch.








Abstract
Unveiling physical phenomena that generate controllable structural coloration is at the center of significant research efforts due to the platform potential for the next generation of printing, sensing, displays, wearable optoelectronics components, and smart fabrics. Colors based on e&#8208;beam facilities possess high resolutions above 100k dots per inch (DPI), but limit manufacturing scales up to 4.37&#160;cm2, while requiring rigid substrates that are not flexible. State&#8208;of&#8208;art scalable techniques, on the contrary, provide either narrow gamuts or small resolutions. A common issue of current methods is also a heterogeneous resolution, which typically changes with the color printed. Here, a structural coloration platform with broad gamuts exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum in inexpensive, thermally resistant, flexible, and metallic&#8208;free structures at constant 101&#8201;600&#160;DPI (at the diffraction limit), obtained via mass&#8208;production manufacturing is demonstrated. This platform exploits a previously unexplored physical mechanism, which leverages the interplay between strong scattering modes and optical resonances excited in fully 3D dielectric nanostructures with suitably engineered longitudinal profiles. The colors obtained with this technology are scalable to any area, demonstrated up to the single wafer (4 in.). These results open real&#8208;world applications of inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution, large&#8208;scale structural colors with broad chromatic spectra.

         <title>Unraveling Crystallization Mechanisms and Electronic Structure of Phase&#8208;Change Materials by Large&#8208;Scale Ab Initio Simulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization mechanism of GeSb2Te4 is described via ab initio computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1000 atoms. The smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel is utilized to reveal the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order during crystallization. The connection between structural and electronic properties of the recrystallized models is studied.








Abstract
Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te (&#8220;GST&#8221;) alloys are leading phase&#8208;change materials for digital memories and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon fast crystallization, these materials form rocksalt&#8208;like phases with large structural and vacancy disorder, leading to an insulating phase at low temperature. Here, a comprehensive description of crystallization, structural disorder, and electronic properties of GeSb2Te4 based on realistic, quantum&#8208;mechanically based (&#8220;ab initio&#8221;) computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1000 atoms is provided. It is shown how an analysis of the crystallization mechanism based on the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel reveals the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order. The connection between structural and electronic properties of the disordered, as&#8208;crystallized models, which are relevant to the transport properties of GST, is then studied. Furthermore, it is shown how antisite defects and extended Sb&#8208;rich motifs can lead to Anderson localization in the conduction band. Beyond memory applications, these findings are therefore more generally relevant to disordered rocksalt&#8208;like chalcogenides that exhibit self&#8208;doping, since they can explain the origin of Anderson insulating behavior in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;doped chalcogenide materials.

         <title>Bioinks and Bioprinting Strategies for Skeletal Muscle Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benefits of 3D bioprinting technologies for skeletal muscle tissue engineering are highlighted. Skeletal muscle physiology, muscle regeneration following injury, and current treatments are discussed. Subsequently, bioprinting strategies implemented for muscle tissue engineering are critically reviewed. Recent advances in bioinks and bioprinting strategies to construct large tissues, boost myogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and enhance integration are discussed.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles play important roles in critical body functions and their injury or disease can lead to limitation of mobility and loss of independence. Current treatments result in variable functional recovery, while reconstructive surgery, as the gold&#8208;standard approach, is limited due to donor shortage, donor&#8208;site morbidity, and limited functional recovery. Skeletal muscle tissue engineering (SMTE) has generated enthusiasm as an alternative solution for treatment of injured tissue and serves as a functional disease model. Recently, bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for recapitulating the complex and highly organized architecture of skeletal muscles at clinically relevant sizes. Here, skeletal muscle physiology, muscle regeneration following injury, and current treatments following muscle loss are discussed, and then bioprinting strategies implemented for SMTE are critically reviewed. Subsequently, recent advancements that have led to improvement of bioprinting strategies to construct large muscle structures, boost myogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and enhance tissue integration are discussed. Bioinks for muscle bioprinting, as an essential part of any bioprinting strategy, are discussed, and their benefits, limitations, and areas to be improved are highlighted. Finally, the directions the field should expand to make bioprinting strategies more translational and overcome the clinical unmet needs are discussed.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Confined Printing of Programmable Organic Microcrystal Assemblies for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable organic microcrystal assemblies with dynamic tunable shapes and orientations are manufactured using a virtual, dynamic, noncontact template created by magnetic domain confined printing method. The highly reproducible shape switching enables it to be encoded into a multilevel QR code that encrypts, decrypts, and erases security information by applying a magnetic field.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale assembly of organic micro/nanocrystals into well&#8208;defined patterns with programmable structures is essential for applications such as information encryption at both high data density and high security level. Here, a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted approach that produces programmable assemblies of organic microcrystals with various shapes and orientations, using the magnetic domains of the underlying ferromagnetic metal microarrays as the printing templates, is developed. The diamagnetic microcrystals tend to aggregate in the regions of minimal field strength, and thus their assembly behavior is precisely controlled by the local field distribution on top of magnetic domains on substrate. The dynamic assembly process of microcrystal assemblies can be programmed upon the sequence of applied field, and their shape changes are &#8776;100% reproducible on a large scale (&gt;20&#8201;000 sites over 1 cm2). These features of magnetically programmable assemblies are ideally suited for information encryption, for which the encryption&#8211;decryption&#8211;erasing of multilevel information from a QR&#8208;code pattern based on the microcrystal assemblies under magnetic field is demonstrated.

         <title>Boosting Continuous&#8208;Wave Laser&#8208;Driven Nonlinear Photothermal White Light Generation by Nanoscale Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;laser&#8208;driven white light emission intensity can be enhanced up to 100 folds by introducing nanoscale porosity to a silica medium doped with rare&#8208;earth ions. The process involves strong nonlinear photothermal emission, and it is promising to be used as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing.








Abstract
The irradiation of an optically absorptive medium by a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser can result in a spectral continuum emission covering both the visible and NIR regions, which is attractive for applications as continuum light sources in diverse fields. It is shown here that this NIR&#8208;laser&#8208;driven light emission can be effectively modulated with nanoscale architecture in the medium. By using porous silica as the model matrix and Yb3+ ions as the photothermally active centers, up to 100 folds increment in NIR&#8208;laser&#8208;induced emission intensity and dramatic decrease in threshold excitation density are demonstrated. It is observed that the emission intensity exhibits a strong nonlinear dependence on the power of the NIR excitation laser, featuring clear excitation power thresholds. Based on combined numerical simulation and spectral and temperature measurements, the improved broadband emission and photothermal nonlinearity are interpreted by enhanced optical energy localization around the laser spot that results in boosting the photon&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion efficiency. The use of the nonlinear photothermal emission process as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing, is further demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.

         <title>Tough, Transparent, 3D&#8208;Printable, and Self&#8208;Healing Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;Gel (PEGgel)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient solvent strategy is proposed to enhance and refine the performance of polymer gel with a large range via using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent. Due to this unique solvent system, the obtained gel exhibits long&#8208;lasting performance (&gt;1 month), high stretchability (6000%), rapid self&#8208;healing (1&#160;min), suitable for self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuators.








Abstract
Polymer gels, such as hydrogels, have been widely used in biomedical applications, flexible electronics, and soft machines. Polymer network design and its contribution to the performance of gels has been extensively studied. In this study, the critical influence of the solvent nature on the mechanical properties and performance of soft polymer gels is demonstrated. A polymer gel platform based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent is reported (PEGgel). Compared to the corresponding hydrogel or ethylene glycol gel, the PEGgel with physically cross&#8208;linked poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) demonstrates high stretchability and toughness, rapid self&#8208;healing, and long&#8208;term stability. Depending on the molecular weight and fraction of PEG, the tensile strength of the PEGgels varies from 0.22 to 41.3 MPa, fracture strain from 12% to 4336%, modulus from 0.08 to 352 MPa, and toughness from 2.89 to 56.23 MJ m&#8211;3. Finally, rapid self&#8208;healing of the PEGgel is demonstrated and a self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuator is fabricated by 3D&#8208;printing. The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system may be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross&#8208;linked). Such a simple 3D&#8208;printable, self&#8208;healing, and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.

         <dc:description>
The authors create the photonic&#8208;crystal&#8208;directed molecular design platform through covalent gridization of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers. Via solvent&#8208;casting method, conjugated nanopolymers perform the in situ mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into 1D photonic crystals with multilayer microstructures. These photonic crystals show a high mechanical toughness, a high optical transmittance, an angle&#8208;dependent photoluminescence switching, and an ultralow waveguide loss, potential for bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Organic semiconducting emitters integrated with butterfly&#8208;mimetic photonic crystals (PhCs) are fascinating for dramatic advantages over light outcoupling efficiency and multifunctional strain sensors, as well as the key step toward electrically pumped lasers. Herein, an unprecedentedly direct mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into 1D PhCs is reported through a covalently gridization&#8208;driven approach of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers. A simple solvent&#8208;casting procedure allows for in situ self&#8208;assembly of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated nanopolymer, poly{[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]grid}&#8208;co&#8208;{[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]grid} (PODPFG), into well&#8208;defined multilayer architectures with an excellent toughness (30&#8211;40 J m&#8211;3). This ordered meso&#8208;architecture shows a typical Bragg&#8211;Snell diffraction behavior to testify the PhC nature, along with a high effective refractive index (1.80&#8211;1.88) and optical transmittance (85&#8211;87%). The PhC films also exhibit an angle&#8208;dependent blue/green photoluminescence switching, an electroluminescence efficiency enhancement by 150&#8211;250%, and an amplified spontaneous emission enhancement with ultralow waveguide loss coefficient (2.60 cm&#8211;1). Gridization of organic semiconductors offers promising opportunities for cross&#8208;scale morphology&#8208;directed molecular design in multifunctional organic mechatronics and intelligences.

         <title>Tunable Nanoscale Evolution and Topological Phase Transitions of a Polar Vortex Supercrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical simulation and X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that the stability and nanoscale evolution of the polar vortex supercrystal with 3D periodicity in the PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice under optical, thermal, and electrical stimuli, which includes the erase process of the supercrystal, the new stripe supercrystal, as well as the vortex&#8211;skyrmion topological phase transition.








Abstract
Understanding the phase transitions and domain evolutions of mesoscale topological structures in ferroic materials is critical to realizing their potential applications in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance storage devices. Here, the behaviors of a mesoscale supercrystal are studied with 3D nanoscale periodicity and rotational topology phases in a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 (PTO/STO) superlattice under thermal and electrical stimuli using a combination of phase&#8208;field simulations and X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. A phase diagram of temperature versus polar state is constructed, showing the formation of the supercrystal from a mixed vortex and a&#8208;twin state and a temperature&#8208;dependent erasing process of a supercrystal returning to a classical a&#8208;twin structure. Under an in&#8208;plane electric field bias at room temperature, the vortex topology of the supercrystal irreversibly transforms to a new type of stripe&#8208;like supercrystal. Under an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the vortices inside the supercrystal undergo a topological phase transition to polar skyrmions. These results demonstrate the potential for the on&#8208;demand manipulation of polar topology and transformations in supercrystals using electric fields. The findings provide a theoretical understanding that may be utilized to guide the design and control of mesoscale polar structures and to explore novel polar structures in other systems and their topological nature.

These results demonstrate the potential for the on-demand manipulation of polar topology and transformations in supercrystals using electric fields. The findings provide a theoretical understanding that may be utilized to guide the design and control of mesoscale polar structures and to explore novel polar structures in other systems and their topological nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions in a Thickness Tunable 2D Ferromagnet from a Defect Driven Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of skyrmions in 2D materials has opened a door to novel tunability of their magnetic structure. Here, it is shown that the chiral N&#233;el skyrmions are stabilized in the metallic 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, as a result of breaking of the inversion symmetry of its crystal structure that is derived from an asymmetric distribution of Fe atoms in alternate layers in the compound. It is found that the skyrmion size in this compound is strongly influenced by the sample thickness and changes from &#8776;100 to &#8776;700&#160;nm as the sample thickness is increased from &#8776;90&#160;nm to &#8776;2 &#181;m.








Abstract
There is considerable interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials as potential hosts for chiral skyrmionic spin textures. Of particular interest is the ferromagnetic, metallic compound Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), which has a comparatively high Curie temperature (150&#8211;220 K). Several recent studies have reported the observation of chiral N&#233;el skyrmions in this compound, which is inconsistent with its presumed centrosymmetric structure. Here the observation of N&#233;el type skyrmions in single crystals of FGT via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) is reported. It is shown from detailed X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis that FGT lacks an inversion symmetry as a result of an asymmetric distribution of Fe vacancies. This vacancy&#8208;induced breaking of the inversion symmetry of this compound is a surprising and novel observation and is a prerequisite for a Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya vector exchange interaction which accounts for the chiral N&#233;el skyrmion phase. This phenomenon is likely to be common to many 2D vdW materials and suggests a path to the preparation of many such acentric compounds. Furthermore, it is found that the skyrmion size in FGT is strongly dependent on its thickness: the skyrmion size increases from &#8776;100 to &#8776;750&#160;nm as the thickness of the lamella is increased from &#8776;90&#160;nm to &#8776;2&#160;&#181;m. This extreme size tunability is a feature common to many low symmetry ferro&#8208; and ferri&#8208;magnetic compounds.

         <title>P&#8208;Doped NiTe2 with Te&#8208;Vacancies in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries Prevents Shuttling and Promotes Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doped NiTe2 electrocatalysts with Te&#8208;vacancies are fabricated on maize&#8208;straw carbon nanosheets to act as separators in Li&#8211;S batteries. They exhibit high conductivities and strong polysulfide adsorption, which increase redox conversions and sulfur electrochemistry.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish polysulfide conversion kinetics. Here, a P&#8208;doped nickel tellurium electrocatalyst with Te&#8208;vacancies (P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x) anchored on maize&#8208;straw carbon (MSC) nanosheets, served as a functional layer (MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x) on the separator of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. The P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x electrocatalyst enhanced the intrinsic conductivity, strengthened the chemical affinity for polysulfides, and accelerated sulfur redox conversion. The MSC nanosheets enabled NiTe2 nanoparticle dispersion and Li+ diffusion. In situ Raman and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra confirmed that the MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x restrained the shuttle effect and accelerated the redox conversion. The MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x&#8208;based cell has a cyclability of 637 mAh g&#8208;1 at 4 C over 1800 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.0139% per cycle, high rate performance of 726 mAh g&#8208;1 at 6 C, and a high areal capacity of 8.47 mAh cm&#8208;2 under a sulfur configuration of 10.2&#160;mg cm&#8208;2, and a low electrolyte/sulfur usage ratio of 3.9. This work demonstrates that vacancy&#8208;induced doping of heterogeneous atoms enables durable sulfur electrochemistry and can impact future electrocatalytic designs related to various energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Electronegativity&#8208;Induced Charge Balancing to Boost Stability and Activity of Amorphous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability of amorphous MoSxOy via a charge&#8208;balancing strategy is reported. Co&#8208;doping of Rh and Sn with different electronegativities induces local charge redistribution, which shifts the H attacking site and HER&#8208;active sites. As a result, the co&#8208;doped amorphous catalysts outperform undoped and single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped MoSxOy.








Abstract
Amorphization is an efficient strategy to activate intrinsically inert catalysts. However, the low crystallinity of amorphous catalysts often causes high solubility and poor electrochemical stability in aqueous solution. Here, a different mechanism is developed to simultaneously stabilize and activate the water&#8208;soluble amorphous MoSxOy via a charge&#8208;balancing strategy, which is induced by different electronegativity between the co&#8208;dopants Rh (2.28) and Sn (1.96). The electron&#8208;rich Sn prefers to stabilize the unstable apical O sites in MoSxOy through charge transfer, which can prevent the H from attacking. Meanwhile, the Rh, as the charge regulator, shifts the main active sites on the basal plane from inert Sn to active apical Rh sites. As a result, the amorphous RhSn&#8208;MoSxOy exhibits drastic enhancement in electrochemical stability (&#951;10 increases only by 12&#160;mV) after 1000 cycles and a distinct activity (&#951;10: 26&#160;mV and Tafel: 30.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic solution. This work paves a route for turning impracticably water&#8208;soluble catalysts into treasure and inspires new ideas to design high&#8208;performance amorphous electrocatalysts.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Flux Nanoporous Graphene Membrane for Sustainable Seawater Desalination using Low&#8208;Grade Heat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin nanoporous graphene membrane is developed, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The fabrication process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes generally required for graphene membranes. In direct&#8208;contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature gradient, the membrane shows outstanding performance and holds great potential for water desalination toward a low&#8208;carbon future.








Abstract
Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development of sustainable desalination and zero&#8208;discharge processes because of its possibility of recovering 100% water and the potential for integration with low&#8208;grade heat, such as solar energy. However, the conventional membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing its practical application. Here, ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes are reported by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top edges of a highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the direct&#8208;contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair of 65/25&#160;&#176;C,&#160;the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average water flux of 421.7 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with over 99.8% salt rejection, which is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes. The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using water from the Red Sea heated under direct sunlight radiation show that the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from 8 am to 8 pm, showing a great potential for real applications in seawater desalination.

&lt;p&gt;An ultrathin nanoporous graphene membrane is developed, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The fabrication process avoids the challenging pore-generation and substrate-transfer processes generally required for graphene membranes. In direct-contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature gradient, the membrane shows outstanding performance and holds great potential for water desalination toward a low-carbon future.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development of sustainable desalination and zero-discharge processes because of its possibility of recovering 100% water and the potential for integration with low-grade heat, such as solar energy. However, the conventional membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing its practical application. Here, ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes are reported by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top edges of a highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The process avoids the challenging pore-generation and substrate-transfer processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the direct-contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair of 65/25&#160;&#176;C,&#160;the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average water flux of 421.7 L m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with over 99.8% salt rejection, which is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes. The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using water from the Red Sea heated under direct sunlight radiation show that the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 L m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from 8 am to 8 pm, showing a great potential for real applications in seawater desalination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene on Chromia: A System for Beyond&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust spin&#8208;dependent transport is demonstrated well beyond room temperature in heterostructures of graphene and the antiferromagnetic oxide chromia. The spin&#8208;dependent transport is attributed to the symmetry&#8208;breaking action of chromia, and persists at zero magnetic field and despite the absence of any ferromagnetic elements in the devices. These results represent an important advance for practical spintronics based on graphene.








Abstract
Evidence of robust spin&#8208;dependent transport in monolayer graphene, deposited on the (0001) surface of the antiferromagnetic (AFM)/magneto&#8208;electric oxide chromia (Cr2O3), is provided. Measurements performed in the non&#8208;local spin&#8208;Hall geometry reveal a robust signal that is present at zero external magnetic field and which is significantly larger than any possible ohmic contribution. The spin&#8208;related signal persists well beyond the N&#233;el temperature (&#8776;307 K) that defines the transition between the AFM and paramagnetic states, remaining visible at the highest studied temperature of close to 450 K. This robust character is consistent with prior theoretical studies of the graphene/Cr2O3 system, predicting that the lifting of sub&#8208;lattice symmetry in the graphene shall induce an effective spin&#8211;orbit term of &#8776;40 meV. Overall, the results indicate that graphene&#8208;on&#8208;chromia heterostructures are a highly promising framework for the implementation of spintronic devices, capable of operation well beyond room temperature.

Abstract
Impossible voltage plateau regulation for the cathode materials with fixed active elemental center is a pressing issue hindering the development of Na&#8208;super&#8208;ionic conductor (NASICON) type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we pioneeringly utilize high&#8208;entropy substitution strategy, to alter detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing central active V atom, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. As&#8208;prepared carbon&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE&#8208;NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81&#160;V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1, which is attributed by the diverse transition metal elemental substitution in high&#8208;entropy crystalline. More importantly, high&#8208;entropy introducing can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low&#8208;voltage region, further lifting up mean working voltage to realize a full Na ions storage at high voltage plateau. Coupling with hard carbon (HC) anode, HE&#8208;NVPF//HC SIBs full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 at 5C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg&#8211;1. This route let the unlikely potential regulation in NASICON&#8208;type crystal with unchangeable active center becomes possible, inspiring new ideas on elevating mean working voltage for SIBs cathodes.

         <title>Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Enables Tuning of Nanopores in Atomically Thin Graphene Membranes for Highly Selective Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membranes with precise pore size distributions are needed for efficient and selective separations for a sustainable future. Self&#8208;assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes across nanopores in atomically thin graphene membranes is shown to enable controllable size&#8208;dependent sealing of nanopores to tighten their size distribution and attenuate leakage. The enhanced membrane selectivity, without compromising water permeance, allows for desalination under forward osmosis.








Abstract
Atomically thin membranes comprising nanopores in a 2D material promise to surpass the performance of polymeric membranes in several critical applications, including water purification, chemical and gas separations, and energy harvesting. However, fabrication of membranes with precise pore size distributions that provide exceptionally high selectivity and permeance in a scalable framework remains an outstanding challenge. Circumventing these constraints, here, a platform technology is developed that harnesses the ability of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to self&#8208;assemble preferentially across larger, relatively leaky atomically thin nanopores by exploiting the lower steric hindrance of such larger pores to molecular interactions across the pores. By selectively tightening the pore size distribution in this manner, self&#8208;assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes simultaneously introduced on opposite sides of nanoporous graphene membranes is demonstrated to discriminate between nanopores to seal non&#8208;selective transport channels, while minimally compromising smaller, water&#8208;selective pores, thereby remarkably attenuating solute leakage. This improved membrane selectivity enables desalination across centimeter&#8208;scale nanoporous graphene with 99.7% and &gt;90%&#160;rejection of MgSO4 and NaCl, respectively, under forward osmosis. These findings provide a versatile strategy to augment the performance of nanoporous atomically thin membranes and present intriguing possibilities of controlling reactions across 2D materials via exclusive exploitation of pore size&#8208;dependent intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Alternate Storage of Opposite Charges in Multisite for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Al&#8210;MOF Battery</title>

Abstract
The limited active sites of cathode materials in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) restrict the storage of more large&#8208;sized Al&#8208;complex ions, leading to a low celling of theoretical capacity. To make the utmost of active sites, we herein propose an alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges (AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations) in multisites to achieve an ultrahigh capacity in Al&#8210;MOF battery. The bipolar ligands (oxidized from 18&#960; to 16&#960; electrons and reduced from 18&#960; to 20&#960; electrons in a planar cyclic conjugated system) can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which can double the capacity of unipolar ligands. Moreover, the high&#8208;density active Cu sites (Cu nodes) in 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF could also store AlCl2+ cations for a higher capacity. The rigid and extended MOF structure can address the problems of high solubility and poor stability of small organic molecules. As a result, three&#8208;step redox reactions with two&#8208;electron transfer in each step are demonstrated in charge/discharge processes, achieving high reversible capacity (184 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (177&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) of the optimized cathode in Al&#8210;MOF battery. Our findings provide a new insight for rational design of stable high&#8208;energy Al&#8211;MOF batteries.

         <title>Plasmonic Active &#8220;Hot Spots&#8221;&#8208;Confined Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity for CH4 Production</title>

Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures have tremendous potential to be applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, since their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can collect low&#8208;energy&#8208;photons to derive energetic &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; for reducing the CO2 activation&#8208;barrier. However, the hot electron&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is usually limited by poor efficiency and low selectivity for producing kinetically unfavourable hydrocarbons. Here, we propose a new idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalysis to overcome this drawback. We assemble W18O49 nanowires on the outer surface of Au nanoparticles&#8208;embedded TiO2 electrospun nanofibers to obtain lots of Au/TiO2/W18O49 sandwich&#8208;like sub&#8208;structures in the formed plasmonic heterostructure. The short distance (&lt; 10&#160;nm) between Au and adjacent W18O49 can induce an intense plasmon&#8208;coupling to form the active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the sub&#8208;structures. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; are capable of not only gathering the incident light to enhance &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; generation and migration, but also capturing protons and CO through the dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;active&#8208;sites (Au&#8208;O&#8208;Ti and W&#8208;O&#8208;Ti) at the Au/TiO2/W18O49 interface, as evidenced by systematic experiments and simulation analyses. Thus, during photocatalytic CO2 reduction at 43&#177; 2&#8451;,&#160;these active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; enriched in the well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure could synergistically confine the hot&#8208;electron, proton, and CO intermediates for resulting in the CH4 and CO production&#8208;rates at &#8764;35.55 and &#8764;2.57&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, and the CH4&#8208;product selectivity at &#8764;93.3%.

         <title>Interpretation of Rubidium&#8208;based Perovskite Recipes towards Electronic Passivation and Ion Diffusion Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Rubidium cation (Rb+) addition has been witnessed to play a pivotal role in boosting the comprehensive performance of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, the origin of such success derived from irreplaceable superiorities brought by Rb+ remains ambiguous. Herein, grain boundary&#8208;included atomic models, for the first time, have been adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb+ distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution covering both grain interiors and boundaries has been thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron&#8208;based grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior have been expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb+ addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability has been elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb+ concentration on electronic defect, ion migration and phase stability are completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high&#8208;efficiency cascade incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Artificial Hybrid Nanocells for Boosted Vascular Regeneration in Ischemic Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Restoration of sufficient blood supply for the treatment of ischemia remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Here, we introduce a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery technology that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions for the spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration. Specifically, a copper&#8208;containing protein was successfully prepared using a recombinant protein scaffold based on a de novo design strategy, which facilitated the timely release of nitric oxide (NO) and improved accumulation of particles within ischemic tissues. Through closely mimicking physiological cues, we demonstrated the benefits of bioactive factors secreted from hypoxic stem cells on promoting angiogenesis. Following this cell&#8208;mimicking manner, artificial hybrid nano&#8208;sized cells (Hynocell) were constructed by integrating the hypoxic stem cell secretome into nanoparticles with surface coatings of cell membranes fused with copper&#8208;containing protein. The Hynocell, hybridized with different cell&#8208;derived components, provided synergistic effects on targeting ischemic tissues and promoting vascular regeneration in acute hindlimb ischemia and acute myocardial infarction models. This study offers new insights into the utilization of nanotechnology to potentiate the development of cell&#8208;free therapeutics.

         <dc:description>
MOF&#8208;derived electrocatalysts/electrodes have excellent prospects in energy storage and conversion systems. This paper presents an in&#8208;depth review of the application of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and overall water splitting, highlighting experimental and computational results demonstrated in the literature. Recent progress in synthesis routes and strategies used to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of ZIF&#8208;67 derived electrocatalysts is explicitly discussed.








Abstract
Design and construction of low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is a challenging task in the field of catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water&#8208;splitting reaction. Then, different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt&#8208;based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF&#8208;67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal&#8208;doped carbon, noble metal&#8208;supported ZIF&#8208;67 derivatives) reported for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and the perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Artificial Heterogeneous Interphase Layer with Boosted Ion Affinity and Diffusion for Na/K Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic Na (K) is considered a promising anode material for Na (K) metal batteries because of its high theoretical capacity, low electrode potential, and abundant resources. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, we introduce a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K). Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that a heterogeneous Na2S/V (K2S/V) protective layer can effectively improve Na (K)&#8208;ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics, inhibiting the growth of Na (K) dendrites during Na (K) plating/stripping. Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na2S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, and the K2S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na3V2(PO4)3||Na2S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 and a high power density of 23.5&#160;kW kg&#8211;1. Our achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate-based electrolyte, and the K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high power density of 23.5&#160;kW kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high-energy-density metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unconventional Doping Effect Leads to Ultrahigh Average Thermoelectric Power Factor in Cu3SbSe4&#8208;based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric materials are typically highly degenerate semiconductors, which require high carrier concentration. However, the efficiency of conventional doping by replacing host atoms with alien ones is restricted by solubility limit, and more unfavorably, such doping method is likely to cause strong charge carrier scattering at ambient temperature, leading to deteriorated electrical performance. Here, we propose an unconventional doping strategy by using a small trace of alien atoms to stabilize cation vacancies in Cu3SbSe4 by compositing with CuAlSe2, in which cation vacancies rather than alien atoms provide high density of holes. Consequently, the hole concentration enlarges by 6 times but the carrier mobility is well maintained. As a result, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19 &#956;W cm&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 in the temperature range of 300&#8764;723 K is attained. Finally, with further reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a peak zT value of 1.4 and a record&#8208;high average zT value of 0.72 are achieved within the diamond&#8208;like compounds. Our new doping strategy not only can be applied for boosting the average power factor for thermoelectrics, but more generally can be used to maintain carrier mobility for a variety of semiconductors that need high carrier concentration.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Dopant Selection for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: The Case Study of Fe2O3 and CuO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning is applied to guide rational dopant selection in metal oxide photoelectrodes with improved photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. The chemical state is found to be the most significant factor for dopant selection, while dopants with stronger metal&#8211;oxygen bond and larger ionic radius are preferred for charge separation and transfer.








Abstract
Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide&#8208;based semiconductors for solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Machine learning (ML) is promising in providing predictable insights on the dopant selection for high&#8208;performing PEC systems because it can uncover correlations from the seemingly ambiguous linkages between vast features of dopants and the PEC performance of doped photoelectrodes. Herein, the authors successfully build ML model to predict the doping effect of 17 metal dopants into hematite (Fe2O3), a prototype photoelectrode material. Their findings disclose the critical parameters from the 10 intrinsic features of each dopant. The model is further experimentally validated by the coherent prediction on Y and La dopants&#8217; behaviors. Further interpretation of the ML model suggests that the chemical state is the most significant selection criteria, meanwhile, dopants with higher metal&#8211;oxygen bond formation enthalpy and larger ionic radius are favored in improving the charge separation and transfer (CST) in the Fe2O3 photoanodes. The generic feature of this ML guided selection criteria has been further extended to CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes showing improved CST by alkaline metal ions doping.

         <title>Organic Single Crystal Actuators and Waveguides that Operate at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Applications in extreme conditions, such as those encountered in space exploration, require lightweight materials that can retain their elasticity in extremely cold environments. However, cryogenic treatment of most soft polymeric and elastomeric materials results in complete loss of their ability for elastic flow, whereby such materials that are normally ductile become stiff, brittle and prone to cracking. Here we report a facile method for preparation of hybrid organic crystalline materials that are not only cryogenically robust, but are also capable of large, recoverable and reversible deformation at low temperatures. To that end, flexible organic crystals were first mechanically reinforced by polymer coating and combined with a thermally responsive polymer. The resulting hybrid materials respond linearly and reversibly to temperatures from &#8722;15&#176;C to &#8722;120&#176;C without fatigue in air as well as in cold vacuum. The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that is inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost&#8208;effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low&#8208;temperature environmental settings.

         <title>A Redox Couple Strategy Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes by Suppressing Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The poor cycling stability and fast voltage fading resulting from oxygen release during charging, however, severely hinder their practical application. Herein, a strategy of introducing an additional redox couple is first proposed to eliminate the persistent problem of oxygen release. As a proof of concept, the cycling stability of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, which is a typical LMRO cathode, is substantially enhanced with the help of the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple, and the capacity shows no decay with a retention of 100% after 700 cycles at 1C, far superior to the bare counterpart (61.7%). The surface peroxide ions (O22&#8722;) are readily chemically reduced back to immobile O2&#8722; by S2&#8722; during charging, accompanied by the formation of SO32&#8722;, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the oxygen lattice and eventually inhibiting the release of oxygen. More importantly, the S2&#8722; ions are regenerated during the following discharging process and participate in the chemical redox reaction again. Our findings shed light on a potential direction to tackle the poor cycling stability of high&#8208;energy anion&#8208;redox cathode materials for rechargeable metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Heterojunction Annealing Enabling Record Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage in Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) thin&#8208;film solar cell has undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit still remains to be the biggest bottleneck as even the world record device suffers from a large VOC deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) was subjected to a post&#8208;annealing treatment using rapid thermal process. It was found that non&#8208;radiative recombination near the Sb2Se3/CdS HTJ including interface recombination and space charge region recombination were greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb2Se3/CdS thin&#8208;film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record VOC of 0.52&#160;V has been successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated VOC deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) thin-film solar cell has undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) deficit still remains to be the biggest bottleneck as even the world record device suffers from a large &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) was subjected to a post-annealing treatment using rapid thermal process. It was found that non-radiative recombination near the Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS HTJ including interface recombination and space charge region recombination were greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS thin-film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of 0.52&#160;V has been successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Pivotal Role of s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;Block Metals in Water Electrolysis: Status Quo and Perspectives</title>

Abstract
Transition metals, in particular noble metals, are the most common species in metal&#8208;mediated water electrolysis because they serve as highly active catalytic sites. In many cases, the presence of non&#8208;transition metals, that is, s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals with high natural abundance in the earth&#8208;crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline&#8208;earth metals, rare&#8208;earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these non&#8208;transition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments towards a knowledge&#8208;based catalyst design. In this review, we discuss five classes of non&#8208;transition metals species which were successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure&#8208;catalytic activity relationships and phase stability. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field have also been addressed in this account. We anticipate that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals species towards the discovery of advanced polymetal&#8208;containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stretchable and fast self&#8208;healing ionic hydrogel in cryogenic environments for artificial nerve fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials behave irreplaceable advantages in biomimetic intelligent robots (BIR) for avoiding or reducing safety hazards and economic losses from accidental damage during service. However, the self&#8208;healing ability is unreservedly lost and even becomes rigid, fragile in the cryogenic environment where BIR is precisely needed. Here, we report a versatile ionic hydrogel with fast self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and stable conductivity, even at &#8208;80&#8451;. The hydrogel is systematically optimized to improve hydrogen&#8208;bonded network nanostructure, coordinated achieving a quick self&#8208;healing ability within 10&#160;min, large deformation tolerance of over 7000%, superior conductivity of 11.76 S&#183;cm&#8211;1 and anti&#8208;freezing ability, which is difficult to obtain simultaneously. Such hydrogel provides new opportunities for artificial electronic devices in harsh environments. As a prospective application, we fabricate an artificial nerve fiber by mimicking the structure and functions of the myelinated axon, exhibiting the property of fast and potential&#8208;gated signal transmission. This artificial nerve fiber is integrated into a robot for demonstrating a real&#8208;time high fidelity and high throughput information interaction under big deformation and cryogenic temperature. The hydrogel and bionic device will bring pioneering functions for robots and open a broad application scenario in extreme conditions.

         <title>Hybrid Membrane&#8208;Decorated Prussian Blue for Effective Cancer Immunotherapy via Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages Polarization and Hypoxia Relief</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Both tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and hypoxia condition severely restrict the antitumor potency during cancer immunotherapy. It is essential to overcome the two issues for improving therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we built hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption to form Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ. It could facilitate cellular internalization via mannose&#8208;receptor mediated endocytosis and induce TAM polarization via iron ion/HCQ release with HMPB degradation. The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane was camouflaged on Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ surface, denoted as TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, to reduce in vivo reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake, enhance tumor accumulation and mitigate hypoxia. The in vivo results indicated that TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ notably inhibited tumor growth, induced TAM polarization, facilitated cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration and alleviated hypoxia microenvironment. The rational design may provide a new pathway to modulate TME for promoting cancer immunotherapy effects.

         <title>Electrically Programmable Interfacial Adhesion for Ultrastrong Hydrogel Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Adjustable interfacial adhesion is of great significance in smart hydrogel&#8208;related engineering fields. This study presents an electroadhesion strategy for universal and ultrastrong hydrogel bonding with electrically programmable strength. An ionic hydrogel containing lithium ions is designed to achieve hydrated ion diffusion&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, where external electric fields are employed to precisely control spatio&#8208;temporal dynamics of the ion diffusion across ionic adhesion region (IAR). The hydrogel can realize a universal, ultrastrong, efficient, tough, reversible and environmentally tolerant electroadhesion to diverse hydrogels, whose peak adhesion strength and interfacial adhesion toughness are as high as 1.2&#160;MPa and 3750 J m&#8211;2, respectively. With a mechanoelectric coupling model, the dominant role of the hydrated ions in IAR played in the interfacial electroadhesion is further quantitatively revealed. The proposed strategy opens a door for developing high&#8208;performance adhesion hydrogels with electrically programmable functions, which are indispensable for various emerging fields like flexible electronics and soft robotics.

         <title>A Minimalist Binary Vaccine Carrier for Personalized Postoperative Cancer Vaccine Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of minimalist vaccine carriers based on azole molecules&#8208;modified branched polyethylenimine is reported, which orchestrates the innate stimulating activity and antigen cross&#8208;presentation processes in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and achieves impressive personalized vaccine therapy results with the thus prepared binary vaccine.








Abstract
In recent years, significant evolutions have been made in applying nanotechnologies for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine design. However, the clinical translation of nanovaccines is still limited owing to their complicated compositions and difficulties in the spatiotemporal coordination of antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, a minimalist binary nanovaccine (BiVax) is designed that integrates innate stimulating activity into the carrier to elicit robust antitumor immunity. The authors started by making a series of azole molecules end&#8208;capped polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;M), and were&#160;surprised to find that over 60% of the PEI&#8208;M polymers have innate stimulating activity via activation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. PEI&#8208;4BImi, a PEI&#8208;M obtained from a series of polymers, elicits robust antitumor immune responses when used as a subcutaneously injected nanovaccine by simply mixing with ovalbumin antigens, and this BiVax system performs much better than the traditional ternary vaccine system, as well as, commercialized aluminum&#8208;containing adjuvants. This system also enables the fast preparation of personalized BiVax by compositing PEI&#8208;4BImi with autologous tumor cell membrane protein antigens, and a 60% postoperative cure rate is observed when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance In&#8208;Memory Photodetector Realized by Charge Storage in a van der Waals MISFET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;memory photodetector is successfully designed based on a WSe2/h&#8208;BN/SiO2 van der Waals heterostructure, which demonstrates not only an ultrahigh photoresponsivity (337.8 A W&#8722;1) but also an extremely long&#8208;term retention (&gt;10 years). Moreover, the working mechanism with charge&#8208;storage effect of the h&#8208;BN/SiO2 structure is proved through a novel in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy analysis.








Abstract
The emerging data&#8208;intensive applications in optoelectronics are driving innovation toward the fused integration of sensing, memory, and computing to break through the restrictions of the von Neumann architecture. However, the present photodetectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunctions required in single devices. Here, a novel route for the integration of non&#8208;volatile memory into a photodetector is proposed, with a WSe2/h&#8208;BN van der Waals heterostructure on a Si/SiO2 substrate to realize in&#8208;memory photodetection. This photodetector exhibits an ultrahigh readout photocurrent of 3.4 &#181;A and photoresponsivity of 337.8 A W&#8722;1 in the solar&#8208;blind wavelength region, together with an extended retention time of more than 10 years. Furthermore, the charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based non&#8208;volatile mechanism of h&#8208;BN/SiO2 is successfully proven through a novel analysis of in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. These results represent a leap forward to future applications and insightful mechanisms of in&#8208;memory photodetection.

         <title>Synthetic Matrix Scaffolds Engineer the In Vivo Tumor Immune Microenvironment for Immunotherapy Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor growth dynamics and reproducibility of preclinical breast cancer models are improved utilizing a system leveraging synthetic material scaffolds. These scaffolds induce reliable tumor formation and programmable immune infiltration based on composition, enabling enhanced consistency and relevance to human disease. Various immunotherapeutic strategies are tested, revealing differential efficacy based on immune milieu, demonstrating the promise to improve clinical immunotherapy applications.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most powerful anti&#8208;cancer therapies but is stymied by the limits of existing preclinical models with respect to disease latency and reproducibility. Additionally, the influence of differing immune microenvironments within tumors observed clinically and associated with immunotherapeutic resistance cannot be tuned to facilitate drug testing workflows without changing model system or laborious genetic approaches. To address this testing platform gap in the immune oncology drug development pipeline, the authors deploy engineered biomaterials as scaffolds to increase tumor formation rate, decrease disease latency, and diminish variability of immune infiltrates into tumors formed from murine mammary carcinoma cell lines implanted into syngeneic mice. By altering synthetic gel formulations that reshape infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, responsiveness of the same tumor model to varying classes of cancer immunotherapies, including in situ vaccination with a molecular adjuvant and immune checkpoint blockade, diverge. These results demonstrate the significant role the local immune microenvironment plays in immunotherapeutic response. These engineered tumor immune microenvironments therefore improve upon the limitations of current breast tumor models used for immune oncology drug screening to enable immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments underlying immunotherapeutic resistance seen in human patients.

         <title>A Universal Ternary&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Ink Strategy toward Efficient Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally&#8208;friendly ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink system with excellent printability and film&#8208;forming ability is tailor&#8208;made for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). A record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs for the first time.








Abstract
Toward next&#8208;generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high&#8208;quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology toward practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX3) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs. With this tailor&#8208;made ternary halogen&#8208;free solvent (naphthene, n&#8208;tridecane, and n&#8208;nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX3 QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film&#8208;forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and n&#8208;tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43&#160;883.39&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system&#8208;based devices (EQE = 2.26%). Moreover, the ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet&#8208;printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)&#8208;based QLEDs. This work demonstrates a new strategy for tailor&#8208;making a general ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;QD&#8208;ink system for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs as well as the other solution&#8208;processed electronic devices in the future.

         <dc:description>
Emerging S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. Design principles for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Direct characterization methods for electron transfer in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are presented. Different photocatalytic applications are summarized. Especially, the curved Fermi level in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interface is discussed.








Abstract

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Efficient Sequential Drug Delivery of Biomimetic Nanosystem for Multimodal Chemo&#8208;, Antiangiogenic, and Anti&#8208;MDSC Therapy in Melanoma</title>

         <dc:description>
The biomimetic DS@HLipo targets the tumor site, where near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeation triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib for both antiangiogenic therapy and anti&#8208;MDSC immunotherapy. The liberated doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) from the liposomes can then be more easily ingested by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy.








Abstract
In view of the multiple pathological hallmarks of tumors, nanosystems for the sequential delivery of various drugs whose targets are separately located inside and outside tumor cells are desired for improved cancer therapy. However, current sequential delivery is mainly achieved through enzyme&#8208; or acid&#8208;dependent degradation of the nanocarrier, which would be influenced by the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, and unloading efficiency of the drug acting on the target outside tumor cells is usually unsatisfactory. Here, a light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy based on a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) and free sunitinib in the aqueous cavity, is developed. The liposomal membrane is doped with photosensitizer porphyrin&#8211;phospholipid (PoP) and hybridized with red blood cell membrane to confer biomimetic features. Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeabilization triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib (100% release in 5&#160;min) for antiangiogenic therapy and also myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) inhibition to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Subsequently, the small&#8208;sized DOX&#8208;NP liberated from the liposomes is more easily uptaken by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy. RNA sequencing and immune&#8208;related assay indicates therapeutic immune enhancement. This light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy demonstrates the potency in cancer multimodal therapy against multiple targets in different spatial positions in tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Design Rules of a Sulfur Redox Electrocatalyst for Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Seeking an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides to insoluble products is crucial to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and thus increase their practical energy density. We have used Mn&#8208;based mullite (SmMn2O5) as a model catalyst for the sulfur redox reaction to show how the design rules involving lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection improve catalyst performance. Theoretical simulation shows that the positions of Mn and O active sites on the (001) surface, are a good match with those of Li and S atoms in polysulfides, resulting in their tight anchoring to each other. Fundamentally, dz2 and dx2&#8208;y2 around the Fermi level are found to be crucial for strongly coupling with the p&#8208;orbitals of the polysulfides and thus decreasing the redox overpotential. Following the theoretical calculation, SmMn2O5 catalyst has been synthesized and used as an interlayer in a Li&#8208;S battery. The resulted battery has a high cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 0.5 C and more promisingly a high areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved with a sulfur loading of &#8764;5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 under a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) value &#8764;4.6&#160;&#956;L mg&#8211;1 condition.

         <title>2D FeOCl: A Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor Synthesized via Temperature&#8208;Oscillation Chemical Vapor Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) transition&#8208;metal oxyhalides with low symmetry, novel magnetism, and good stability provide a versatile platform for conducting fundamental research and developing spintronics. Antiferromagnetic FeOCl has attracted significant interest owing to its unique semiconductor properties and relatively high N&#233;el temperature. Herein, good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized using the universal temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport (TO&#8208;CVT) method. The crystal structure, bandgap, and anisotropic behavior of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. The absorption spectrum and electrical measurements reveal that 2D FeOCl is a semiconductor with an optical bandgap of &#8764;2.1&#160;eV and a resistivity of &#8764;10&#8211;1 &#937;&#183;m at 295 K, and the bandgap increases with decreasing thickness. Strong in&#8208;plane optical and electrical anisotropies are observed in 2D FeOCl flakes, and the maximum resistance anisotropic ratio reaches 2.66 at 295 K. Additionally, the lattice vibration modes are studied through temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectra and first&#8208;principles density functional calculations. A significant decrease in the Raman frequencies below the N&#233;el temperature is observed, which results from the strong spin&#8208;phonon coupling effect in 2D FeOCl. This study provides a high&#8208;quality low&#8208;symmetry vdW magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronics.

         <title>Bioinspired Five&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozyme for Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) represent a new research frontier in the biomedical fields. The rational design and controllable synthesis of SAzymes with well&#8208;defined electronic and geometric structures are essential for maximizing their enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity and therapeutic efficacy but remain challenging. Here we first report a melamine&#8208;mediated pyrolysis activation strategy for the controllable fabrication of iron&#8208;based SAzyme containing five&#8208;coordinated structure (FeN5), identified by transmission electron microscopy imaging and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses. The FeN5 SAzyme exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity owing to the optimized coordination structure, and the corresponding catalytic efficiency of Fe&#8208;species in FeN5 SAzyme is 7.64 and 3.45 &#215; 105 times higher than those in traditional FeN4 SAzyme and Fe3O4 nanozyme, respectively, demonstrated by steady&#8208;state kinetic assay. In addition, the catalytic mechanism is jointly disclosed by experimental results and density functional theory studies. The as&#8208;synthesized FeN5 SAzyme demonstrates significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo due to the excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity under tumor microenvironment.

         <title>High&#8208;Z Sensitized Radiotherapy Synergizes with the Intervention of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway for In Situ Tumor Vaccination</title>

Abstract
In situ tumor vaccination has been preliminarily pursued to strengthen anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Immunogenic tumor cell death would spontaneously release abundant antigens and adjuvants for activation of dendritic cells (DCs), providing a paragon opportunity for establishing efficient in situ vaccination. Herein, we construct Phy@PLGdH nanosheets by integrating Physcion (Phy, an inhibitor of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) with layered gadolinium hydroxide nanosheets (PLGdH nanosheets) to boost Radiation Therapy (RT)&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for potent in situ tumor vaccination. We first observe that sheet&#8208;like PLGdH could present superior X&#8208;ray deposition and tumor penetrability, exhibiting improved Radio&#8208;sensitization in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the destruction of cellular NADPH and nucleotide homeostasis by Phy&#8208;mediated PPP intervention could further amplify PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage, which correspondingly result in effective ICD and enhance the immunogenicity of irradiated tumor cells. Consequently, Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT successfully primes robust CD8+ T cell dependent antitumor immunity to potentiate checkpoint blockade immunotherapies against primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;Derivative Decorated Hierarchical Porous Host Enabling Ultrahigh Rates and Superior Long&#8208;Term Cycling of Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their high intrinsic capacity, high safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, uncontrollable dendrite growth and adverse side reactions of Zn anodes seriously hinder their further application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous graphene&#8208;carbon nanotubes scaffold decorated with metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derived ZnO/C nanoparticles (3D&#8208;ZGC) is fabricated as the host for dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal composite anodes. The zincophilic ZnO/C nanoparticles act as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to induce homogeneous Zn deposition. The mechanically robust 3D scaffold with high conductivity not only suppresses the formation of dendritic Zn by reducing the local current density and homogenizing Zn2+ ion flux, but also inhibits volume changes during the long&#8208;term plating/stripping process. As a result, the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anodes afford unprecedented Zn plating&#8208;stripping stability at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for 1500 cycles with low overpotential (&lt;65&#160;mV) when used in a symmetric cell. When coupled with MnO2 cathodes, the assembled Zn@3D&#8208;ZGC//MnO2 full batteries deliver an enhanced cycling stability for up to 6000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8211;1, demonstrating the potential of the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anode for advanced Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Transforming the chemical structure and bio&#8208;nano activity of doxorubicin by ultrasound for selective killing of cancer cells</title>

Abstract
Reconfiguring the structure and selectivity of existing chemotherapeutics represents an opportunity for developing novel tumor&#8208;selective drugs. Here; we demonstrate; as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept; the use of high&#8208;frequency sound waves to transform the non&#8208;selective anthracycline doxorubicin into a tumor selective drug molecule. The transformed drug self&#8208;aggregates in water to form &#8764;200&#160;nm nanodrugs; without requiring organic solvents; chemical agents and surfactants. The nanodrugs preferentially interact with lipid rafts; abundant in the mitochondria of cancer cells. The mitochondrial localization of the nanodrugs plays a key role in inducing reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated selective death of human breast cancer; colorectal carcinoma; ovarian carcinoma and drug&#8208;resistant cell lines. Only marginal cytotoxicity (80&#8208;100% cell viability) towards fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes is observed; even after administration of high doses of the nanodrug (25&#8208;40&#160;&#956;g/mL). Penetration; cytotoxicity and selectivity of the nanodrugs in tumor mimicking tissues are validated by using a 3D co&#8208;culture of cancer and healthy cells and 3D cell&#8208;collagen constructs in a perfusion bioreactor. The nanodrugs exhibit tropism for lung and limited accumulation in the liver and spleen; as suggested by in vivo biodistribution studies. Our results highlight the potential of this approach to transform the structure and bioactivity of commercial anticancer drugs and antibiotics bearing sono&#8208;active moieties.

         <title>Bioinspired lipoproteins of furoxans&#8208;oxaliplatin remodels physical barriers in tumor to potentiate T&#8208;cell infiltration</title>

Abstract
The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we synthesized a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8208;oxaliplatin (FO) and designed a stroma cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S&#8208;LFO), aiming to facilitate CTLs infiltration in tumors for anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. S&#8208;LFO treatment significantly promoted tumor vessel normalization and eliminated multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96&#8208;, 5.02&#8208; and 8.65&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells, their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and granzyme B&#8208;expressing sub&#8208;types when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S&#8208;LFO with an anti&#8208;programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (aPD&#8208;L1) produced notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extended survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTLs infiltration for anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Epitaxial Ferroelectric Oxide Nano&#8208;spring with Super&#8208;scalability</title>

Abstract
Oxide nano&#8208;springs have attracted many research interests because of their anti&#8208;corrosion, high&#8208;temperature tolerance, oxidation resistance, and enhanced&#8208;mechanic&#8208;response from unique helix structures, enabling various nano&#8208;manipulators, nano&#8208;motors, nano&#8208;switches, sensors, and energy harvesters. However, preparing oxide nano&#8208;springs is a challenge for their intrinsic lack of elasticity. Here, we developed an approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled, epitaxial, ferroelectric nano&#8208;springs with built&#8208;in strain due to the lattice mismatch in freestanding La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 (LSMO/BTO) bilayer heterostructures. We find that these LSMO/BTO nano&#8208;springs can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometry limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under co&#8208;existing axial and shear strains. In addition, the oxide hetero&#8208;structural springs exhibit strong resilience due to the limited plastic deformation nature and the built&#8208;in strain between the bilayers. This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nano&#8208;springs that can be applied to various technologies.

         <title>Polymerized Small Molecular Acceptor with Branched Side Chains for All Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 16.7%</title>

Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of small molecule acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based organic solar cells have already exceeded 18%. However, the development of polymer acceptors still lags far behind their SMA counterparts mainly due to the lack of efficient polymer acceptors. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X (with X being the branched alkyl chain) by employing the same central core with the SMA L8&#8208;BO but with different branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains on the beta position of the thiophene unit has previously shown improved structural order and charge transport compared to those of Y6. It was found that the molecular packing of SMA&#8208;HD featuring 2&#8208;hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY&#8208;HD is similar to L8&#8208;BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high&#8208;order molecular assembly in SMA&#8208;HD molecules. When combined with PM6, PY&#8208;HD&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) exhibits a high PCE of 16.41%, representing the highest PCE value for the binary all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, the side&#8208;chain modification on the pyrrole site position further improves the performance of the all&#8208;PSCs, and the PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device delivers a new record high efficiency of 16.76% (certified as 16.3%), with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.949&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 23.73&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and a decent fill factor of 74.4%. Our work provides new insights for understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship of polymer acceptors and paves a feasible avenue to develop efficient conjugated polymer acceptors.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal&#8208;Infused Porous Surfaces for Manipulation of Underwater Gas Bubble Transport and Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomimetic artificial surfaces that enable the manipulation of gas bubble mobility have been explored in a wide range of applications in nanomaterial synthesis, surface defouling, biomedical diagnostics, and therapeutics. Although many superhydrophobic surfaces and isotropic lubricant&#8208;infused porous surfaces have been developed to manipulate gas bubbles, the simultaneous control over the adhesion and transport of gas bubbles underwater remains a challenge. Thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs), a class of structured fluids, provide an opportunity to tune the behavior of gas bubbles through LC mesophase transitions using a variety of external stimuli. Using this central idea, we report the design and synthesis of liquid crystal&#8208;infused porous surfaces (LCIPS) and elucidate the effects of the LC mesophase on the transport and adhesion of gas bubbles on LCIPS immersed in water. We demonstrate that LCIPS are a promising class of surfaces with an unprecedented level of responsiveness and functionality, which enable the design of cyanobacteria&#8208;inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen levels in biomimetic cell cultures.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Deposited and Patternable Conductive Polymer Thin Film Electrodes for Microbial Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Microbial bioelectronic devices integrate naturally occurring or synthetically engineered electroactive microbes with microelectronics. These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, we report a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics. Our coating is based on a blend of PEDOT:PSS crosslinked with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying ITO electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current&#8208;producing bacterium&#160;Shewanella oneidensis&#160;MR&#8208;1, this material produces&#160;a 178&#8208;fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin&#8208;film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. We characterize the chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings and demonstrate the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based microbial sensors. We envision that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Synergetic Anion Vacancies and Dense Heterointerfaces into Bimetal Chalcogenide Nanosheet Arrays for Boosting Electrocatalysis Sulfur Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenide. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenide in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn&#8208;S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur&#8208;vacancy and build&#8208;in interfacial field in CoZn&#8208;S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well&#8208;designed 3D nanosheet array structures short ion&#8208;transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn&#8208;S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the build&#8208;in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improve their intrinsic activity.

Abstract
A reliable method for preparing a conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer with a thickness of 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level, was tested as a possible Cu diffusion barrier layer for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh density semiconductor device miniaturization. A polystyrene brush of uniform thickness was grafted onto 4&#8208;inch SiO2/Si wafer substrates with &#8220;self&#8208;limiting&#8221; chemistry favoring such a uniform layer. UV crosslinking and subsequent carbonization transformed this polymer film into an ultrathin a&#8208;C layer without pinholes or hillocks. The uniform coating of nonplanar regions or surfaces is also possible. The Cu diffusion &#8220;blocking ability&#8221; was evaluated by time&#8208;dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests using a metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure. A 0.82&#160;nm&#8208;thick a&#8208;C barrier gave TDDB lifetimes 3.3&#215; longer than that obtained using the conventional 1.0&#160;nm&#8208;thick TaNx diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a&#8208;C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom&#8208;scale thickness, and when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.

         <title>Biomineralized Materials as Model Systems for Structural Composites: 3D Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomineralized materials are sophisticated material systems with hierarchical 3D organizations of minerals and organics, which have been broadly used as model systems for fundamental mechanical, materials science, and biomimetic studies. Our current knowledge of the structure of biological materials is mainly based on 2D imaging techniques, which often impedes comprehensive and accurate understanding of the materials&#8217; intricate 3D architecture and consequently their mechanics, functions, and bioinspired designs. The development of 3D techniques like tomography, additive manufacturing, and 4D testing has opened pathways to study biological materials fully in 3D. In this review, we discuss how applying 3D techniques can provide new insights into biomineralized materials that are either well&#8208;known or possess complex microstructures that are extremely challenging to understand in the 2D framework. Specifically, the diverse structures of biomineralized materials are understood based on four universal structural motifs. Nacre is selected as an example to demonstrate how the progression of knowledge from 2D to 3D can bring substantial improvements to the growth mechanism, biomechanics theories, and bioinspired designs. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiscale 3D tomographic techniques are discussed with a focus on their integration with 3D geometric quantification, 4D in&#8208;situ experiments, and multiscale modeling. Outlook is given on the emerging approaches to investigate the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;function&#8208;biomimetics relationship.

         <title>Advances in High&#8208;Performance Autonomous Energy and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing Textiles with Novel 3D Fabric Structures</title>

Abstract
The seamless integration of emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology with traditional wearable textile materials has given the birth to the next&#8208;generation smart textiles, i.e., textile TENGs, which will play a vital role in the era of Internet of Things and artificial intelligences. However, low output power and inferior sensing ability have largely limited the development of textile TENGs. Among various approaches to improve the output and sensing performance, such as material modification, structural design, and environmental management, 3D fabric structural scheme is a facile, efficient, controllable and scalable strategy to increase the effective contact area for contact electrification of textile TENGs without cumbersome material processing and service area restrictions. In this review, the recent advances of the current reported textile TENGs with 3D fabric structures are comprehensively summarized and systematically analyzed in order to clarify their superiorities over 1D fiber and 2D fabric structures in terms of power output and pressure sensing. The forward&#8208;looking integration abilities of the 3D fabrics are also discussed at the end. We hope that the overview and analysis of textile TENGs with distinctive 3D fabric structures will contribute to the development and realization of high&#8208;power output micro/nano wearable power sources and high&#8208;quality self&#8208;powered wearable sensors.
