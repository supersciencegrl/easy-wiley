      <title>The Use of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembly and Nanocellulose to Prepare Advanced Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The current literature on the use of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled structures of nanocelluloses and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes for the preparation of strong, adhesive, electrically interactive, and biologically interactive thin films is summarized. By using this renewable and biodegradable nanomaterial, it is shown possible to prepare high&#8208;performance materials in a noncomplicated way.








Abstract
The current knowledge about the formation of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assemblies using combinations of nanocelluloses (NCs) and polyelectrolytes is reviewed. Herein, the fundamentals behind the LbL formation, with a major focus on NCs, are considered. Following this, a special description of the limiting factors for the formation of LbLs of only NCs, both anionic and cationic, and the combination&#160;of NCs and polyelectrolytes/nanoparticles is provided. The ability of the NCs and polyelectrolytes to form dense films with excellent mechanical properties and with tailored optical properties is then reviewed. How low&#8208;density, wet stable&#160;networks of cellulose nanofibrils can be used as substrates for the preparation of antibacterial, electrically interactive, and fire&#8208;retardant materials by forming well&#8208;defined LbLs inside these networks is then considered. A short outlook of the possible uses of LbLs containing NCs is given to conclude.

      <title>3D Microstructures of Liquid Crystal Networks with Programmed Voxelated Director Fields</title>
      <dc:description>
3D liquid crystal network microstructures, such as micrometer&#8208;scale suspended films, helical coils, and circular rings, with programmable 3D director fields are demonstrated with direct laser writing. High&#8208;resolution (around 5 &#181;m) programmed fields are enabled by pixelated microchannels. Various shape morphing modes are obtained by varying the programmed 3D director fields inside the same liquid crystal network microstructures.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;shifting behavior of liquid crystal networks (LCNs) and elastomers (LCEs) is a result of an interplay between their initial geometrical shape and their molecular alignment. For years, reliance on either one&#8208;step in situ or two&#8208;step film processing techniques has limited the shape&#8208;change transformations from 2D to 3D geometries. The combination of various fabrication techniques, alignment methods, and chemical formulations developed in recent years has introduced new opportunities to achieve 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape&#8208;transformations in large scales, albeit the precise control of local molecular alignment in microscale 3D constructs remains a challenge. Here, the voxel&#8208;by&#8208;voxel encoding of nematic alignment in 3D microstructures of LCNs produced by two&#8208;photon polymerization using high&#8208;resolution topographical features is demonstrated. 3D LCN microstructures (suspended films, coils, and rings) with designable 2D and 3D director fields with a resolution of 5 &#181;m are achieved. Different shape transformations of LCN microstructures with the same geometry but dissimilar molecular alignments upon actuation are elicited. This strategy offers higher freedom in the shape&#8208;change programming of 3D LCN microstructures and expands their applicability in emerging technologies, such as small&#8208;scale soft robots and devices and responsive surfaces.

      <title>In Situ Deprotection of Polymeric Binders for Solution&#8208;Processible Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry is employed to resolve a dilemma pertaining to polarity compatibility among the binder, solvent, and solid electrolyte for sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The polar functional groups of the binder, initially protected by tert&#8208;butyl groups during the slurry mixing stage, are deprotected when the electrode is dried. The polar binder enhances electrode adhesion and electrochemical performance drastically.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) have been featured as promising alternatives to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) mainly owing to their superior safety. Nevertheless, a solution&#8208;based scalable manufacturing scheme has not yet been established because of the incompatible polarity of the binder, solvent, and sulfide electrolyte during slurry preparation. This dilemma is overcome by subjecting the acrylate (co)polymeric binders to protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry. Protection by the&#160;tert&#8208;butyl group allows for homogeneous dispersion of the binder in the slurry based on a relatively less polar solvent, with subsequent heat&#8208;treatment during the drying process to cleave the&#160;tert&#8208;butyl group. This exposes the polar carboxylic acid groups, which are then able to engage in hydrogen bonding with the active cathode material, high&#8208;nickel layered oxide. Deprotection strengthens the electrode adhesion such that the strength equals that of commercial LIB electrodes, and the key electrochemical performance parameters are improved markedly in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell settings. The present study highlights the potential of sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs for scalable manufacturing and also provides insights that protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry can generally be used for various battery cells that suffer from polarity incompatibility among multiple electrode components.

      <title>A Compliant Ionic Adhesive Electrode with Ultralow Bioelectronic Impedance</title>
      <dc:description>
A compliant ionic adhesive electrode, based on an alginate&#8211;polyacrylamide (Alg&#8208;PAAm) hydrogel, with ultralow interfacial impedance on the skin is created to record dynamically weak surface electromyography signals with high SNR and low crosstalk. Due to excellent properties, a prosthetic hand is successfully driven to precisely grasp a needle based on the Alg&#8208;PAAm compliant electrodes.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) but low crosstalk is of great importance for weak surface electromyography (sEMG) signals when precisely driving a prosthesis to perform sophisticated activities. However, due to gaps with the curved skin during muscle contraction, many electrodes have poor compliance with skin and suffer from high bioelectrical impedance. This causes serious noise and error in the signals, especially the signals from low&#8208;level muscle contractions. Here, the design of a compliant electrode based on an adhesive hydrogel, alginate&#8211;polyacrylamide (Alg&#8208;PAAm) is reported, which eliminates those large gaps through the strong electrostatic interaction and abundant hydrogen bond with the skin. The obtained compliant electrode, having an ultralow bioelectrical impedance of &#8776;20 k&#937;, can monitor even 2.1% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of muscle. Furthermore, benefiting from the high SNR of &gt;5:1 at low&#8208;level MVC, the crosstalk from irrelevant muscle is minimized through reducing the electrode size. Finally, a prosthesis is successfully demonstrated to precisely grasp a needle based on a 9 mm2 Alg&#8208;PAAm compliant electrode. The strategy to design such compliant electrodes provides the potential for improving the quality of dynamically weak sEMG signals to precisely control prosthesis in performing purposefully dexterous activity.

      <title>Suppressing Defects&#8208;Induced Nonradiative Recombination for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells through Green Antisolvent Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Antisolvent engineering is employed to tune the crystal nucleation and grain growth of perovskite for achieving efficient perovskite solar cells. The engineering of green&#8208;antisolvent&#8208;MABr&#8208;Eth&#8208;treated perovskites suppressing defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in perovskite solar cells is developed. As expected, the device delivers over 21% power conversion efficiency and a better storage and light&#8208;soaking stability.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. Traditional one&#8208;step solution&#8208;processed perovskites often suffer from defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination, which significantly hinders the improvement of device performance. Herein, treatment with green antisolvents for achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films is reported. Compared to defects&#8208;filled ones, perovskite films by antisolvent treatment using methylamine bromide (MABr) in ethanol (MABr&#8208;Eth) not only enhances the resultant perovskite crystallinity with large grain size, but also passivates the surface defects. In this case, the engineering of MABr&#8208;Eth&#8208;treated perovskites suppressing defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is demonstrated. As a result, the fabricated inverted planar heterojunction device of ITO/PTAA/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3/PC61BM/Phen&#8208;NADPO/Ag exhibits the best power conversion efficiency of 21.53%. Furthermore, the corresponding PSCs possess a better storage and light&#8208;soaking stability.

      <title>Laser Generation of Sub&#8208;Micrometer Wrinkles in a Chalcogenide Glass Film as Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
The formation of random patterns induced by a laser pulse focused on amorphous Ge&#8208;based chalcogenide thin film capped with a very thin SiN layer is demonstrated. These non&#8208;deterministic surface patterns are wrinkles of sub&#8208;100 nm height with a sub&#8208;micrometer periodicity that depends on the impinging laser fluence. Application as physical unclonable functions is demonstrated using a dedicated fast recognition algorithm.








Abstract
Laser interaction with solids is routinely used for functionalizing materials' surfaces. In most cases, the generation of patterns/structures is the key feature to endow materials with specific properties like hardening, superhydrophobicity, plasmonic color&#8208;enhancement, or dedicated functions like anti&#8208;counterfeiting tags. A way to generate random patterns, by means of generation of wrinkles on surfaces resulting from laser melting of amorphous Ge&#8208;based chalcogenide thin films, is presented. These patterns, similar to fingerprints, are modulations of the surface height by a few tens of nanometers with a sub&#8208;micrometer periodicity. It is shown that the patterns' spatial frequency depends on the melted layer thickness, which can be tuned by varying the impinging laser fluence. The randomness of these patterns makes them an excellent candidate for the generation of physical unclonable function tags (PUF&#8208;tags) for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. Two specific ways are tested to identify the obtained PUF&#8208;tag: cross&#8208;correlation procedure or using a neural network. In both cases, it is demonstrated that the PUF&#8208;tag can be compared to a reference image (PUF&#8208;key) and identified with a high recognition ratio on most real application conditions. This paves the way to straightforward non&#8208;deterministic PUF&#8208;tag generation dedicated to small sensitive parts such as, for example, electronic devices/components, jewelry, or watchmak.

      <title>3D Ordering at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Polar Interface of Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
Experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations highlight&#160;the 3D nature of&#160;atomic&#8208;scale ordering of liquid Ga in contact with solid GaAs in a nanowire growth configuration, elucidating the&#160;role played by the liquid ordering in controlling the growth.








Abstract
The nature of the liquid&#8211;solid interface determines the characteristics of a variety of physical phenomena, including catalysis, electrochemistry, lubrication, and crystal growth. Most of the established models for crystal growth are based on macroscopic thermodynamics, neglecting the atomistic nature of the liquid&#8211;solid interface. Here, experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations are employed to identify the 3D nature of an atomic&#8208;scale ordering of liquid Ga in contact with solid GaAs in a nanowire growth configuration. An interplay between the liquid ordering and the formation of a new bilayer is revealed, which, contrary to the established theories, suggests that the preference for a certain polarity and polytypism is influenced by the atomic structure of the interface. The conclusions of this work open new avenues for the understanding of crystal growth, as well as other processes and systems involving a liquid&#8211;solid interface.

      <title>In&#8208;Memory Computing with Memristor Content Addressable Memories for Pattern Matching</title>
      <dc:description>
Memristor content addressable memory (CAM) arrays with nanoscale memristor devices are developed experimentally and used to demonstrate two novel computing applications on&#8208;chip&#8212;network security intrusion detection using a finite state machine and definable inexact pattern matching in a Levenshtein automata for genomic sequencing. This work demonstrates the promise of in&#8208;memory compute circuits using emerging devices to accelerate broad computing applications.








Abstract
The dramatic rise of data&#8208;intensive workloads has revived application&#8208;specific computational hardware for continuing speed and power improvements, frequently achieved by limiting data movement and implementing &#8220;in&#8208;memory computation&#8221;. However, conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit designs can still suffer low power efficiency, motivating designs leveraging nonvolatile resistive random access memory (ReRAM), and with many studies focusing on crossbar circuit architectures. Another circuit primitive&#8212;content addressable memory (CAM)&#8212;shows great promise for mapping a diverse range of computational models for in&#8208;memory computation, with recent ReRAM&#8211;CAM designs proposed but few experimentally demonstrated. Here, programming and control of memristors across an 86 &#215; 12 memristor ternary CAM (TCAM) array integrated with CMOS are demonstrated, and parameter tradeoffs for optimizing speed and search margin are evaluated. In addition to smaller area, this memristor TCAM results in significantly lower power due to very low programmable conductance states, motivating CAM use in a wider range of computational applications than conventional TCAMs are confined to today. Finally, the first experimental demonstration of two computational models in memristor TCAM arrays is reported: regular expression matching in a finite state machine for network security intrusion detection and definable inexact pattern matching in a Levenshtein automata for genomic sequencing.

      <title>Shielding Polysulfide Intermediates by an Organosulfur&#8208;Containing Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Lithium Anode in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An organosulfur&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is tailored for the stabilization of the Li anode in Li&#8211;S batteries by employing 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)thiophenol as an electrolyte additive. The organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI protects the Li anode from the detrimental reactions with Li polysulfides (LiPSs). A Li&#8211;S battery delivers 82 cycles with an organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI in comparison to 42 cycles with a routine SEI under practical conditions.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery system, in which the dissolution&#8211;precipitation redox reactions of the S cathode are critical. However, soluble Li polysulfides (LiPSs), as the indispensable intermediates, easily diffuse to the Li anode and react with the Li metal severely, thus depleting the active materials and inducing the rapid failure of the battery, especially under practical conditions. Herein, an organosulfur&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is tailored for the stabilizaiton of the Li anode in Li&#8211;S batteries by employing 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)thiophenol as an electrolyte additive. The organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI protects the Li anode from the detrimental reactions with LiPSs and decreases its corrosion. Under practical conditions with a high&#8208;loading S cathode (4.5 mgS cm&#8722;2), a low electrolyte/S ratio (5.0&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1), and an ultrathin Li anode (50&#160;&#181;m), a Li&#8211;S battery delivers 82 cycles with an organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI in comparison to 42 cycles with a routine SEI. This work provokes the vital insights into the role of the organic components of SEI in the protection of the Li anode in practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens Married to 2D Black Phosphorus Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Multimodal Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on both aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens and 2D black phosphorus nanomaterials is successfully developed. The presented hybrid nanotheranostic system possesses distinctive properties, endowing it with excellent performance for in vitro and in vivo cancer theranostics involving NIR fluorescence&#8211;photothermal dual imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic&#8211;photothermal therapies.








Abstract
Inspired by the respective advantages of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active photosensitizers and black phosphorus nanomaterials in cancer treatment, the facile construction of novel AIE photosensitizers married to 2D black phosphorus nanosheets and their application for multimodal theranostics are demonstrated. The developed nanomaterial simultaneously possesses distinctive properties and multiple functions including excellent stability, good biocompatibility, intensive fluorescence emission in the NIR region, high&#8208;performance reactive oxygen species generation, good photothermal conversion efficiency, outstanding cellular uptake, and effective accumulation at the tumor site. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluation show that the presented nanotheranostic system is an excellent candidate for NIR fluorescence&#8211;photothermal dual imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic&#8211;photothermal therapies. This study thus not only extends the applications scope of AIE and black phosphorus materials, but also offers useful insights into designing a new generation of cancer theranostic protocol for potential clinical applications.

Abstract
Thermally insulating materials based on renewable nanomaterials such as nanocellulose could reduce the energy consumption and the environmental impact of the building sector. Recent reports of superinsulating cellulose nanomaterial (CNM)&#8208;based aerogels and foams with significantly better heat transport properties than the commercially dominating materials, such as expanded polystyrene, polyurethane foams, and glass wool, have resulted in a rapidly increasing research activity. Herein, the fundamental basis of thermal conductivity of porous materials is described, and the anisotropic heat transfer properties of CNMs and films with aligned CNMs and the processing and structure of novel CNM&#8208;based aerogels and foams with low thermal conductivities are presented and discussed. The extraordinarily low thermal conductivity of anisotropic porous architectures and multicomponent approaches are highlighted and related to the contributions of the Knudsen effect and phonon scattering.

      <title>High Photon Upconversion Efficiency with Hybrid Triplet Sensitizers by Ultrafast Hole&#8208;Routing in Electronic&#8208;Doped Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Semiconductor nanocrystals doped with electronic impurities are proposed as triplet sensitizers in photon upconversion assisted by triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Upon photoexcitation, the nanocrystals&#8217; photoholes are routed to a long&#8208;living, impurity&#8208;related state in resonance with the capping ligands&#8217; triplet. This results in 100% efficiency in triplet sensitization and leads to the highest upconversion quantum yield ever achieved for nanocrystal&#8208;based TTA upconverters.








Abstract
Low&#8208;power photon upconversion (UC) based on sensitized triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (sTTA) is considered as the most promising upward wavelength&#8208;shifting technique to enhance the light&#8208;harvesting capability of solar devices. Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) with conjugated organic ligands have been recently proposed to extend the limited light&#8208;harvesting capability of molecular absorbers. Key to their functioning is efficient energy transfer (ET) from the NC to the triplet state of the ligands that sensitize free annihilator moieties responsible for the upconverted luminescence. The ET efficiency is typically limited by parasitic processes, above all nonradiative hole&#8208;transfer to the ligand highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Here, a new exciton&#8208;manipulation approach is demonstrated that enables loss&#8208;free ET by electronically doping CdSe NCs with gold impurities that introduce a hole&#8208;accepting intragap state above the HOMO energy of 9&#8208;anthracene acid ligands. Upon photoexcitation, the NC photoholes are rapidly routed to the Au&#8208;level, producing a long&#8208;lived bound exciton in perfect resonance with the ligand triplet. This hinders hole&#8208;transfer leading to &#8776;100% efficient ET that translates into an upconversion quantum yield as high as &#8776;12% (&#8776;24% in the normalized definition), which is the highest performance for NC&#8208;based upconverters based on sTTA to date and approaches the record efficiency of optimized organic systems.

      <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterial is rationally designed and synthesized. Due to the 2D morphology and high surface potential, a prototype device made of MOF&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials can efficiently harvest the electric energy from water evaporation.








Abstract
The continuous exploration of clean&#8208;energy technology is critical for the sustainable development of society. The recent work on the electric energy harvesting from water evaporation has made a significant contribution to the utilization of clean energy for self&#8208;powering systems. Here, a novel metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterial is delicately designed and synthesized by the growth of UIO&#8208;66 nanoparticles on 2D AlOOH nanoflakes. Due to the combined merits from the 2D morphology, which is inherited from the AlOOH nanoflakes, and the high surface potential, which originates from the UIO&#8208;66 nanoparticles, the device made of the AlOOH/UIO&#8208;66 hybrid nanomaterials can harvest electric energy from natural water evaporation. An open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.63 &#177; 0.10 V can be achieved on the prototype devices made of the hybrid nanomaterial. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a small electric appliance, e.g., a digital calculator, is powered up by a 3 &#215; 3 device array connected in a combined series&#8211;parallel configuration.

      <title>A Highly Efficient and Stable Blue&#8208;Emitting Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 with a 1D Chain Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
A new Cu&#8208;based emitting material of Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 that exhibits ultrabright blue&#8208;emission with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield of &#8776;95% and outstanding long&#8208;term air&#8208;stability is reported. The single&#8208;crystal structure determination reveals that the Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 consists of 1D zigzag chains. Theoretical calculations and extensive comparative study clarify that the localized nature of the valence band maximum is essential in obtaining efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton emission.








Abstract
In the field of photonics, alkali copper(I) halides attract considerable attention as lead&#8208;free emitters. The intrinsic quantum confinement effects originating from low&#8208;dimensional electronic structure lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Among them, Cs3Cu2I5 is the most promising candidate, satisfying both high PLQY and air stability. In this study, a strategy to explore a new material meeting these requirements through the use of the mixed&#8208;anions of I&#8722; and Cl&#8722; is proposed. The expectation is maintained that the large difference in ionic radii between them likely results in the formation of a novel compound. Consequently, Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 with a 1D zigzag chain structure is discovered. This material exhibits blue emission (&#8776;462&#160;nm) with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield of 95%. An electronic structure calculation reveals that the localized nature of the valence band maximum is crucial in obtaining efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. Moreover, the iodine&#8208;bridged 1D connectivity significantly enhances the chemical stability of Cs5Cu3Cl6I2, compared with the pure chloride phase. The present findings provide a new perspective for developing air&#8208;stable alkali copper(I) halides with highly efficient luminescence.

      <title>Charging Reactions Promoted by Geometrically Necessary Dislocations in Battery Materials Revealed by In Situ Single&#8208;Particle Synchrotron Measurements</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystallographic defects are spatially identified and statistically quantified from over 10 000 Laue X&#8208;ray microdiffraction patterns in many layered oxide particles. The single&#8208;particle, multimodal synchrotron measurements reveal that particles with a higher concentration of geometrically necessary dislocations provide deeper charging reactions, indicating that dislocations may facilitate redox reactions in layered oxides.








Abstract
Crystallographic defects exist in many redox active energy materials, e.g., battery and catalyst materials, which significantly alter their chemical properties for energy storage and conversion. However, there is lack of quantitative understanding of the interrelationship between crystallographic defects and redox reactions. Herein, crystallographic defects, such as geometrically necessary dislocations, are reported to influence the redox reactions in battery particles through single&#8208;particle, multimodal, and in situ synchrotron measurements. Through Laue X&#8208;ray microdiffraction, many crystallographic defects are spatially identified and statistically quantified from a large quantity of diffraction patterns in many layered oxide particles, including geometrically necessary dislocations, tilt boundaries, and mixed defects. The in situ and ex situ measurements, combining microdiffraction and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy imaging, reveal that LiCoO2 particles with a higher concentration of geometrically necessary dislocations provide deeper charging reactions, indicating that dislocations may facilitate redox reactions in layered oxides during initial charging. The present study illustrates that a precise control of crystallographic defects and their distribution can potentially promote and homogenize redox reactions in battery materials.

Abstract
A series of glycolated polythiophenes for use in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is designed and synthesized, differing in the distribution of their ethylene glycol chains that are tethered to the conjugated backbone. While side chain redistribution does not have a significant impact on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers, this molecular engineering strategy strongly impacts the water uptake achieved in the polymers. By careful optimization of the water uptake in the polymer films, OECTs with unprecedented steady&#8208;state performances in terms of [&#956;C*] and current retentions up to 98% over 700 electrochemical switching cycles are developed.

      <title>Mechanical and Tribological Performances Enhanced by Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by nacre and bones, an effective fabrication method for enhancing the mechanical and tribological performances of self&#8208;assembled structures is reported via two strategies. First, a progressive interfacial sliding resistance is thought to be a source of strength and deformation hardening. Second, regulating the building blocks with an amorphous microstructure means they are harder and tougher than those that are single crystalline.








Abstract
Taking inspiration from natural materials, composite materials can be reinforced by creating matrix architectures that can better accommodate and control internal stresses. Despite the recent success in the synthesis of artificial assemblies for local reinforcement through the introduction of oriented fibers and plates into host multilayered composites, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the factors that determine mechanical properties. Moreover, designing building blocks and interfaces that facilitate higher resistance and energy dissipation is highly challenging. When the intrinsic material is fixed, the mechanical and tribological properties can be further adjusted. In this study, europium oxide nanosheets are arranged in interlocked&#8208;junction superstructures that resist sliding at junction points, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the nanosheet assemblies compared to those of the conventional face&#8208;to&#8208;face superstructures formed by parallel nanosheets. Furthermore, the crystalline origin of building blocks is revealed by demonstrating that faulty crystal nanosheets adopting an amorphous structure are different from single&#8208;crystal nanosheets, with the former exhibiting superior mechanical reinforcement and improved abrasive resistance.

      <title>The Bulk Heterojunction in Organic Photovoltaic, Photodetector, and Photocatalytic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of the bulk heterojunction, in terms of materials design, device engineering, and the underpinning physical understanding, has led to significant improvements in organic photovoltaics. Looking forward, the bulk heterojunction concept is likely to allow even greater solar cell efficiencies and interestingly, can be applied to other organic electronic applications, such as organic photodetectors and photocatalysts.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors require an energetic offset in order to photogenerate free charge carriers efficiently, owing to their inability to effectively screen charges. This is vitally important in order to achieve high power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells. Early heterojunction&#8208;based solar cells were limited to relatively modest efficiencies (&lt;4%) owing to limitations such as poor exciton dissociation, limited photon harvesting, and high recombination losses. The development of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) has significantly overcome these issues, resulting in dramatic improvements in organic photovoltaic performance, now exceeding 18% power conversion efficiencies. Here, the design and engineering strategies used to develop the optimal bulk heterojunction for solar&#8208;cell, photodetector, and photocatalytic applications are discussed. Additionally, the thermodynamic driving forces in the creation and stability of the bulk heterojunction are presented, along with underlying photophysics in these blends. Finally, new opportunities to apply the knowledge accrued from BHJ solar cells to generate free charges for use in promising new applications are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;The development of the bulk heterojunction, in terms of materials design, device engineering, and the underpinning physical understanding, has led to significant improvements in organic photovoltaics. Looking forward, the bulk heterojunction concept is likely to allow even greater solar cell efficiencies and interestingly, can be applied to other organic electronic applications, such as organic photodetectors and photocatalysts.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic semiconductors require an energetic offset in order to photogenerate free charge carriers efficiently, owing to their inability to effectively screen charges. This is vitally important in order to achieve high power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells. Early heterojunction&#8208;based solar cells were limited to relatively modest efficiencies (&amp;lt;4%) owing to limitations such as poor exciton dissociation, limited photon harvesting, and high recombination losses. The development of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) has significantly overcome these issues, resulting in dramatic improvements in organic photovoltaic performance, now exceeding 18% power conversion efficiencies. Here, the design and engineering strategies used to develop the optimal bulk heterojunction for solar&#8208;cell, photodetector, and photocatalytic applications are discussed. Additionally, the thermodynamic driving forces in the creation and stability of the bulk heterojunction are presented, along with underlying photophysics in these blends. Finally, new opportunities to apply the knowledge accrued from BHJ solar cells to generate free charges for use in promising new applications are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Van Hove Singularities: Observation of Electrically Tunable van Hove Singularities in Twisted Bilayer Graphene from NanoARPES (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001656, Jyoti Katoch, S&#248;ran Ulstrup, and co&#8208;workers apply nanoscale angle&#8208;resolved photoemission (nanoARPES) to measure the superlattice van Hove singularity formed by the Dirac cones of twisted bilayer graphene. The photoemission experiment is performed on a device architecture that permits electrostatic tuning of the doping level, revealing the doping dependence of the singularity over a wide energy range.

      <title>Graphene Quantum Dots: Controllable Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Splitting of Graphene Quantum Dots through Oxidation: From Phosphorescence to TADF (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2000936, Seunghyup Yoo, Seokwoo Jeon, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel concept for tuning singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) by oxidation control, which induces a dramatic afterglow transition from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to such afterglow emissions at room&#8208;temperature, which enables multilevel information security.

Thermomechanical patterning of 2D materials into micro/nanostructures with a resolution down to 20 nm is reported by J&#252;rgen Brugger and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001232. A heated scanning nanotip performs the patterning by a combination of heat and local pressure, thereby cleaving chemical bonds of the 2D materials, in concert with the rapid sublimation of the polymer layer underneath.

      <title>Wood and the Activity of Dead Tissue</title>
      <dc:description>
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements by the structural organization of cellulose fibrils. The cellulose fiber orientation determines the response of wood to environmental changes as an active material, thereby processing information and converting energy. Some examples for the harvesting of wood activity as well as bioinspiration are discussed.








Abstract
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements. The microarchitecture of cellulose fibrils determines the mechanical properties of woody materials, as well as their actuation properties, based on absorption and desorption of water. Herein it is argued that cellulose fiber orientation corresponds to an analog code that determines the response of wood to humidity as an active material. Examples for the harvesting of wood activity, as well as bioinspiration, are given.

      <title>Multiple Mechanical Gradients are Responsible for the Strong Adhesion of Spider Attachment Hair</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured adhesive hair on the feet of spiders is responsible for strong adhesion, enabling the animals to walk upside down. Using scanning nanofocus X&#8208;ray scattering under force control, the mechanism of alignment and consequently intimate contact, leading to adhesion of the nanostructures to a surface, is examined. The results show excellent adaptation of the biological structures for their specific function.








Abstract
Wandering spiders climb vertically and walk upside&#8208;down on rough and smooth surfaces using a nanostructured attachment system on their feet. The spiders are assumed to adhere by intermolecular van der Waals forces between the adhesive structures and the substrate. The adhesive elements are arranged highly ordered on the hierarchically structured attachment hair (setae). While walking, it has been suggested that the spiders apply a shear force on their legs to increase friction. However, the detailed mechanical behavior of the hair's structures during attachment and detachment remains unknown. Here, gradients of the mechanical properties of the attachment hair on different length scales that have evolved to support attachment, stabilize adhesion in contact, and withstand high stress at detachment, examined by in situ experiments, are shown. Shearing helps to self&#8208;align the adhesive elements with the substrate. The study is anticipated to contribute to the development of optimized artificial dry adhesives.

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Local Modification of High&#8208;Tc Superconductivity in Few Unit&#8208;Cell Thick Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948;</title>
      <dc:description>
A nondestructive method of patterning high&#8208;temperature superconductivity in few unit&#8208;cell thick Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948; (BSCCO) is developed. Deposition of reactive metals like Cr or Ti on the surface of few unit&#8208;cell thick BSCCO alters the superconductivity in underlying layers by locally depleting oxygen content. Using this technique, superconductivity in BSCCO can be spatially patterned to make superconducting devices like nanowires.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature superconductors (HTSs) are important for potential applications and for understanding the origin of strong correlations. Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948; (BSCCO), a van der Waals material, offers a platform to probe the physics down to a unit&#8208;cell. Guiding the flow of electrons by patterning 2DEGS and oxide heterostructures has brought new functionality and access to new science. Similarly, modifying superconductivity in HTS locally, on a small length scale, is of immense interest for superconducting electronics. A route to modify superconductivity locally by depositing metal on the surface is reported here by transport studies on few unit&#8208;cell thick BSCCO. Deposition of chromium (Cr) on the surface over a selected area of BSCCO results in insulating behavior of the underlying region. Cr locally depletes oxygen in CuO2 planes and disrupts the superconductivity in the layers below. This technique of modifying superconductivity is suitable for making sub&#8208;micrometer superconducting wires and more complex superconducting&#160;devices.

A single&#8208;pixel RGB electrofluorochromic (EFC) device is fabricated based on proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, with remarkable EFC properties, and a prototype of a colorful pixel&#8208;based alphanumeric display is demonstrated. The success of this new exploration provides the possibility of full&#8208;color emission in EFC devices, and widely broadens the EFC system and its applications.








Abstract
With the rapid development of human society, consumer electronics have brought marvelous changes to human daily life, but they are accompanied by the much higher demand of display quality and visual experience. Therefore, ideal conversion among the three primary colors&#8212;red (R), green (G), and blue (B)&#8212;in a single pixel has been a better way to avoid the insurmountable technical barrier of subpixel technology of modern displays. Electrofluorochromic (EFC) materials capable of a novel luminescent switching, open a powerful way to design optoelectronic devices for displays and information storage etc. Colorful EFC devices, especially emitting the ideal three primary colors without subpixel technology, have been a challenge for years. Herein, a long&#8208;awaited single&#8208;pixel device with RGB color is fabricated successfully based on proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. The RGB EFC device exhibits outstanding EFC properties, such as low turn&#8208;on voltage (+1.0 and &#8722;1.0 V), large color gamut, and good stability (500 cycles for each color).

      <title>Devising Materials Manufacturing Toward Lab&#8208;to&#8208;Fab Translation of Flexible Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible electronics have witnessed tremendous progress in academia over the past decade, but their industrial adoption lags behind. To stimulate faster lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation, the current status of flexible electronics is reviewed, critical challenges in materials manufacturing during lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation are identified, and perspectives on research and development that can expedite the translation process are proposed.








Abstract
Flexible electronics have witnessed exciting progress in academia over the past decade, but most of the research outcomes have yet to be translated into products or gain much market share. For mass production and commercialization, industrial adoption of newly developed functional materials and fabrication techniques is a prerequisite. However, due to the disparate features of academic laboratories and industrial plants, translating materials and manufacturing technologies from labs to fabs is notoriously difficult. Therefore, herein, key challenges in the materials manufacturing of flexible electronics are identified and discussed for its lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation, along the four stages in product manufacturing: design, materials supply, processing, and integration. Perspectives on industry&#8208;oriented strategies to overcome some of these obstacles are also proposed. Priorities for action are outlined, including standardization, iteration between basic and applied research, and adoption of smart manufacturing. With concerted efforts from academia and industry, flexible electronics will bring a bigger impact to society as promised.

      <title>Stone&#8211;Wales Defects Cause High Proton Permeability and Isotope Selectivity of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological (vacancy&#8208;free) Stone&#8211;Wales defects significantly lower the penetration barrier for hydrogen through graphene: the proton flow through a seven&#8208;membered ring is a million times higher compared to a ring in the pristine honeycomb lattice, and yields an H&#8208;over&#8208;D selectivity of 7 at ambient condition. These calculated results can explain hydrogen isotope separation on defect&#8208;free graphene.








Abstract
While the isotope&#8208;dependent hydrogen permeability of graphene membranes at ambient condition has been demonstrated, the underlying mechanism has been controversially discussed during the past 5 years. The reported room&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;over&#8208;deuteron (H+&#8208;over&#8208;D+) selectivity is 10, much higher than in any competing method. Yet, it has not been understood how protons can penetrate through graphene membranes&#8212;proposed hypotheses include atomic defects and local hydrogenation.

&lt;p&gt;Topological (vacancy&#8208;free) Stone&#8211;Wales defects significantly lower the penetration barrier for hydrogen through graphene: the proton flow through a seven&#8208;membered ring is a million times higher compared to a ring in the pristine honeycomb lattice, and yields an H&#8208;over&#8208;D selectivity of 7 at ambient condition. These calculated results can explain hydrogen isotope separation on defect&#8208;free graphene.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the isotope&#8208;dependent hydrogen permeability of graphene membranes at ambient condition has been demonstrated, the underlying mechanism has been controversially discussed during the past 5 years. The reported room&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;over&#8208;deuteron (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;over&#8208;D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) selectivity is 10, much higher than in any competing method. Yet, it has not been understood how protons can penetrate through graphene membranes&#8212;proposed hypotheses include atomic defects and local hydrogenation. However, neither can explain both the high permeability and high selectivity of the atomically thin membranes. Here, it is confirmed that ideal graphene is quasi&#8208;impermeable to protons, yet the most common defect in sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbons, the topological Stone&#8211;Wales defect, has a calculated penetration barrier below 1 eV and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;over&#8208;D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity of &#8202;7 at room temperature and, thus, explains all experimental results on graphene membranes that are available to date. The competing explanation, local hydrogenation, which also reduces the penetration barrier, but shows significantly lower isotope selectivity, is challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
In this contribution, rational designed functional peptide&#8208;gold hybrid nanomaterials are reviewed for various applications such as biosensing, targeting, imaging, and so forth, due to their specific molecular interactions. With all advantages of peptide&#8208;gold&#8208;based interactive nano&#8208;approaches, they are promising for future applications in the biomedical domain and beyond, especially in field testing.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively used for decades in biosensing&#8208;related development due to outstanding optical properties. Peptides, as newly realized functional biomolecules, are promising candidates of replacing antibodies, receptors, and substrates for specific molecular interactions. Both peptides and AuNPs are robust and easily synthesized at relatively low cost. Hence, peptide&#8208;AuNP&#8208;based bio&#8208;nano&#8208;technological approaches have drawn increasing interest, especially in the field of molecular targeting, cell imaging, drug delivery, and therapy. Many excellent works in these areas have been reported: demonstrating novel ideas, exploring new targets, and facilitating advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Importantly, some of them also have been employed to address real practical problems, especially in remote and less privileged areas. This contribution focuses on the application of peptide&#8211;gold hybrid nanomaterials for various molecular interactions, especially in biosensing/diagnostics and cell targeting/imaging, as well as for the development of highly active antimicrobial/antifouling coating strategies. Rationally designed peptide&#8211;gold nanomaterials with functional properties are discussed along with future challenges and opportunities.

      <title>Effect of Adventitious Carbon on Pit Formation of Monolayer MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>
In situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements show that pit formation by thermal oxidation is preferentially initiated at the interface between adventitious carbon (C) nanoparticles and monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), rather than only sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the C/MoS2 interface favors the sequential adsorption of oxygen atoms with facile kinetics.








Abstract
Forming pits on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers is desirable for (opto)electrical, catalytic, and biological applications. Thermal oxidation is a potentially scalable method to generate pits on monolayer MoS2, and pits are assumed to preferentially form around undercoordinated sites, such as sulfur vacancies. However, studies on thermal oxidation of MoS2 monolayers have not considered the effect of adventitious carbon (C) that is ubiquitous and interacts with oxygen at elevated temperatures. Herein, the effect of adventitious C on the pit formation on MoS2 monolayers during thermal oxidation is studied. The in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy measurements herein show that pit formation is preferentially initiated at the interface between adventitious C nanoparticles and MoS2, rather than only sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the C/MoS2 interface favors the sequential adsorption of oxygen atoms with facile kinetics. These results illustrate the important role of adventitious C on pit formation on monolayer MoS2.

      <title>Magnetic Skyrmions in a Hall Balance with Interfacial Canted Magnetizations</title>
      <dc:description>
N&#233;el&#8208;type skyrmions at zero field and room temperature are experimentally observed using Lorentz&#8208;TEM in a Hall balance with core structure of [Co/Pt]n/NiO/[Co/Pt]n. Interfacial canted magnetizations across NiO spacer give rise to the nucleation of high&#8208;density skyrmions under pulsed current, which shows a strong dependence on interlayer exchange coupling. The Physical mechanism of the skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is presented.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are attracting interest as efficient information&#8208;storage devices with low energy consumption, and have been experimentally and theoretically investigated in multilayers including ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets. The 3D spin texture of skyrmions demonstrated in ferromagnetic multilayers provides a powerful pathway for understanding the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions. However, the manipulation mechanism of skyrmions in antiferromagnets is still lacking. A Hall balance with a ferromagnet/insulating spacer/ferromagnet structure is considered to be a promising candidate to study skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets. Here, high&#8208;density N&#233;el&#8208;type skyrmions are experimentally observed at zero field and room temperature by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in a Hall balance (core structure [Co/Pt]n/NiO/[Co/Pt]n) with interfacial canted magnetizations because of interlayer ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between top and bottom [Co/Pt]n multilayers, where the Co layers in [Co/Pt]n are always ferromagnetically coupled. Micromagnetic simulations show that the generation and density of skyrmions are strongly dependent on interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) and easy&#8208;axis orientation. Direct experimental evidence of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is provided, suggesting that the proposed approach offers a promising alternative mechanism for room&#8208;temperature spintronics.

      <title>Calendering&#8208;Compatible Macroporous Architecture for Silicon&#8211;Graphite Composite toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a gap between lithium&#8208;ion batteries in academia and industry, which is the lack of consideration of industrial requirements in terms of electrode conditions, such as calendering. In this work, a calendering&#8208;compatible macroporous design is presented. This unique design enables both high electrode density without any collapse of pores and an excellent energy density with good cycle life under practical conditions.








Abstract
Porous strategies based on nanoengineering successfully mitigate several problems related to volume expansion of alloying anodes. However, practical application of porous alloying anodes is challenging because of limitations such as calendering incompatibility, low mass loading, and excessive usage of nonactive materials, all of which cause a lower volumetric energy density in comparison with conventional graphite anodes. In particular, during calendering, porous structures in alloying&#8208;based composites easily collapse under high pressure, attenuating the porous characteristics. Herein, this work proposes a calendering&#8208;compatible macroporous architecture for a Si&#8211;graphite anode to maximize the volumetric energy density. The anode is composed of an elastic outermost carbon covering, a nonfilling porous structure, and a graphite core. Owing to the lubricative properties of the elastic carbon covering, the macroporous structure coated by the brittle Si nanolayer can withstand high pressure and maintain its porous architecture during electrode calendering. Scalable methods using mechanical agitation and chemical vapor deposition are adopted. The as&#8208;prepared composite exhibits excellent electrochemical stability of &gt;3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2, with mitigated electrode expansion. Furthermore, full&#8208;cell evaluation shows that the composite achieves higher energy density (932 Wh L&#8722;1) and higher specific energy (333 Wh kg&#8722;1) with stable cycling than has been reported in previous studies.

      <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Magnetization Switching in MoTe2/Permalloy Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies. The observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 adjacent to permalloy is reported.

Abstract
The ability to switch magnetic elements by spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;induced torques has recently attracted much attention for a path toward high&#8208;performance, nonvolatile memories with low power consumption. Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and novel physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies, thus making the choice of spin source crucial. Here, the observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 adjacent to permalloy is reported. Deterministic switching is achieved without external magnetic fields at room temperature, and the switching occurs with currents one order of magnitude smaller than those typical in devices using the best&#8208;performing heavy metals. The thickness&#8208;dependence can be understood if the interfacial spin&#8208;orbit contribution is considered in addition to the bulk spin Hall effect. Further threefold reduction in the switching current is demonstrated with resort to dumbbell&#8208;shaped magnetic elements.

     alt="Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Magnetization Switching in MoTe2/Permalloy Heterostructures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies. The observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adjacent to permalloy is reported. Deterministic switching is achieved without external magnetic fields at room temperature with currents one order of magnitude smaller than those using heavy metals.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to switch magnetic elements by spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;induced torques has recently attracted much attention for a path toward high&#8208;performance, nonvolatile memories with low power consumption. Realizing efficient spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;based switching requires the harnessing of both new materials and novel physics to obtain high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiencies, thus making the choice of spin source crucial. Here, the observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in bilayers consisting of a semimetallic film of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adjacent to permalloy is reported. Deterministic switching is achieved without external magnetic fields at room temperature, and the switching occurs with currents one order of magnitude smaller than those typical in devices using the best&#8208;performing heavy metals. The thickness&#8208;dependence can be understood if the interfacial spin&#8208;orbit contribution is considered in addition to the bulk spin Hall effect. Further threefold reduction in the switching current is demonstrated with resort to dumbbell&#8208;shaped magnetic elements. These findings foretell exciting prospects of using MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for low&#8208;power semimetal&#8208;material&#8208;based spin devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autonomous Surface Reconciliation of a Liquid&#8208;Metal Conductor Micropatterned on a Deformable Hydrogel</title>
      <dc:description>
Micropatternable, super&#8208;stretchable, self&#8208;healable, and water&#8208;swellable liquid&#8208;metal electrodes are developed with a low resistance of &#8776;2 and &#8776;4.6 &#937; at strains of 0% and 1500%, respectively, with low variation in conductance (a variation factor of &#8776;2.3) by utilizing autonomous surface reconciliation of EGaIn on chemically modified hydrogels. These electrodes are suitable for a variety of deformable microelectronic applications.








Abstract
Spreading liquid droplets on solid surfaces is a core topic in physical chemistry with significant technological implications. Liquid metals, which are eutectic alloys of constituent metal atoms with low melting temperatures, are practically useful, but difficult to spread on solid surfaces because of their high surface tension. This makes it difficult to use liquid metals as deformable on&#8208;board microcircuitry electrodes, despite their intrinsic deformability. In this study, it is discovered that eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn) can be spread onto the surface of chemically cross&#8208;linked hydrogels consisting of aliphatic alkyl chains with numerous hydroxyl groups (&#63743;OH), thus facilitating the development of directly micropatterned EGaIn electrodes. More importantly, EGaIn patterned on a hydrogel autonomously reconciliates its surface to form a firm hydrogel interface upon mechanical deformation of the hydrogel. This autonomous surface reconciliation of EGaIn on hydrogels allows researchers to reap the benefits of chemically modified hydrogels, such as reversible stretching, self&#8208;healing, and water&#8208;swelling capability, thereby facilitating the fabrication of superstretchable, self&#8208;healable, and water&#8208;swellable liquid&#8208;metal electrodes with very high conductance tolerance upon deformation. Such electrodes are suitable for a variety of deformable microelectronic applications.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Colossal Magnetoresistance in Terraced Single&#8208;Layer Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
Terraced graphene, formed by laminating single&#8208;layer graphene on a terraced substrate, shows a colossal magnetoresistance of up to 5000% at 9 T and 300&#160;K. The magnetoresistance enhancement is attributed to the topographic corrugations and inhomogeneous charge puddles induced by the terraced structure. The concept of inducing colossal magnetoresistance by stepped surfaces is certainly boosting room&#8208;temperature graphene magnetic sensors.








Abstract
Disorder&#8208;induced magnetoresistance (MR) effect is quadratic at low perpendicular magnetic fields and linear at high fields. This effect is technologically appealing, especially in 2D materials such as graphene, since it offers potential applications in magnetic sensors with nanoscale spatial resolution. However, it is a great challenge to realize a graphene magnetic sensor based on this effect because of the difficulty in controlling the spatial distribution of disorder and enhancing the MR sensitivity in the single&#8208;layer regime. Here, a room&#8208;temperature colossal MR of up to 5000% at 9 T is reported in terraced single&#8208;layer graphene. By laminating single&#8208;layer graphene on a terraced substrate, such as TiO2&#8208;terminated SrTiO3, a universal one order of magnitude enhancement in the MR compared to conventional single&#8208;layer graphene devices is demonstrated. Strikingly, a colossal MR of &gt;1000% is also achieved in the terraced graphene even at a high carrier density of &#8776;1012 cm&#8722;2. Systematic studies of the MR of single&#8208;layer graphene on various oxide&#8208; and non&#8208;oxide&#8208;based terraced surfaces demonstrate that the terraced structure is the dominant factor driving the MR enhancement. The results open a new route for tailoring the physical property of 2D materials by engineering the strain through a terraced substrate.

      <title>Tocilizumab&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles for NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Therapy of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
      <dc:description>
The US Food and Drug Administration approved antirheumatic targeted drug tocilizumab (TCZ) is conjugated to polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) to develop TCZ&#8208;PNPs for near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TCZ&#8208;PNPs&#8208;assisted NIR&#8208;II PA molecular imaging shows that TCZ&#8208;PNPs have excellent RA specificity and significant suppression effect, which provides a new strategy for RA theranostics and therapeutic monitoring.








Abstract
The progressive debilitating nature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) combined with its unknown etiology and initial similarity to other inflammatory diseases makes early diagnosis a significant challenge. Early recognition and treatment of RA is essential for achieving effective therapeutic outcome. NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging (PMI) is emerging as a promising new strategy for effective diagnosis and treatment guidance of RA, owing to its high sensitivity and specificity at large penetration depth. Herein, an antirheumatic targeted drug tocilizumab (TCZ) is conjugated to polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) to develop the first NIR&#8208;II theranostic nanoplatform, named TCZ&#8208;PNPs, for PA&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided therapy of RA. The TCZ&#8208;PNPs are demonstrated to have strong NIR&#8208;II extinction coefficient, high photostability and excellent biocompatibility. NIR&#8208;II PMI results reveal the excellent targeting abilities of TCZ&#8208;PNPs for the effective noninvasive diagnosis of RA joint tissue with a high signal&#8208;to noise ratio (SNR) of 35.8 dB in 3D PA tomography images. Remarkably, one&#8208;month treatment and PA monitoring using TCZ&#8208;PNPs shows RA is significantly suppressed. In addition, the therapeutic evaluation of RA mice by NIR&#8208;II PMI is shown to be consistent with clinical micro&#8208;CT and histological analysis. The TCZ&#8208;PNPs&#8208;assisted NIR&#8208;II PMI provides a new strategy for RA theranostics, therapeutic monitoring and the beyond.

      <title>A Moisture&#8208;Hungry Copper Complex Harvesting Air Moisture for Potable Water and Autonomous Urban Agriculture</title>
      <dc:description>
A moisture&#8208;hungry Cu&#8208;complex is synthesized and used for fabricating a SmartFarm device that can harvest atmospheric water during the nighttime and release water during the daytime under natural sunlight. The device enables self&#8208;sustainable and autonomous irrigation to alleviate both water and food scarcity.








Abstract
The earth's atmosphere houses an enormous amount of water, which could be effectively exploited for a plethora of applications. While the development of materials for harnessing this abundant resource has gained impetus in recent years, limited efforts have been devoted to in&#8208;depth research on their agricultural applications. Herein, a novel copper(II)&#8211;ethanolamine complex (Cu&#8208;complex), which has a maximum water uptake of up to 300% and a water production rate of 2.24 g g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight, is reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, using this material, a fully automated and self&#8208;sustainable solar&#8208;powered SmartFarm device is developed. The Cu&#8208;complex harvests atmospheric water during the night, stores the adsorbed water within, and efficiently releases the adsorbed water during the day when the device is exposed to sunlight. The water harvesting and irrigation process can be fine&#8208;tuned to suit different types of plants and local climates for an optimal cultivation. With the SmartFarm in operation, the demand for freshwater for irrigation could be greatly reduced and urban farming techniques such as large&#8208;scale rooftop farming could be promoted with a view of alleviating both water and food scarcity in the near future.

      <title>Chiral Transition Metal Oxides: Synthesis, Chiral Origins, and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
Transition metal oxides with induced chirality have revolutionized the area of chiroptics and motifs of fundamental research on chiral origin of inorganic nanomaterials with chiral morphologies or chiral interactions with the environment, demonstrating capacities of such unique classes of nano&#8208; to microscale materials for the applications in environmental remediation, stereoselective synthesis, and biological science.








Abstract

      <title>Aggregate Science: From Structures to Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
The study of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) creates many aggregate&#8208;related research branches in which the structures and properties are quite different from those of their molecular components. By virtue of the emerging AIE research, the concept of &#8220;aggregate science&#8221; is proposed to fill the gap between molecules and aggregates, meanwhile providing a general platform for academic research at the mesoscale.








Abstract
Molecular science entails the study of structures and properties of materials at the level of single molecules or small interacting complexes of molecules. Moving beyond single molecules and well&#8208;defined complexes, aggregates (i.e., irregular clusters of many molecules) serve as a particularly useful form of materials that often display modified or wholly new properties compared to their molecular components. Some unique structures and phenomena such as polymorphic aggregates, aggregation&#8208;induced symmetry breaking, and cluster excitons are only identified in aggregates, as a few examples of their exotic features. Here, by virtue of the flourishing research on aggregation&#8208;induced emission, the concept of &#8220;aggregate science&#8221; is put forward to fill the gaps between molecules and aggregates. Structures and properties on the aggregate scale are also systematically summarized. The structure&#8211;property relationships established for aggregates are expected to contribute to new materials and technological development. Ultimately, aggregate science may become an interdisciplinary research field and serves as a general platform for academic research.

      <title>Thiol&#8208;Branched Solid Polymer Electrolyte Featuring High Strength, Toughness, and Lithium Ionic Conductivity for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A thiol&#8208;branched SPE is synthesized to decouple ionic conductivity and mechanic strength and it features high mechanical strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the SPE is also endowed with the functions of both enabling fast Li+ transport and blocking Li dendrite growth, thereby guaranteeing a high stability in battery cycling.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy densities are highly desirable for energy storage, but generally suffer from dendrite growth and side reactions in liquid electrolytes; thus the need for solid electrolytes with high mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and compatible interface arises. Herein, a thiol&#8208;branched solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is introduced featuring high Li+ conductivity (2.26 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature) and good mechanical strength (9.4 MPa)/toughness (&#8776;500%), thus unblocking the tradeoff between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness in polymer electrolytes. The SPE (denoted as M&#8208;S&#8208;PEGDA) is fabricated by covalently cross&#8208;linking metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), tetrakis (3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid) pentaerythritol (PETMP), and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) via multiple C&#63743;S&#63743;C bonds. The SPE also exhibits a high electrochemical window (&gt;5.4 V), low interfacial impedance (&lt;550 &#937;), and impressive Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.44). As a result, Li||Li symmetrical cells with the thiol&#8208;branched SPE displayed a high stability in a &gt;1300 h cycling test. Moreover, a Li|M&#8208;S&#8208;PEGDA|LiFePO4 full cell demonstrates discharge capacity of 143.7 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintains 85.6% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, displaying one of the most outstanding performances for SPEs to date.

      <title>Emergent Nonreciprocal Circularly Polarized Emission from an Organic Thin Film</title>
      <dc:description>
The thin film of a chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenylene derivative emits circularly polarized (CP) light with a high degree of dissymmetry and opposite handedness from the two opposite faces of the film. Nonreciprocal CP emission is unreported so far, and it offers new opportunities in the design of CP emitting materials.








Abstract
Controlling circularly polarized (CP) emission is key for both fundamental understanding and applications in the field of chiral photonics and electronics. Here, a completely new way to achieve this goal is presented. A luminescent thin film, made from a chiral conjugated phenylene bis&#8208;thiophenylpropynone able to self&#8208;assemble into ordered structures, emits highly circularly polarized light with opposite handedness from its two opposite faces. Such emergent nonreciprocal behavior in CP emission, so far unprecedented, represents a fundamental advance, opening new opportunities in design, preparation, and applications of CP emitting materials.

      <title>Large Switchable Photoconduction within 2D Potential Well of a Layered Ferroelectric Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
Coexistence of a 2D potential well and robust ferroelectric polarization is achieved in layered&#8208;perovskite Bi2WO6, leading to a large and stable photocurrent density in an artificially designed photosensitive Bi2WO6/SrTiO3 heterostructure. Such a prototype device shows a great potential for applications in high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic cells and nonvolatile information processing with low power consumption.








Abstract
The coexistence of large conductivity and robust ferroelectricity is promising for high&#8208;performance ferroelectric devices based on polarization&#8208;controllable highly efficient carrier transport. Distinct from traditional perovskite ferroelectrics, Bi2WO6 with a layered structure shows a great potential to preserve its ferroelectricity under substantial electron doping. Herein, by artificial design of photosensitive heterostructures with desired band alignment, three orders of magnitude enhancement of the short&#8208;circuit photocurrent is achieved in Bi2WO6/SrTiO3 at room temperature. The microscopic mechanism of this large photocurrent originates from separated transport of electrons and holes in [WO4]&#8722;2 and [Bi2O2]+2 layers respectively with a large in&#8208;plane conductivity, which is understood by a combination of ab initio calculations and spectroscopic measurements. The layered electronic structure and appropriately designed band alignment in this layered ferroelectric heterostructure provide an opportunity to achieve high&#8208;performance and nonvolatile switchable electronic devices.

      <dc:description>
DNA micro&#8208;disks, QR&#8208;coded micro&#8208;sized disks that harbor data&#8208;encoded DNA molecules for the efficient management of DNA&#8208;based data storage are proposed. Using these DNA micro&#8208;disks, data items can be efficiently accessed by indexing the data&#8208;encoded DNA library and write&#8208;once&#8211;read&#8208;many (WORM) memory can be demonstrated through in situ DNA production on the DNA micro&#8208;disks.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based data storage has attracted attention because of its higher physical density of the data and longer retention time than those of conventional digital data storage. However, previous DNA&#8208;based data storage lacked index features and the data quality of storage after a single access was not preserved, obstructing its industrial use. Here, DNA micro&#8208;disks, QR&#8208;coded micro&#8208;sized disks that harbor data&#8208;encoded DNA molecules for the efficient management of DNA&#8208;based data storage, are proposed. The two major features that previous DNA&#8208;based data&#8208;storage studies could not achieve are demonstrated. One feature is accessing data items efficiently by indexing the data&#8208;encoded DNA library. Another is achieving write&#8208;once&#8211;read&#8208;many (WORM) memory through the immobilization of DNA molecules on the disk and their enrichment through in situ DNA production. Through these features, the reliability of DNA&#8208;based data storage is increased by allowing selective and multiple accession of data&#8208;encoded DNA with lower data loss than previous DNA&#8208;based data storage methods.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA&#8208;based data storage has attracted attention because of its higher physical density of the data and longer retention time than those of conventional digital data storage. However, previous DNA&#8208;based data storage lacked index features and the data quality of storage after a single access was not preserved, obstructing its industrial use. Here, DNA micro&#8208;disks, QR&#8208;coded micro&#8208;sized disks that harbor data&#8208;encoded DNA molecules for the efficient management of DNA&#8208;based data storage, are proposed. The two major features that previous DNA&#8208;based data&#8208;storage studies could not achieve are demonstrated. One feature is accessing data items efficiently by indexing the data&#8208;encoded DNA library. Another is achieving write&#8208;once&#8211;read&#8208;many (WORM) memory through the immobilization of DNA molecules on the disk and their enrichment through in situ DNA production. Through these features, the reliability of DNA&#8208;based data storage is increased by allowing selective and multiple accession of data&#8208;encoded DNA with lower data loss than previous DNA&#8208;based data storage methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced Nanowood Materials for the Water&#8211;Energy Nexus</title>
      <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review on novel nanowood materials and applications related to the water&#8211;energy nexus is presented. The unique structures and properties are highlighted, and how such features are harnessed by nanomanufacturing to enable sustainable water filtration, adsorption, catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as desalination and environmental cleanup, is discussed. Insights are offered on future development to enable a circular water economy.








Abstract
Wood materials are being reinvented to carry superior properties for a variety of new applications. Cutting&#8208;edge nanomanufacturing transforms traditional bulky and low&#8208;value woods into advanced materials that have desired structures, durability, and functions to replace nonrenewable plastics, polymers, and metals. Here, a first prospect report on how novel nanowood materials have been developed and applied in water and associated industries is provided, wherein their unique features and promises are discussed. First, the unique hierarchical structure and associated properties of the material are introduced, and then how such features can be harnessed and modified by either bottom&#8208;up or top&#8208;down manufacturing to enable different functions for water filtration, chemical adsorption and catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as energy&#8208;efficient desalination and environmental cleanup are discussed. The study recognizes that this is a nascent but very promising field; therefore, insights are offered to encourage more research and development. Trees harness solar energy and CO2 and provide abundant carbon&#8208;negative materials. Once harvested and utilized, it is believed that advanced wood materials will play a vital role in enabling a circular water economy.

      <title>Structure&#8211;Transport Correlation Reveals Anisotropic Charge Transport in Coupled PbS Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocrystal superlattices exhibit favored directions for charge transport. Electronic and structural properties of microdomains of coupled PbS nanocrystal superlattices are correlatively investigated by conductivity and X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction measurements. Highly ordered superlattices of iso&#8208;oriented nanocrystals show electrical transport anisotropy, a feature attractive for electronic applications, which has never been experimentally demonstrated for nanocrystal superlattices before.








Abstract
The assembly of colloidal semiconductive nanocrystals into highly ordered superlattices predicts novel structure&#8208;related properties by design. However, those structure&#8211;property relationships, such as charge transport depending on the structure or even directions of the superlattice, have remained unrevealed so far. Here, electric transport measurements and X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction are performed on self&#8208;assembled lead sulfide nanocrystal superlattices to investigate direction&#8208;dependent charge carrier transport in microscopic domains of these materials. By angular X&#8208;ray cross&#8208;correlation analysis, the structure and orientation of individual superlattices is determined, which are directly correlated with the electronic properties of the same microdomains. By that, strong evidence for the effect of superlattice crystallinity on the electric conductivity is found. Further, anisotropic charge transport in highly ordered monocrystalline domains is revealed, which is attributed to the dominant effect of shortest interparticle distance. This implies that transport anisotropy should be a general feature of weakly coupled nanocrystal superlattices.

      <title>Electrochemical Intercalation in Atomically Thin van der Waals Materials for Structural Phase Transition and Device Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on the electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures via versatile electrochemical platforms and their influence on the structural phase transition of materials and novel device applications is reviewed, and the future opportunities especially on the intercalation via solid ion conductor field effect transistors are discussed.








Abstract
In van der Waals (vdWs) materials and heterostructures, the interlayers are bonded by weak vdWs interactions due to the lack of dangling bonds. The vdWs gap at the homo&#8208; or heterointerface provides great freedom to enrich the tunability of electronic structures by external intercalation of foreign ions or atoms at the interface, leading to the discovery of new physics and functionalities. Herein, the recent progress on electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin vdWs materials for structural phase transition and device applications is reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. First, several kinds of electrochemical intercalation platforms to achieve the intercalation in vdWs materials and heterostructures are introduced. Next, the in situ characterization of electrochemical intercalation dynamics by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques is summarized, including optical techniques, scanning probe techniques, and electrical transport. Moreover, particular attention is paid on the experimentally reported phase transition and multifunctional applications of intercalated devices. Finally, future applications and challenges of intercalation in vdWs materials and heterostructures are proposed, including the intrinsic intercalation mechanism of solid ion conductors, exact identification of intercalated foreign species by near&#8208;field optical techniques, and the tunability of intercalation kinetics for ultrafast switching.

      <title>Diode&#8208;Like Selective Enhancement of Carrier Transport through Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Interface Decorated by Monolayer Boron Nitride</title>
      <dc:description>
For the first time, a novel diode&#8208;like selective enhancement of the carrier transport through a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) contact is revealed through a comparison with conventional metal&#8211;semiconductor contact on a single monolayer MoS2 triangular domain. The MIS contact exploits monolayer hexagonal boron nitride as an ultrathin decorating layer added between MoS2 and metal contact.








Abstract
2D semiconductors such as monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are promising material candidates for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, there are fundamental challenges related to their metal&#8211;semiconductor (MS) contacts, which limit the performance potential for practical device applications. In this work, 2D monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is exploited as an ultrathin decorating layer to form a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) contact, and an innovative device architecture is designed as a platform to reveal a novel diode&#8208;like selective enhancement of the carrier transport through the MIS contact. The contact resistance is significantly reduced when the electrons are transported from the semiconductor to the metal, but is barely affected when the electrons are transported oppositely. A concept of carrier collection barrier is proposed to interpret this intriguing phenomenon as well as a negative Schottky barrier height obtained from temperature&#8208;dependent measurements, and the critical role of the collection barrier at the drain end is shown for the overall transistor performance.

      <title>Water Passivation of Perovskite Nanocrystals Enables Air&#8208;Stable Intrinsically Stretchable Color&#8208;Conversion Layers for Stretchable Displays</title>
      <dc:description>
Here, an air&#8208;stable stretchable display consisting of an intrinsically stretchable electroluminescent device and perovskite nanocrystal (PeNCs) stretchable color conversion layer is proposed. Surprisingly, the increase in photoluminescence intensity of PeNCs in the water is proved to be caused by the surface passivation of moisture, which overcomes the water instability of perovskite materials.








Abstract
Conventional organic light&#8208;emitting devices without an encapsulation layer are susceptible to degradation when exposed to air, so realization of air&#8208;stable intrinsically&#8208;stretchable display is a great challenge because the protection of the devices against penetration of moisture and oxygen is even more difficult under stretching. An air&#8208;stable intrinsically&#8208;stretchable display that is composed of an intrinsically&#8208;stretchable electroluminescent device (SELD) integrated with a stretchable color&#8208;conversion layer (SCCL) that contains perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) is proposed. PeNCs normally decay when exposed to air, but they become resistant to this decay when dispersed in a stretchable elastomer matrix; this change is a result of a compatibility between capping ligands and the elastomer matrix. Counterintuitively, the moisture can efficiently passivate surface defects of PeNCs, to yield significant increases in both photoluminescence intensity and lifetime. A display that can be stretched up to 180% is demonstrated; it is composed of an air&#8208;stable SCCL that down&#8208;converts the SELD&#8217;s blue emission and reemits it as green. The work elucidates the basis of moisture&#8208;assisted surface passivation of PeNCs and provides a promising strategy to improve the quantum efficiency of PeNCs with the aid of moisture, which allows PeNCs to be applied for air&#8208;stable stretchable displays.

      <title>Porous Materials Applied in Nonaqueous Li&#8211;O2 Batteries: Status and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
The application of nonaqueous Li&#8211;O2 batteries is limited by challenges from the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte. The perspectives of porous materials for Li&#8211;O2 batteries are outlined, the advances of porous materials for targeting critical battery challenges are highlighted, rational design and future directions of porous&#8208;materials&#8208;based Li&#8211;O2 battery systems are suggested.








Abstract
Porous materials possessing high surface area, large pore volume, tunable pore structure, superior tailorability, and dimensional effect have been widely applied as components of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. Herein, the theoretical foundation of the porous materials applied in Li&#8211;O2 batteries is provided, based on the present understanding of the battery mechanism and the challenges and advantageous qualities of porous materials. Furthermore, recent progress in porous materials applied as the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte in Li&#8211;O2 batteries is summarized, together with corresponding approaches to address the critical issues that remain at present. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of the correlation between the function&#8208;orientated design of porous materials and key challenges of Li&#8211;O2 batteries in accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, improving the electrode stability, controlling lithium deposition, suppressing the shuttle effect of the dissolved redox mediators, and alleviating electrolyte decomposition. Finally, the rational design and innovative directions of porous materials are provided for their development and application in Li&#8211;O2 battery systems.

      <title>Optical Forces: From Fundamental to Biological Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Optical forces form the basis for optical trapping and manipulation and are of critical importance in various disciplines from fundamental research to practical applications. Advances in optical forces have made significant impacts for biological exploration both in vitro and in vivo, with applications from individual manipulation and analysis to multiple assembly and detection.








Abstract
Optical forces, generally arising from changes of field gradients or linear momentum carried by photons, form the basis for optical trapping and manipulation. Advances in optical forces help to reveal the nature of light&#8211;matter interactions, giving answers to a wide range of questions and solving problems across various disciplines, and are still yielding new insights in many exciting sciences, particularly in the fields of biological technology, material applications, and quantum sciences. This review focuses on recent advances in optical forces, ranging from fundamentals to applications for biological exploration. First, the basics of different types of optical forces with new light&#8211;matter interaction mechanisms and near&#8208;field techniques for optical force generation beyond the diffraction limit with nanometer accuracy are described. Optical forces for biological applications from in vitro to in vivo are then reviewed. Applications from individual manipulation to multiple assembly into functional biophotonic probes and soft&#8208;matter superstructures are discussed. At the end future directions for application of optical forces for biological exploration are provided.

      <title>In Search of Chiral Molecular Superconductors: &#954;&#8208;[(S,S)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4 Revisited</title>

The enantiopure mixed valence radical cations salts &#954;&#8208;[(S,S)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4 and &#954;&#8208;[(R,R)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4, prepared by electrocrystallization of the chiral donor DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF, show metallic conductivity but no superconducting transition, unlike the conclusions of an earlier report. Original structural and electronic features consisting in two different &#954;&#8208;type layers having 1D and 2D electronic dimensionality are revealed by structural investigations and band structure calculations.








Abstract
The relationship between chirality and superconductivity is an intriguing question. The two enantiomeric crystalline radical cation salts &#954;&#8208;[(S,S)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4 and &#954;&#8208;[(R,R)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4, showing &#954;&#8208;type arrangement of the organic layers, are investigated in search for superconducting chiral molecular materials following a 1992 report indicating the occurrence of a superconducting transition in the former compound. While the initial interpretation is presently challenged through in&#8208;depth temperature and pressure dependent single crystal resistivity measurements combined with band structure calculations, the two chiral conductors show metal like behavior with room temperature conductivities of 10&#8211;30 S cm&#8722;1 at ambient pressure and stabilization of the metallic state down to the lowest temperatures under moderate pressures. Moreover, their structural and theoretical investigations reveal an original feature, namely the existence of two different &#954; layers with 1D and 2D electronic dimensionality, respectively, as a consequence of an interlayer charge transfer. The resistivity drop observed for one sample below 1 K and insensitive to magnetic field, possibly results from mixing in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane contributions to the measured resistance and suggests current induced charge order melting. This feature contradicts the occurrence of superconductivity in these chiral molecular conductors and leaves open the discovery of the first chiral molecular superconductors.

      <title>De Novo Design of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes toward Ultrafast Anion Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
The de novo design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) afforded dense and ordered alignment of quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized side chains along the intrinsic channels within the frameworks, rendering one of the highest hydroxide conductivities among the ever&#8208;reported anion exchange membranes (AEMs), and demonstrating the feasibility of COFs as the building blocks for high&#8208;performance AEMs.








Abstract
The emergence of all&#8208;organic frameworks is of fundamental significance, and designing such structures for anion conduction holds great promise in energy conversion and storage applications. Herein, inspired by the efficient anion transport within organisms, a de novo design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) toward ultrafast anion transport is demonstrated. A phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process is developed to acquire dense and ordered alignment of quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized side chains along the channels within the frameworks. The resultant self&#8208;standing COFs membranes exhibit one of the highest hydroxide conductivities (212 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C) among the reported anion exchange membranes. Meanwhile, it is found that shorter, more hydrophilic side chains are favorable for anion conduction. The present work highlights the prospects of all&#8208;organic framework materials as the platform building blocks in designing ion exchange membranes and ion sieving membranes.

      <title>Single&#8208;Crystal SnSe Thermoelectric Fibers via Laser&#8208;Induced Directional Crystallization: From 1D Fibers to Multidimensional Fabrics</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal SnSe fibers are achieved using thermal drawing and laser&#8208;induced recrystallization. The resulting single&#8208;crystal rock&#8208;salt SnSe fibers possess high thermoelectric properties, enhancing the ZT value close to 2 at 860 K, while being highly flexible, ultralong, and mechanically stable. This simple and low&#8208;cost approach engages the fiber&#8208;shaped high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal materials in applications from 1D fiber devices to multidimensional wearable fabrics.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal tin selenide (SnSe), a record holder of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials, enables high&#8208;efficient interconversion between heat and electricity for power generation or refrigeration. However, the rigid bulky SnSe cannot satisfy the applications for flexible and wearable devices. Here, a method is demonstrated to achieve ultralong single&#8208;crystal SnSe wire with rock&#8208;salt structure and high thermoelectric performance with diameters from micro&#8208; to nanoscale. This method starts from thermally drawing SnSe into a flexible fiber&#8208;like substrate, which is polycrystalline, highly flexible, ultralong, and mechanically stable. Then a CO2 laser is employed to recrystallize the SnSe core to single&#8208;crystal over the entire fiber. Both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the single&#8208;crystal rock&#8208;salt SnSe fibers possess high thermoelectric properties, significantly enhancing the ZT value to 2 at 862 K. This simple and low&#8208;cost approach offers a promising path to engage the fiber&#8208;shaped single&#8208;crystal materials in applications from 1D fiber devices to multidimensional wearable fabrics.

      <title>Fabricating 3D Metastructures by Simultaneous Modulation of Flexible Resist Stencils and Basal Molds</title>
      <dc:description>
Orthotropic control of resist stencils and basal molds is developed to realize high&#8208;resolution true triaxial fabrication of 3D metastructures. New strategies to modulate the basal mold with high precision are realized by a controlled annealing process. A new alignment technique is also introduced to stacking the 3D metastructures with high addressability.








Abstract
Metamaterials have gained much attention thanks to their extraordinary and intriguing optical properties beyond natural materials. However, universal high&#8208;resolution fabrications of 3D micro/nanometastructures with high&#8208;resolution remain a challenge. Here, a novel approach to fabricate sophisticated 3D micro/nanostructures with excellent robustness and precise controllability is demonstrated by simultaneously modulating of flexible resist stencils and basal molds. This method allows arbitrary manipulations of morphology, size, and orientation, as well as contact angles of the objects. Combined with a new alignment strategy of high&#8208;resolution, previously inaccessible architectures are fabricated with ultrahigh precision, leading to an excellent spectra response from the fabricated metastructures. This method provides a new possibility to realize true 3D metamaterial fabrications featuring high&#8208;resolution and direct&#8208;compatibility with broad planar lithography platforms.

      <title>Large&#8208;Area Alignment of Supramolecular Columns by Photothermal Laser Writing</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular columns of nanoscale periodicity (&#8776;4.75 nm) are aligned in a uniform direction over a large area by photothermal laser writing. The alignment direction of the supramolecular structures is determined by varying the laser heating conditions. Area&#8208;selective alignment is also demonstrated by local laser writing, and planar structures of supramolecular materials along the laser scanning direction at the specified areas are generated.








Abstract
Controlling the orientation of highly periodic supramolecular structures of small feature size (&lt;5 nm) is the first step for potential applications in optoelectronics, membranes, and template synthesis. A new method, namely, laser photothermal writing, is introduced to direct the orientation of supramolecular columns over a large area. Supramolecular columns consisting of taper&#8208;shaped molecules with long aliphatic tail groups are aligned by a thermal gradient, which is induced by exposing a near&#8208;infrared laser beam to a graphene photothermal conversion layer. Intriguingly, the orientation of the supramolecular columns can be controlled in a facile manner by varying the laser scanning velocity and power. In contrast to previous methodologies for aligning supramolecular structures, this laser photothermal mechanism allows the directional and continuous alignment of supramolecular structures over an arbitrary large area with the easy control of laser irradiation. Besides, the laser process also enables area&#8208;selective orientation of the supramolecular structures for device&#8208;oriented nanopatterning.

      <title>Toward Robust Macroscale Superlubricity on Engineering Steel Substrate</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel principle is proposed to assemble numberless &#8220;microscale superlubricity&#8221; into &#8220;macroscale superlubricity,&#8221; where the elaborately constructed micro&#8208;asperities of rough engineering substrate play the role of splitting macro&#8208;surface into micro&#8208;points. Then at each contact point, special measures, such as pre&#8208;running&#8208;in and heterogeneous 2D materials are devised to manipulate the interfacial ordered state, chemical interaction, and incommensurate configuration, thereby achieving robust macroscale superlubricity.








Abstract
&#8220;Structural superlubricity&#8221; is an important fundamental phenomenon in modern tribology that is expected to greatly diminish friction in mechanical engineering, but now is limited to achieve only at nanoscale and microscale in experiment. A novel principle for broadening the structural superlubricating state based on numberless micro&#8208;contact into macroscale superlubricity is demonstrated. The topography of micro&#8208;asperities on engineering steel substrates is elaborately constructed to divide the macroscale surface contact into microscale point contacts. Then at each contact point, special measures such as pre&#8208;running&#8208;in period and coating heterogeneous covalent/ionic or ionic/ionic nanocomposite of 2D materials are devised to manipulate the interfacial ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer state, weak chemical interaction, and incommensurate configuration, thereby satisfying the prerequisites responsible for structural superlubricity. Finally, the robust superlubricating states on engineering steel&#8211;steel macroscale contact pairs are achieved with significantly reduced friction coefficient in 10&#8722;3 magnitude, extra&#8208;long antiwear life (more than 1.0 &#215; 106 laps), and good universality to wide range of materials and loads, which can be of significance for the industrialization of &#8220;structural superlubricity.&#8221;

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Co2P Nanoparticle/Multi&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon as a Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance trifunctional electrocatalyst which is characterized by Co2P nanoparticles embedded in Co, N, and P multi&#8208;doped carbon is developed using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. The synergistic effect of Co2P on multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon substrates provides an excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Developing efficient and low&#8208;cost replacements for precious metals as electrocatalysts active in electrochemical reactions&#8212;the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8212;is a top priority in renewable energy technology. In this work a highly active and very stable trifunctional electrocatalyst composed of Co2P embedded in Co, N, and P multi&#8208;doped carbon has been synthesized using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. The synergistic effects between Co2P and the multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon substrates afford materials having electrocatalytic activities for HER, OER, and ORR, which are comparable&#8212;or even superior to&#8212;those of commercial RuO2 or Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations show that Co2P has a higher density of states at the Fermi level than ConP (0 &lt; n &lt; 2), which promotes electron transfer and intermediates adsorption in the catalytic process. Zinc&#8211;air batteries and water splitting devices assembled using the materials as electrode electrocatalysts show good performance and outstanding stability. This work represents a breakthrough in improving the catalytic performance of non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and ORR, and opens new avenues for clean energy generation.

      <title>Novel Bi&#8208;Doped Amorphous SnOx Nanoshells for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction into Formate at Low Overpotentials</title>
      <dc:description>
The first synthesis of homogeneous Sn1&#8722;xBix alloy nanoparticles (x up to 0.20) is successfully achieved with native Bi atoms&#8208;doped amorphous SnOx nanoshells for highly efficient CO2 reduction into formate, outperforming current tin oxide catalysts.








Abstract
Engineering novel Sn&#8208;based bimetallic materials could provide intriguing catalytic properties to boost the electrochemical CO2 reduction. Herein, the first synthesis of homogeneous Sn1&#8722;xBix alloy nanoparticles (x up to 0.20) with native Bi&#8208;doped amorphous SnOx shells for efficient CO2 reduction is reported. The Bi&#8208;SnOx nanoshells boost the production of formate with high Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90%) over a wide potential window (&#8722;0.67 to &#8722;0.92&#160;V vs RHE) with low overpotentials, outperforming current tin oxide catalysts. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Bi&#8208;SnOx nanoshells derived from Sn0.80Bi0.20 alloy nanoparticles exhibit a great partial current density of 74.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high Faradaic efficiency of 95.8%. The detailed electrocatalytic analyses and corresponding density functional theory calculations simultaneously reveal that the incorporation of Bi atoms into Sn species facilitates formate production by suppressing the formation of H2 and CO.

      <title>Bioinspired Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tumor Parallel Catalytic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an intriguing paradigm of tumor parallel catalytic therapy using bioinspired copper single&#8208;atom catalysts to directly catalyze O2 and H2O2 in parallel into O2&#8226;&#8722; and &#8226;OH, respectively, for the oxidation and damage of target biomolecules without external energy input, which is expected to deliver a novel therapeutic nanoplatform for clinics in the future.








Abstract
The oxidation of intracellular biomolecules by reactive oxygen species (ROS) forms the basis for ROS&#8208;based tumor therapy. However, the current therapeutic modalities cannot catalyze H2O2 and O2 concurrently for ROS generation, thereby leading to unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, it is reported a bioinspired hollow N&#8208;doped carbon sphere doped with a single&#8208;atom copper species (Cu&#8208;HNCS) that can directly catalyze the decomposition of both oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to ROS, namely superoxide ion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) and the hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), respectively, in an acidic tumor microenvironment for the oxidation of intracellular biomolecules without external energy input, thus resulting in an enhanced tumor growth inhibitory effect. Notably, the Fenton reaction turnover frequency of Cu species in Cu&#8208;HNCS is &#8776;5000 times higher than that of Fe in commercial Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high catalytic activity of Cu&#8208;HNCS originates from the single&#8208;atom copper, and the calculation predicts a next&#8208;generation Fenton catalyst. This work provides an effective paradigm of tumor parallel catalytic therapy for considerably enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

      <title>Multiscale Architecture and Superior High&#8208;Temperature Performance of Discontinuously Reinforced Titanium Matrix Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Discontinuously reinforced titanium matrix composites (DRTMCs) by tailoring multiscale architectures have exposed more promising mechanical properties, including comparatively better strengthening effects, exceptional high&#8208;temperature endurability, and most importantly, decent tensile ductility. The most recent developments, including the design, fabrication, microstructure, high&#8208;temperature performance, strengthening mechanisms, and future research opportunities for composites, are reviewed.








Abstract
Discontinuously reinforced titanium matrix composites (DRTMCs), as one of the most important metal matrix composites (MMCs), are expected to exhibit high strength, elastic modulus, high&#8208;temperature endurability, wear resistance, isotropic property, and formability. Recent innovative research shows that tailoring the reinforcement network distribution totally differently from the conventional homogeneous distribution can not only improve the strengthening effect but also resolve the dilemma of DRTMCs with poor tensile ductility. Based on the network architecture, multiscale architecture, for example, two&#8208;scale network and laminate&#8208;network microstructure can further inspire superior strength, creep, and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Herein, the most recent developments, which include the design, fabrication, microstructure, high&#8208;temperature performance, strengthening mechanisms, and future research opportunities for DRTMCs with multiscale architecture, are captured. In this regard, the service temperature can be increased by 200 &#176;C, and the creep rupture time by 59&#8208;fold compared with those of conventional titanium alloys, which can meet the urgent demands of lightweight nickel&#8208;based structural materials and potentially replace nickel base superalloys at 600&#8211;800 &#176;C to reduce weight by 45%. In fact, multiscale architecture design strategy will also favorably open a new era in the research of extensive metallic materials for improved performances.

      <title>Giant and Broadband Multiphoton Absorption Nonlinearities of a 2D Organometallic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
      <dc:description>
Giant and broadband multiphoton absorption effects are presented in 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, which exhibits a record&#8208;high five&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;132 cm10 s4 photon&#8722;4, exceeding all the known ferroelectrics and being about 10 orders larger than some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecules. This makes a breakthrough in ferroelectrics for newly conceptual photonic device applications.








Abstract
Multiphoton absorption (MPA) has been utilized for important technological applications. High&#8208;order multiphoton harvesting (e.g., five&#8208;photon absorption, 5PA) exhibits unique properties that could benefit biophotonics. Within this field, perovskite oxide ferroelectrics (e.g., BaTiO3) enable low&#8208;order optical nonlinearities of 2PA/3PA processes. However, it is challenging to obtain efficient, high&#8208;order 5PA effects. Herein, for the first time, giant and broadband MPA properties are presented in the 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (IA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 (1; IA = isoamylammonium and MA = methylammonium), where multiphoton&#8208;excited optical nonlinearities related to different MPA mechanisms over a broadband range of 550&#8211;2400 nm are observed. Strikingly, its 5PA absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;5) reaches up to 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;132 cm10 s4 photon&#8722;4 (at 2400 nm), almost 10 orders larger than some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecules and a record&#8208;high value among all known ferroelectrics. This unprecedented 5PA effect results from the quantum&#8208;confined motif of inorganic trilayer sheets (wells) and organic cations (barriers) in 1. Moreover, its large ferroelectric polarization of 5 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 could promote modulation of MPA effects under external electric fields. As far as it is known, this is the first report on giant, broadband high&#8208;order MPA properties in ferroelectrics, which provides potential, novel electric&#8208;ordered materials for next&#8208;generation biophotonic applications.

Abstract
Owing to the promise of high safety and energy density, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are attracting incremental interest as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their widespread applications are inhibited by many technical challenges, including low&#8208;conductivity electrolytes, dendrite growth, and poor cycle/rate properties. Particularly, the interfacial dynamics between the solid electrolyte and the electrode is considered as a crucial factor in determining solid&#8208;state battery performance.

      <title>Tough and Multi&#8208;Recyclable Cross&#8208;Linked Supramolecular Polyureas via Incorporating Noncovalent Bonds into Main&#8208;Chains</title>
      <dc:description>
A new strategy of incorporating noncovalent bonds into main&#8208;chains is developed to construct tough and multi&#8208;recyclable cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polyureas (CSPU). After five generations of recycling processes, the mechanical properties of reprocessed CSPU can recover more than 95% of their original properties. Overall, CSPU exhibit the superior toughness, remarkable solvent resistance, high transparency, and excellent multiple recyclability.








Abstract
Covalent thermosets generally exhibit robust mechanical properties, while they are fragile and lack the ability to be reprocessed or recycled. Herein, a new strategy of incorporating noncovalent bonds into main&#8208;chains is developed to construct tough and multi&#8208;recyclable cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polyureas (CSPU), which are prepared via the copolymerization of diisocyanate monomers, noncovalently bonded diamine monomers linked by quadruple hydrogen bonds, and covalent diamine/triamine monomers. The CSPU exhibit remarkable solvent resistance and outstanding mechanical properties owing to the covalent cross&#8208;linking via triamine monomer. Through the incorporation of 9.7% and 14.6% quadruple hydrogen bonded diamine monomer, the transparent CSPU films are endowed with superior toughness of 74.17 and 124.17 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, respectively. Impressively, even after five generations of recycling processes, the mechanical properties of reprocessed CSPU can recover more than 95% of their original properties, displaying excellent multiple recyclablity. As a result, the superior toughness, remarkable solvent resistance, high transparency, and excellent multiple recyclability are well&#8208;combined in the CSPU. It is highly anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile and general method to construct various cross&#8208;linked polymer materials with superior recyclability and mechanical properties.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent thermosets generally exhibit robust mechanical properties, while they are fragile and lack the ability to be reprocessed or recycled. Herein, a new strategy of incorporating noncovalent bonds into main&#8208;chains is developed to construct tough and multi&#8208;recyclable cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polyureas (CSPU), which are prepared via the copolymerization of diisocyanate monomers, noncovalently bonded diamine monomers linked by quadruple hydrogen bonds, and covalent diamine/triamine monomers. The CSPU exhibit remarkable solvent resistance and outstanding mechanical properties owing to the covalent cross&#8208;linking via triamine monomer. Through the incorporation of 9.7% and 14.6% quadruple hydrogen bonded diamine monomer, the transparent CSPU films are endowed with superior toughness of 74.17 and 124.17 MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Impressively, even after five generations of recycling processes, the mechanical properties of reprocessed CSPU can recover more than 95% of their original properties, displaying excellent multiple recyclablity. As a result, the superior toughness, remarkable solvent resistance, high transparency, and excellent multiple recyclability are well&#8208;combined in the CSPU. It is highly anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile and general method to construct various cross&#8208;linked polymer materials with superior recyclability and mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
