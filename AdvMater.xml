The 3D nanocomposite structure of the plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside LiMetal is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
The 3D nanocomposite structure of plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside amorphous Li matrix, is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. With ether&#8208;based DOLDME&#8208;LiTFSI electrolyte, LiF and Li2O nanocrystals are formed and embedded in a thin but tough amorphous polymer in the SEI exoskeleton. The fast Li&#8208;stripping directions are along [1&#175;10] or [121&#175;], which produces eight exposed {111} planes at halfway charging. Full Li stripping produces completely sagging, empty SEI husks that can sustain large bending and buckling, with the smallest bending radius of curvature observed approaching tens of nanometers without apparent damage. In the 2nd round of Li plating, a thin LiBCC sheet first nucleates at the current collector, extends to the top end of the deflated SEI husk, and then expands its thickness. The apparent zero wetting angle between LiBCC and the SEI interior means that the heterogeneous nucleation energy barrier is zero. Due to its complete&#8208;wetting property and chemo&#8208;mechanical stability, the SEI largely prevents further reactions between the Li metal and the electrolyte, which explains the superior performance of Li&#8208;metal batteries with ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, uneven refilling of the SEI husks results in dendrite protrusions and some new SEI formation during the 2nd plating. A strategy to form bigger SEI capsules during the initial cycle with higher energy density than the following cycles enables further enhanced Coulombic efficiency to above 99%.

         <title>Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating electron spin resonance capability in spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, quantum states of individual spins on surfaces can be initialized, controlled, and read out. Individual spins and artificial spin structures built atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom provide new platforms for sensing magnetic interactions, performing quantum operations, and simulating spin Hamiltonians at the atomic scale.








Abstract
The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all&#8208;electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically&#8208;precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic&#160;scale.

         <title>Cascade&#8208;Targeting Poly(amino acid) Nanoparticles Eliminate Intracellular Bacteria via On&#8208;Site Antibiotic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade&#8208;targeting drug delivery system (DDS) based on mannose&#8208;decorated poly(&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;phenylalanine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;aminoalanine) is proposed. The DDS targets macrophages and intracellular MRSA in a cascade manner, going through a procedure of macrophages&#8208;specific endocytosis, lysosome escape, intracellular methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus targeting, and on&#8208;site rifampicin release. The DDS shows a distinguished performance for eliminating intracellular MRSA regardless of their latent or dormant states.








Abstract
Intracellular bacteria in latent or dormant states tolerate high&#8208;dose antibiotics. Fighting against these opportunistic bacteria has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, the design of a cascade&#8208;targeting drug delivery system (DDS) that can sequentially target macrophages and intracellular bacteria, exhibiting on&#8208;site drug delivery, is reported. The DDS is fabricated by encapsulating rifampicin (Rif) into mannose&#8208;decorated poly(&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;phenylalanine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;aminoalanine) nanoparticles, denoted as Rif@FAM NPs. The mannose units on Rif@FAM NPs guide the initial macrophage&#8208;specific uptake and intracellular accumulation. After the uptake, the detachment of mannose in acidic phagolysosome via Schiff base cleavage exposes the d&#8208;aminoalanine moieties, which subsequently steer the NPs to escape from lysosomes and target intracellular bacteria through peptidoglycan&#8208;specific binding, as evidenced by the in situ/ex situ co&#8208;localization using confocal, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Through the on&#8208;site Rif delivery, Rif@FAM NPs show superior in vitro and in vivo elimination efficiency than the control groups of free Rif or the DDSs lacking the macrophages&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;targeting moieties. Furthermore, Rif@FAM NPs remodel the innate immune response of the infected macrophages by upregulating M1/M2 polarization, resulting in a reinforced antibacterial capacity. Therefore, this biocompatible DDS enabling macrophages and bacteria targeting in a cascade manner provides a new outlook for the therapy of intracellular pathogen infection.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Ultrathin Highly Crystalline Pt&#8211;Ni Nanostructure on a Metal Carbide Template for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;carbide&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth strategy is demonstrated as an effective method for fabricating highly active Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Owing to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;favored facets and high active surface area, the derived ultrathin highly crystalline Pt3Ni nanocages display excellent ORR activity. This novel method offers a promising and economical routine for design excellent noble metal electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Structure engineering strategies such as core&#8211;shell and hollow nanostructures are effective pathways to improve the utilization of noble metals for catalysis. However, nowadays materials design based on these strategies still largely rely on precious metal templates. Herein, the epitaxial growth of highly crystalline Pt3Ni overlayer on earth&#8208;abundant nickel carbide is reported, forming Ni3C@Pt3Ni core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with a well&#8208;defined interface through a new lattice&#8208;match&#8208;directed synthetic strategy. Derived from such core&#8211;shell nanostructures, ultrathin highly crystalline Pt3Ni nanocages have an advantageous configuration of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;favored facets and inherently high active surface area for the ORR, bringing high mass activity and specific activity as much as 4.71&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 and 5.14&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which are 26 and 20 times to that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. This novel epitaxial growth of platinum opens up new avenues to rationally design highly active and economical electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Road for 2D Semiconductors in the Silicon Age</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon technologies, including 2D logic and memory devices, enabling the mitigation of challenges related to silicon integrated circuits (ICs) and even the creation of technologies beyond silicon, is highlighted. The progress of 2D IC applications and the prospects for realizing wafer&#8208;scale heterogeneous integration compatible with silicon ICs are also summarized.








Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's law approaches physical limits, high&#8208;performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultrathin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon&#8208;compatible processes of 2D materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. Here, the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture, is presented, and the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs are discussed. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one perception, memory, and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer&#8208;scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon are presented.

         <title>Bioinspired Electron Polarization of Nanozyme with Human Self&#8208;Generated Electric Field for Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
ROS production efficiencies of the nanocatalysts is highly desired for cancer therapy, but currently the ROS generation efficiency is still far from defecting the tumors. Therefore, improving their ROS generation ability is highly desirable for cancer therapy. Herein, inspired by the electrostatic preorganization effect during the catalysis of natural protein enzymes, we developed a human self&#8208;driven catalysis&#8208;promoting system, TENG&#8208;CatSystem, to improve catalytic cancer therapy. TENG&#8208;CatSystem is mainly composed of three main elements: a human self&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as the electric field stimulator to provide electric pulses with high biosafety, a nanozyme comprising a one&#8208;dimensional ferriporphyrin covalent organic framework coated on a carbon nanotube (COF&#8208;CNT) to generate ROS, and a COF&#8208;CNT&#8208;embedded conductive hydrogel that can be injected into the tumor tissues to increase local accumulation of COF&#8208;CNT and decrease the electrical impedances of tissues. Under the human self&#8208;generated electric field provided by the wearable TENG, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of COF&#8208;CNT was four&#8208;fold higher than that without an electric field. Highly malignant 4T1 breast carcinoma in mice was significantly suppressed using TENG&#8208;CatSystem. The human self&#8208;driven TENG&#8208;CatSystem not only demonstrates high catalytic ROS generation efficiency for improved cancer therapy, but also offers a new therapeutic mode of self&#8208;driven at&#8208;home therapy.

         <title>Catalytic Kinetics Regulation for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrogen Oxidation by Ru Nanoclusters&#8208;Coupled Mn3O4 Catalysts Decorated with Atomically Dispersed Ru Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemical N2 oxidation reaction (NOR), using water and N2 in the atmosphere, represents a sustainable approach for nitric production to replace the conventional industrial synthesis with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. While, owing to chemical inertness of N2 and sluggish kinetics for 10&#8208;electron transfer, emerging electrocatalysts remain largely underexplored. Herein, Ru nanoclusters&#8208;coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms (Ru&#8208;Mn3O4) were designed and explored as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with an excellent Faraday efficiency (28.87%) and a remarkable NO3&#8722; yield (35.34&#160;&#956;g h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1cat.), respectively. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the outstanding activity was ascribed to the co&#8208;existence of Ru cluster and single&#8208;atom&#8208;Ru. The synergistic effect between Ru cluster and Mn3O4 could effectively activate chemically inert N2, lower the kinetic barrier for the vital breakage of N&#2301;N. The intensive *OH supply and enhanced conductivity were used to regular the catalytic kinetics for optimized performance. This work provides fire&#8208;new ideas for the rational design of electrocatalysts in complicated electrocatalytic reactions with multiple dynamics&#8208;different steps.

         <title>Multivariate Analysis Identifying [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ Design and Device Architecture Enables First&#8208;Class Blue and White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate analysis sets relevant statistical correlation between the X&#8208;ray structure and electronic features of [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ and their photo&#8208; and electroluminescent features in thin&#8208;films to elucidate the best complex design for the first blue and white light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells, outperforming the prior art.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) comprising only [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ have not been reported yet, as all the attempts toward blue&#8208;emitting complexes failed. Multivariate analysis, based on prior&#8208;art [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based thin&#8208;film lighting (&gt;90&#160;papers) and refined with computational calculations, identifies the best blue&#8208;emitting [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ design for LECs, that is, N^N: 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine and P^P: 4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene, to achieve predicted thin&#8208;film emission at 490&#160;nm and device performance of 3.8&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@170&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Validation comes from synthesis, X&#8208;ray structure, thin&#8208;film spectroscopic/microscopy/electrochemical characterization, and device optimization, realizing the first [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue&#8208;LEC with 3.6&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@180&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This represents a record performance compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tricoordinate Cu(I)&#8208;complexes blue&#8208;LECs (0.17&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@20&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2). Versatility is confirmed with the synthesis of the analogous complex with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyrazine (N^N), showing a close prediction/experiment match: &#955;&#160;=&#160;590/580&#160;nm; efficiency&#160;=&#160;0.55/0.60&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@30&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Finally, experimental design is applied to fabricate the best white multicomponent host:guest LEC, reducing the number of trial&#8208;error attempts toward the first white all&#8208;[Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;LECs with 0.6&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@30&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This corresponds to approximately ten&#8208;fold enhancement compared to previous LECs (&lt;0.05&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@&lt;12&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2). Hence, this work sets in the first multivariate approach to design emitters/active layers, accomplishing first&#8208;class [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue/white LECs that were&#160;previously elusive.

         <title>Energy&#8208;saving Hydrogen Production by Seawater Electrolysis Coupling Sulfion Degradation</title>

Abstract
Electrolysis of costless and infinite seawater is a promising way towards grid&#8208;scale hydrogen production without causing freshwater stress. Practical potential of this technology, however, is hindered by low energy efficiency and anode corrosion by detrimental chlorine chemistry in seawater in addition to unaffordable electricity expanse. Herein, we report energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production by chlorine&#8208;free seawater splitting coupling sulfion oxidation. It yields hydrogen at a low cell voltage of 0.97&#160;V, cutting the electricity consumption to 2.32&#160;kWh per m3 H2 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. Compared to alkaline water electrolysis, the energy expense is primarily saved by 60% with 50% lower energy equivalent input. Benefited from ultralow cell voltage, the hazardous chlorine chemistry is fully avoided without anode corrosion regardless Cl&#8211; crossover. Meanwhile, it also allows fast degradation of S2&#8211; pollutant from water body to value&#8208;added sulfur with 80% efficiency for further reducing hydrogen cost and protection of the ecosystem. Connecting such a hybrid seawater electrolyzer to the commercial solar cell can harvest the hydrogen from seawater with better sustainability. This work may offer new opportunities for low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from unlimited ocean resources and environmental protection.

         <title>Biodegradable Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Gated Organosilica for Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Unlocked Glutathione&#8208;Depletion&#8208;Enhanced Synergistic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;unlocked nanoformula is judiciously designed by the smart use of a biodegradable metal&#8211;organic framework to gate the pores of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles. This method can not only realize acidic&#8208;TME&#8208;responsive cisplatin release, but also deplete glutathione and simultaneously catalyze the generation of &#8226;OH via Cu2+ for highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific synergistic chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy against cancer with negligible biosafety concerns.








Abstract
The clinical employment of cisplatin (cis&#8208;diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP)) is largely constrained due to the non&#8208;specific delivery and resultant serious systemic toxicity. Small&#8208;sized biocompatible and biodegradable hollow mesoporous organosilica (HMOS) nanoparticles show superior advantages for targeted CDDP delivery but suffer from premature CDDP leakage. Herein, the smart use of a bimetallic Zn2+/Cu2+ co&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is made to block the pores of HMOS for preventing potential leakage of CDDP and remarkably increasing the loading capacity of HMOS. Once reaching the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), the outer MOF can decompose quickly to release CDDP for chemotherapy against cancer. Besides, the concomitant release of dopant Cu2+ can deplete the intracellular glutathione (GSH) for increased toxicity of CDDP as well as catalyzing the decomposition of intratumoral H2O2 into highly toxic &#8226;OH for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Moreover, the substantially reduced GSH can also protect the yielded &#8226;OH from scavenging and thus greatly improve the &#8226;OH&#8208;based CDT effect. In addition to providing a hybrid HMOS@MOF nanocarrier, this study is also expected to establish a new form of TME&#8208;unlocked nanoformula for highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific GSH&#8208;depletion&#8208;enhanced synergistic chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>A Ferrotoroidic Candidate with Well&#8208;Separated Spin Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrotoroidic order is one of the four primary ferroic order forms. Ba6Cr2S10 is reported to be a rare ferrotoroidic candidate with well&#8208;separated 1D spin chain, where the spins are dimerized and antiferromagnetic&#8208;like coupled and the toroidal moment is composed of only two antiparallel spins.








Abstract
The search of novel quasi&#8208;1D materials is one of the important aspects in the field of material science. Toroidal moment, the order parameter of ferrotoroidic order, can be generated by a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail configuration of magnetic moment. It has been theoretically proposed that 1D dimerized and antiferromagnetic (AFM)&#8208;like spin chain hosts ferrotoroidicity and has the toroidal moment composed of only two antiparallel spins. Here, the authors report a ferrotoroidic candidate of Ba6Cr2S10 with such a theoretical model of spin chain. The structure consists of unique dimerized face&#8208;sharing CrS6 octahedral chains along the c axis. An AFM&#8208;like ordering at &#8776;10 K breaks both space&#8208; and time&#8208;reversal symmetries and the magnetic point group of mm&#8242;2&#8242;allows three ferroic orders in Ba6Cr2S10: (anti)ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferrotoroidic orders. Their investigation reveals that Ba6Cr2S10 is a rare ferrotoroid ic candidate with quasi 1D spin chain, which can be considered as a starting point for the further exploration of the physics and applications of ferrotoroidicity.

         <title>Cellular Nanosponges for Biological Neutralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely cellular nanosponges, as host cell decoys for biological neutralization applications is reviewed, including their use to neutralize bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. For each area, the design of different cellular nanosponges and their corresponding neutralization functions are discussed.








Abstract
Biological neutralization represents a general strategy that deploys therapeutic agents to bind with harmful molecules or infectious pathogens, block their bioactivity, and thus prevent them from causing the diseases. Here, a comprehensive review of using cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely &#8220;cellular nanosponges,&#8221; as host decoys for a wide range of biological neutralization applications is provided. Compared to traditional neutralization strategies, the cellular nanosponges stand out by mimicking susceptible host cells rather than accommodating the structures of the causative agents for the design of therapeutics. As all pathological agents must interact with host cells for bioactivity, nanosponges bypass the diversity of these agents and create function&#8208;driven and broad&#8208;spectrum neutralization solutions. The review focuses on the recent progress of using this new nanomedicine platform for neutralization against five primary pathological agents, including bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. Existing studies have established cellular nanosponges as versatile tools for biological neutralization. A thorough review of the cellular nanosponge technology is expected to inspire more refined cellular nanosponge designs and unique neutralization applications to address unsolved medical problems.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Robust 120&#160;keV Hard X&#8208;Ray Imaging Detector based on Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CsPbBr2.9I0.1 (I0.1) detector shows the no&#8208;drift dark current and a record sensitivity of 6.3 &#215; 104&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#160;keV high&#8208;energy hard X&#8208;rays under a 5000&#160;V cm&#8722;1 electric field due to the suppressed ion migration. Moreover, clear X&#8208;ray imaging of the &#8220;pork rib&#8221; is realized using the I0.1 planar array detector under 120&#160;keV X&#8208;ray irradiation.








Abstract
The relatively low resistivity and severe ion migration in CsPbBr3 significantly degrade the performance of X&#8208;ray detectors due to their high detection limit and current drift. The electrical properties and X&#8208;ray detection performances of CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals are investigated by doping the iodine atoms into the melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3. The resistivity of CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals increases from 3.6 &#215; 109 (CsPbBr3) to 2.2 &#215; 1011 (CsPbBr2I) &#937; cm, restraining the leak current and decreasing the detection limit of the detector. Additionally, CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals exhibit stable dark currents, arising from their high ion migration activation energy. A record sensitivity of 6.3 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (CsPbBr2.9I0.1) and a low detection limit of 54 nGy s&#8722;1 (CsPbBr2I) are achieved by CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals for the 120 keV hard X&#8208;ray detection under a 5000 V cm&#8722;1 electrical field. The CsPbBr2.9I0.1 detector shows a stable current response with a dark current density of 0.58 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 for 30 days and clear imaging for 120 keV Xrays at ambient conditions. The effective iodine atom doping strategy makes the CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals promising for reproducible high&#8208;energy hard X&#8208;ray imaging systems.

         <title>A Solution&#8208;Processed Inorganic Emitter with High Spectral Selectivity for Efficient Subambient Radiative Cooling in Hot Humid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different emissive behaviors between a bulk film and particles in reststrahlen band are utilized and an emitter with excellent spectrum selectivity is achieved. This emitter successfully realizes good subambient cooling in hot and humid conditions, which is always a challenge for radiative cooling. The all&#8208;inorganic components and solution&#8208;based fabrication process render it durable and scalable simultaneously.








Abstract
Daytime radiative cooling provides an eco&#8208;friendly solution to space cooling with zero energy consumption. Despite significant advances, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative coolers show broadband infrared emission with low spectral selectivity, which limits their cooling temperatures, especially in hot humid regions. Here, an all&#8208;inorganic narrowband emitter comprising a solution&#8208;derived SiOxNy layer sandwiched between a reflective substrate and a self&#8208;assembly monolayer of SiO2 microspheres is reported. It shows a high and diffusive solar reflectance (96.4%) and strong infrared&#8208;selective emittance (94.6%) with superior spectral selectivity (1.46). Remarkable subambient cooling of up to 5&#160;&#176;C in autumn and 2.5&#160;&#176;C in summer are achieved under high humidity without any solar shading or convection cover at noontime in a subtropical coastal city, Hong Kong. Owing to the all&#8208;inorganic hydrophobic structure, the emitter shows outstanding resistance to ultraviolet and water in long&#8208;term durability tests. The scalable&#8208;solution&#8208;based fabrication renders this stable high&#8208;performance emitter promising for large&#8208;scale deployment in various climates.

         <title>Efficiency of Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. An important contribution to the EQE of a PLED orignates from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in a PPV&#8208;based PLED, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.








Abstract
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. The EQE of an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is governed by a number of parameters, such as the electrical efficiency, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the optical outcoupling efficiency and the spin statistics for singlet exciton generation. In the last decade, the electrical efficiency has been determined from a numerical PLED device model. More recently, an optical model to simulate the fraction of photons outcoupled to air for PLEDs with a broad recombination zone has been developed. Together with the directly measured PLQY, the EQE of a PLED can then be estimated. However, it has been observed that the measured EQEs of fluorescent PLEDs, including the model system super&#8208;yellow poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (SY&#8208;PPV) often exceed the expected values. To solve this discrepancy, it is demonstrate that the electrical PLED model has to be expanded by the inclusion of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA), which is shown to be responsible for a substantial EQE enhancement. Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in SY&#8208;PPV PLEDs, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.

         <title>Observation of 3D Biexcitons in Pristine&#8208;Quality CH3NH3PbBr3 Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the existence of biexcitons in high&#8208;quality 3D perovskite single crystals is demonstrated based on the series of clear&#8208;cut spectroscopic evidences: i) exciton&#8211;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two&#8208;photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann&#8208;type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs) are fascinating materials whose optoelectronic properties are arguably excitonic. In the HP family, biexcitons are known to exist only in low dimensions where exciton&#8211;exciton binding is strongly enhanced by quantum and dielectric confinements. In this paper, however, it is shown that they indeed do exist in 3D bulk CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) single crystals if the pristine crystal quality is ensured for subtle binding of two excitons. The existence of biexcitons is clearly evidenced below 30 K with a binding energy of &#8776;3.9 &#177; 0.3 meV according to i) exciton&#8211;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two&#8208;photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann&#8208;type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence. Because of the polariton effect, the two&#8208;photon resonance occurs at the excited biexciton state from which longitudinal&#8208;transverse splitting is calculated to be 3.7 meV.

     alt="Observation of 3D Biexcitons in Pristine-Quality CH3NH3PbBr3 Single Crystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the existence of biexcitons in high-quality 3D perovskite single crystals is demonstrated based on the series of clear-cut spectroscopic evidences: i) exciton&#8211;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two-photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann-type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halide perovskites (HPs) are fascinating materials whose optoelectronic properties are arguably excitonic. In the HP family, biexcitons are known to exist only in low dimensions where exciton&#8211;exciton binding is strongly enhanced by quantum and dielectric confinements. In this paper, however, it is shown that they indeed do exist in 3D bulk CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (MAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) single crystals if the pristine crystal quality is ensured for subtle binding of two excitons. The existence of biexcitons is clearly evidenced below 30 K with a binding energy of &#8776;3.9 &#177; 0.3 meV according to i) exciton&#8211;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two-photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann-type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence. Because of the polariton effect, the two-photon resonance occurs at the excited biexciton state from which longitudinal-transverse splitting is calculated to be 3.7 meV. The discovery of the 3D biexcitons underscores the very quality of HP crystals for generating various many-body excitonic phases in MAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and its analogues toward the improved understanding of their fundamental properties and highly efficient optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhaled mRNA nanoformulation with biogenic ribosomal protein reverses established pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model</title>

Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a lethal respiratory disease with few treatment options, occurs due to repetitive microinjuries to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and progresses with an overwhelming deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), ultimately resulting in fibrotic scars and destroyed alveolar architecture. Here, an inhaled ribosomal protein&#8208;based mRNA nanoformulation is reported for clearing the intrapulmonary ECM and re&#8208;epithelializing the disrupted alveolar epithelium, thereby reversing established fibrotic foci in IPF. The nanoformulation is sequentially assembled by a ribosomal protein&#8208;condensed mRNA core, a bifunctional peptide&#8208;modified corona and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) with a PEGylated shielding shell. When inhaled via a nebulizer, the nanoformulations carried by microdrops are deposited in alveoli, and penetrate into fibrotic foci, where the outer KGFs are detached after matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) triggering. The RGD motif&#8208;grafted cores then expose and specifically target the integrin&#8208;elevated cells for the intracellular delivery of mRNA. Notably, repeated inhalation of the nanoformulations accelerates the clearance of locoregional collagen by boosting the intralesional expression of MMP13 and alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization mediated by KGFs, which synergistically ameliorates the lung function of a bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model. Therefore, our work provides an alternative mRNA&#8208;inhaled delivery strategy that shows great potential for the treatment of IPF.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metaphosphate&#8208;like Terminals Enable High&#8208;Capacity MXene Anodes for Ultrafast Na&#8208;ion Storage</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, so&#8208;called MXenes, have been noted as ideal fast&#8208;charging cation&#8208;intercalation electrode materials, which nevertheless suffer from limited specific capacities. Herein, we report that constructing redox&#8208;active phosphorus&#8208;oxygen terminals can be an attractive strategy for Nb4C3 MXenes to remarkably boost their specific capacities for ultrafast Na+ storage. As revealed, redox&#8208;active terminals with a stoichiometric formula of PO2&#8208; display a metaphosphate&#8208;like configuration with each P atom sustaining three P&#8208;O bonds and one P = O dangling bond. Compared with conventional O&#8208;terminals, metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals empower Nb4C3 (denoted PO2&#8208;Nb4C3) with considerably enriched carrier density (4&#8208;fold), improved conductivity (12.3&#8208;fold at 300 K), additional redox&#8208;active sites, boosted Nb redox depth, non&#8208;declined Na+ diffusion capability, and buffered internal stress during Na+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Consequently, compared with O&#8208;terminated Nb4C3, PO2&#8208;Nb4C3 exhibits a doubled Na+&#8208;storage capacity (221.0 mAh g&#8211;1), well&#8208;retained fast&#8208;charging capability (4.9&#160;min at 80% capacity retention), significantly promoted cycle life (non&#8208;degraded capacity over 2000 cycles), and justified feasibility for assembling energy&#8208;power balanced Na&#8208;ion capacitors. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities for developing simultaneously high&#8208;capacity and fast&#8208;charging electrodes, alleviating the energy&#8208;power tradeoff typical for energy storage devices.

Abstract
Driver's access to information about navigation and vehicle data through in&#8208;car displays and personal devices distract the driver from safe vehicle management. The discrepancy between road safety and infotainment must be addressed to develop safely&#8208;operated modern vehicles. Head&#8208;up Displays (HUDs) aim to introduce a seamless uptake of visual information for the driver while securely operating a vehicle. HUDs projected on the windshield provide the driver with visual navigation and vehicle data within the comfort of the driver's personal eye box through a customizable extended display space. Windshield HUDs does not require the driver to shift the gaze away from the road to attain road information. This article presents a review of technological advances and future perspectives in holographic HUDs by analyzing the optoelectronics devices and the user experience of the driver. The review elucidates holographic displays and full augmented reality (AR) in 3D with depth perception when projecting the visual information on the road within the driver's gaze. Design factors, functionality and the integration of personalized machine learning (ML) technologies into holographic HUDs are discussed. Application examples of the display technologies regarding road safety and security are presented. An outlook is provided to reflect on display trends and autonomous driving.

         <title>Constructing Structurally Ordered High&#8208;entropy Alloy Nanoparticles on Nitrogen&#8208;rich Mesoporous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;performance Oxygen Reduction</title>

Abstract
Recent efforts have observed nanoscaled chemical short&#8208;range order in bulk high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Simultaneously inspired with the nanostructuring technology, the HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with complete chemical order might be achieved. Herein, we construct structurally ordered HEA NPs on a novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nitrogen rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA&#8208;mNC) by combining a ligand assisted interfacial assembly with NH3 annealing. Characterization results show that the resultant materials possess an ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure with large mesopores (&#8764;10&#160;nm), where structurally ordered HEA NPs with a L12 phase are homogenously dispersed. The atom&#8208;resolved chemical analyses explicitly determine the location of each atomic site. When being evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction, the OHEA&#8208;mNC NPs affords a greatly enhanced catalytic performance, including a large half&#8208;wave potential (0.90&#160;eV) and a high durability (0.01&#160;V decay after 10,000 cycles) compared with the disordered HEA and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The excellent performance is attributed to the enhanced mass transfer rate, improved electron conductivity, and presence of stable chemically ordered HEA phase, as revealed by both the experimental results and theoretical calculation. This study suggests a highly feasible process to achieve structurally ordered HEA NPs with advanced mesoporous function in electrochemical field.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Synthesis of Flash Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash Joule heating is a process that synthesizes nanomaterials from low&#8208;value materials or waste. However, the parameters that drive this synthesis remain ambiguous. This work applies machine learning (ML) tools to study the crystallization of amorphous carbon into flash graphene by flash Joule heating. ML models show the ability to predict flash graphene crystallinity with an r2 score of 0.8051.








Abstract
Advances in nanoscience have enabled the synthesis of nanomaterials, such as graphene, from low&#8208;value or waste materials through flash Joule heating. Though this capability is promising, the complex and entangled variables that govern nanocrystal formation in the Joule heating process remain poorly understood. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are constructed to explore the factors that drive the transformation of amorphous carbon into graphene nanocrystals during flash Joule heating. An XGBoost regression model of crystallinity achieves an r2 score of 0.8051 &#177; 0.054. Feature importance assays and decision trees extracted from these models reveal key considerations in the selection of starting materials and the role of stochastic current fluctuations in flash Joule heating synthesis. Furthermore, partial dependence analyses demonstrate the importance of charge and current density as predictors of crystallinity, implying a progression from reaction&#8208;limited to diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics as flash Joule heating parameters change. Finally, a practical application of the ML models is shown by using Bayesian meta&#8208;learning algorithms to automatically improve bulk crystallinity over many Joule heating reactions. These results illustrate the power of ML as a tool to analyze complex nanomanufacturing processes and enable the synthesis of 2D crystals with desirable properties by flash Joule heating.

&lt;p&gt;Flash Joule heating is a process that synthesizes nanomaterials from low-value materials or waste. However, the parameters that drive this synthesis remain ambiguous. This work applies machine learning (ML) tools to study the crystallization of amorphous carbon into flash graphene by flash Joule heating. ML models show the ability to predict flash graphene crystallinity with an &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; score of 0.8051.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Electrical Conductivity in Filler&#8208;Free Polymeric Hydrogels Toward Thermoelectrics and Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEDOT:PSS hydrogels exhibit high conductivities up to &#8776;305 S cm&#8722;1, which is &#8776;8 times higher than the record of polymeric hydrogels without conductive fillers. The high electrical conductivity results in enhanced areal thermoelectric output power for hydrogel&#8208;based thermoelectric devices, and high specific electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency (an order in magnitude higher than that of reported of state&#8208;of&#8208;the art conductive hydrogels).








Abstract
Conducting hydrogels have attracted much attention for the emerging field of hydrogel bioelectronics, especially poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) based hydrogels, because of their great biocompatibility and stability. However, the electrical conductivities of hydrogels are often lower than 1 S cm&#8722;1 which are not suitable for digital circuits or applications in bioelectronics. Introducing conductive inorganic fillers into the hydrogels can improve their electrical conductivities. However, it may lead to compromises in compliance, biocompatibility, deformability, biodegradability, etc. Herein, a series of highly conductive ionic liquid (IL) doped PEDOT:PSS hydrogels without any conductive fillers is reported. These hydrogels exhibit high conductivities up to &#8776;305 S cm&#8722;1, which is &#8776;8 times higher than the record of polymeric hydrogels without conductive fillers in literature. The high electrical conductivity results in enhanced areal thermoelectric output power for hydrogel&#8208;based thermoelectric devices, and high specific electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency which is about an order in magnitude higher than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conductive hydrogels in literature. Furthermore, these stretchable (strain &gt;30%)&#160;hydrogels exhibit fast self&#8208;healing, and shape/size&#8208;tunable properties, which are desirable for hydrogel bioelectronics and wearable organic devices. The results indicate that these highly conductive hydrogels are promising in applications such as sensing, thermoelectrics, EMI shielding, etc.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Engineered Nanodecoys for the Multi&#8208;Target Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;engineered nanodecoys (NDs) based on programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208;expressing macrophage membrane (PRM) are developed for the multi&#8208;target management of autoimmune diseases. PRM NDs scavenge multiple pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and meanwhile reconstruct the programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory axis to inhibit CD4+ T cell activation and restore immune tolerance, which cooperatively reverses the immune&#8208;activation and interrupt the self&#8208;amplified inflammatory cascades.








Abstract
Overactivated T cells and overproduced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines form a self&#8208;amplified signaling loop to continuously exacerbate the dysregulated inflammatory response and propel the progression of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). Herein, immuno&#8208;engineered nanodecoys (NDs) based on poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles coated with programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208;expressing macrophage membrane (PRM) are developed to mediate multi&#8208;target interruption of the self&#8208;promoted inflammatory cascade in AIDs. The PRM collected from IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;treated RAW 264.7 cells possesses elevated surface levels of adhesion molecule receptors and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine receptors, and, thus, systemically administered PRM NDs afford higher accumulation level in inflamed tissues and stronger scavenging efficiency toward multiple pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. More importantly, IFN&#8208;&#947; treatment induces remarkable PD&#8208;L1 expression on PRM, thereby allowing PRM NDs to bind membrane&#8208;bound programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) on CD4+ T cell surfaces or neutralize free soluble PD&#8208;1, which reconstructs the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory axis to suppress CD4+ T cell activation and restore immune tolerance. As such, PRM NDs provoke potent and cooperative anti&#8208;inflammatory and immune&#8208;suppressive efficacies to alleviate autoimmune damages in Zymosan A&#8208;induced arthritis mice and dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis mice. This study provides an enlightened example for the immuno&#8208;engineering of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;based NDs, rendering promising implications into the treatment of AIDs via multi&#8208;target immune&#8208;modulation.

         <title>Spiral Growth of Adlayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of adlayer graphene spirals and onions with novel spiral arms by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is confirmed. These CVD&#8208;prepared graphene spirals and onions exhibit more than one arm (with two, three, four, and five arms) together with clockwise and anticlockwise direction of rotation of each arm, which can be reproduced by using the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.








Abstract
The morphology of as&#8208;grown graphene in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments is sensitive to the reaction environment. Understanding the mechanism of formation of different graphene morphologies is essential to achieve controlled graphene CVD growth. Here the growth and formation mechanism of adlayer graphene spirals are reported. An adlayer graphene spiral is formed by fast propagation of the tips of spiral arms along the edge of the first graphene layer. The driving force to form spirals is the limited availability of carbon diffusing from the Cu surface through the edge of the first graphene layer. In addition, it is found that graphene onions are formed by overlapping graphene spirals with clockwise and anticlockwise arms. Based on these features, a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method is demonstrated using which all the observed graphene spiral structures are successfully reproduced at the atomic level. This study thus unravels the hither&#8208;to unresolved mechanism of graphene onion growth and paves the way to the controllable growth of few&#8208;layer graphene by increasing the carbon supply at the edge of the first layer graphene.

Patterned surfaces can enhance the sensitivity of laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry by segregating and concentrating analytes, but their fabrication can be challenging. A simple method to fabricate substrates patterned with micrometer&#8208;scale wells that yield more accurate and sensitive mass spectrometry measurements compared to a flat surface or cylindrical wells is presented. The wells can also concentrate and localize cells and beads for cell&#8208;based assays.

         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), namely phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts spin selectivity to various electron processes, has long defied a comprehensive theoretical explanation. Here, the status of CISS in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions is reviewed. For each, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding is discussed and remaining challenges are identified.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates: A Promising Perspective on a Dual&#8208;Gate Antiambipolar Transistor</title>

Abstract
Electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits are promising candidates for realizing new computation architectures, such as artificial intelligence and neuromorphic devices. In this study, we attained multiple logic gate operations based on a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG&#8208;OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;&#8208;shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom&#8208;gate, top&#8208;gate, and drain voltages. This distinctive feature enables multiple logic gate operations with &#8220;only a single DG&#8208;OAAT,&#8221; which are not obtainable in conventional transistors. Five logic gate operations, which correspond to AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR, are demonstrated by adjusting the bottom&#8208;gate and top&#8208;gate voltages. Moreover, varying the drain voltage makes it possible to reversibly switch two logic gates, e.g., NAND/NOR and OR/XOR. In addition, the DG&#8208;OAATs show a high degree of stability and reliability. The logic gate operations were observed even months later. The hysteresis in the transfer curves was also negligible. Thus, our device concept is promising for realizing multifunctional logic circuits with a simple transistor configuration. Hence, these findings are expected to surpass the current limitations in complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor devices.

&lt;p&gt;Electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits are promising candidates for realizing new computation architectures, such as artificial intelligence and neuromorphic devices. In this study, we attained multiple logic gate operations based on a dual-gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG-OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;-shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom-gate, top-gate, and drain voltages. This distinctive feature enables multiple logic gate operations with &#8220;only a single DG-OAAT,&#8221; which are not obtainable in conventional transistors.

         <title>Nonlocality&#8208;Enabled Pulse Management in Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlocal epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero metamaterials are demonstrated to shape ultrashort optical pulses in sub&#8208;wavelength thick devices. The metamaterial operates over a wide bandwidth of tens of THz, and the switching between sub to superluminal and further to &#8216;backward&#8217; pulse propagation is realized by controlling the angle of illumination.








Abstract
Ultrashort optical pulses are integral to probing various physical, chemical, and biological phenomena and feature in a whole host of applications, not least in data communications. Super&#8208; and subluminal pulse propagation and dispersion management (DM) are two of the greatest challenges in producing or counteracting modifications of ultrashort optical pulses when precise control over pulse characteristics is required. Progress in modern photonics toward integrated solutions and applications has intensified this need for greater control of ultrafast pulses in nanoscale dimensions. Metamaterials, with their unique ability to provide designed optical properties, offer a new avenue for temporal pulse engineering. Here an epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero metamaterial is employed, exhibiting strong nonlocal (spatial dispersion) effects, to temporally shape optical pulses. The authors experimentally demonstrate, over a wide bandwidth of tens of THz, the ability to switch from sub to superluminal and further to &#8220;backward&#8221; pulse propagation (&#177;c/20) in the same metamaterial device by simply controlling the angle of illumination. Both the amplitude and phase of a 10&#160;ps pulse can be controlled through DM in this subwavelength device. Shaping ultrashort optical pulses with metamaterials promises to be advantageous in laser physics, optical communications, imaging, and spectroscopy applications using both integrated and free&#8208;standing devices.

         <title>Quadri&#8208;Dimensional Manipulable Laser with Intrinsic Chiral Photoswitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dynamic and multi&#8208;dimensional manipulation of laser emission with light allows for optical coding, computing, and imaging photonic chips. However, the coupling balance between photonic resonance and transmission is a formidable challenge due to the uncontrollable chiral microcavity with photo&#8208;reversibility, which is limited to the multi&#8208;freedom of laser with sustainable and repeatable output beams. Herein, we develop a helical superstructure system with a unique intrinsic chiral photoswitch for resolving the always pendent problems on organized defects in microcavity. The unique intrinsic chirality based on photoswitchable system allows a laser emission with sharp and narrow band&#8208;width with both remarkable thermodynamic stability and robust fatigue&#8208;resistance. Quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser, featuring wavelength&#8208;tunability, wavefront&#8208;shaping, spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is successfully established with assistance of the photoresponsive intrinsic chiral superstructure with photoreversibility. This technology marks an important milestone, and sketches a future framework for the realms of nanophotonic information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.

         <title>Mechanically Guided Hierarchical Assembly of 3D Mesostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of multiple layers of independently prestretched elastomeric substrates in mechanically guided 3D assembly provides access to complex hierarchical 3D architectures that were&#160;previously inaccessible, including vertically aligned helices and fully closed 3D cages. These hierarchical assembly concepts create possibilities for a broad range of fields from microrobotics and reconfigurable metamaterials to bio&#8208;integrated electronics.








Abstract
3D, hierarchical micro/nanostructures formed with advanced functional materials are of growing interest due to their broad potential utility in electronics, robotics, battery technology, and biomedical engineering. Among various strategies in 3D micro/nanofabrication, a set of methods based on compressive buckling offers wide&#8208;ranging material compatibility, fabrication scalability, and precise process control. Previously reports on this type of approach rely on a single, planar prestretched elastomeric platform to transform thin&#8208;film precursors with 2D layouts into 3D architectures. The simple planar configuration of bonding sites between these precursors and their assembly substrates prevents the realization of certain types of complex 3D geometries. In this paper, a set of hierarchical assembly concepts is reported that leverage multiple layers of prestretched elastomeric substrates to induce not only compressive buckling of 2D precursors bonded to them but also of themselves, thereby creating 3D mesostructures mounted at multiple levels of 3D frameworks with complex, elaborate configurations. Control over strains used in these processes provides reversible access to multiple different 3D layouts in a given structure. Examples to demonstrate these ideas through both experimental and computational results span vertically aligned helices to closed 3D cages, selected for their relevance to 3D conformal bio&#8208;interfaces and multifunctional microsystems.

         <title>Fast Self&#8208;Assembly of Scalable Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystals and Hybrid Films via Electrophoresis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and scalable electrophoretic&#8208;deposition&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly technique of photonic cellulose nanocrystal films, that can circumvent the long process evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA), is developed. Iridescent films with tunable color can be achieved in a few minutes by simple adjustment of the suspension properties.

Abstract
Nano&#8208;enabled, bio&#8208;based, functional materials are key for the transition to a sustainable society as they can be used, owing to both their performance and nontoxicity, to gradually replace existing nonrenewable engineering materials. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), produced by acid hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass, have been shown to possess distinct self&#8208;assembly, optical, and electromechanical properties, and are anticipated to play an important role in the fabrication of photonic, optoelectronic, and functional hybrid materials. To facilitate CNCs&#8217; technological viability, a method suitable for industrial exploitation is developed to produce photonic films possessing long&#8208;range chirality on conductive, rigid, or flexible, substrates within a few minutes. The approach is based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD)&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of CNCs, where photonic films of any size can be produced by controlling CNC surface properties and EPD parameters. CNC film coloration can be determined by the CNC aqueous suspension characteristics, while their reflected intensity can be tuned by changing the duration and number of electrodeposition cycles. EPD&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of CNCs is compatible with in situ reduction of gold precursors without the need to use additional reducing agents (some of which are considered toxic), thereby allowing the preparation of hybrid photonic films with tunable plasmonic response in a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Synthesis of Ultrathin, Flexible, and Transparent Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Thin Films via a Microfluidic&#8208;Based Solution Shearing Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic&#8208;assisted solution shearing combined with post&#8208;synthetic rapid crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process is introduced, which enables the formation of high&#8208;quality conductive Ni3(HITP)2 thin&#8208;films with thickness controllability down to 10 nm in a rapid large&#8208;area scalable manner. This process can fabricate flexible and transparent Ni3(HITP)2 thin film for high&#8208;performance wearable gas sensors.








Abstract
Iminosemiquinone&#8208;linker&#8208;based conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted much attention as next&#8208;generation electronic materials due to their high electrical conductivity combined with high porosity. However, the utility of such c&#8208;MOFs in high&#8208;performance devices has been limited to date by the lack of high&#8208;quality MOF thin&#8208;film processing. Herein, a technique known as the microfluidic&#8208;assisted solution shearing combined with post&#8208;synthetic rapid crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process is introduced to generate a high&#8208;quality, flexible, and transparent thin&#8208;film of Ni3(hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) uniformly over a large&#8208;area in a high&#8208;throughput manner with thickness controllability down to tens of nanometers. The MASS&#8208;PRC process utilizes: 1) a micromixer&#8208;embedded blade to simultaneously mix and continuously supply the metal&#8211;ligand solution toward the drying front during solution shearing to generate an amorphous thin&#8208;film, followed by: 2) immersion in amine solution for rapid directional crystal growth. The as&#8208;synthesized c&#8208;MOF film has transparency of up to 88.8% and conductivity as high as 37.1 S cm&#8722;1. The high uniformity in conductivity is confirmed over a 3500 mm2 area with an arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) of 4.78&#160;nm. The flexible thin&#8208;film demonstrates the highest level of transparency for Ni3(HITP)2 and the highest hydrogen sulfide (H2S) sensing performance (2,085% at 5&#160;ppm) among c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based H2S sensors, enabling wearable gas&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Retina&#8208;Inspired Color&#8208;Cognitive Learning via Chromatically Controllable Mixed Quantum Dot Synaptic Transistor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial visual perception system that enables full&#8208;range visible color recognition by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of precisely designed size&#8208;mixed quantum dot photoabsorbers and amorphous In&#8211;Ga&#8211;Zn&#8211;O semiconducting channels is proposed. Moreover, this artificial photonic synapse shows chromatically controllable synaptic plasticity by gate field modulation, inducing multiple selective nonvolatile detection modes.








Abstract
Artificial photonic synapses are emerging as a promising implementation to emulate the human visual cognitive system by consolidating a series of processes for sensing and memorizing visual information into one system. In particular, mimicking retinal functions such as multispectral color perception and controllable nonvolatility is important for realizing artificial visual systems. However, many studies to date have focused on monochromatic&#8208;light&#8208;based photonic synapses, and thus, the emulation of color discrimination capability remains an important challenge for visual intelligence. Here, an artificial multispectral color recognition system by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of ratio&#8208;controllable mixed quantum dot (M&#8208;QD) photoabsorbers and metal&#8208;oxide semiconducting channels is proposed. The biological photoreceptor inspires M&#8208;QD photoabsorbers with a precisely designed red (R), green (G), and blue (B)&#8208;QD ratio, enabling full&#8208;range visible color recognition with high photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion efficiency. In addition, adjustable synaptic plasticity by modulating gate bias allows multiple nonvolatile&#8208;to&#8208;volatile memory conversion, leading to chromatic control in the artificial photonic synapse. To ensure the viability of the developed proof of concept, a 7 &#215; 7 pixelated photonic synapse array capable of performing outstanding color image recognition based on adjustable wavelength&#8208;dependent volatility conversion is demonstrated.

         <title>Prussian blue nanozyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor alleviates neurodegeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current pharmacological interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unsatisfactory in clinical settings. Inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis represents a potential therapeutic target for the alleviation of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis agonists or antagonists may transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the identification of specific compounds that inhibit pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) is revealed as a pyroptosis inhibitor to alleviate the neurodegeneration in a mouse model of PD. PBzyme inhibits the 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1, 2, 3, 6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)/ATP&#8208;induced activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes, attenuates the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential, and rescues dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of PBzyme reduces dopaminergic degeneration, and inhibits neuroinflammation, alleviates the motor deficits in the MPTP&#8208;induced PD mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that PBzyme reduces the activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes and caspase&#8208;1 by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby downregulating GSDMD cleavage as well as inflammatory factor production, and eventually leading to the inhibition of microglia pyroptosis. Overall, our work highlights the neuroprotective effects of PBzyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor and provides valuable mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Antibody&#8208;based cancer therapy, one of the most significant therapeutic strategies, has achieved considerable success and progress over the past decades. Nevertheless, obstacles including limited tumor penetration, short circulation half&#8208;lives, undesired immunogencity, and off&#8208;target side effects remain to be overcome for the antibody&#8208;based cancer treatment. Owing to the rapid development of nanotechnology, antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines that have been extensively explored to overcome these obstacles have already demonstrated to have enhanced anticancer efficacy and clinical translation potential. This review intends to offer an overview of the advancements of antibody&#8208;incorporated nanoparticulate systems in cancer treatment, together with the nontrivial challenges faced by these next&#8208;generation nanomedicines. Diverse strategies of antibody immobilization, formats of antibodies, types of cancer&#8208;associated antigens, and anticancer mechanisms of antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are provided and discussed in this review, with an emphasis on the latest applications. The current limitations and future research directions on antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are also discussed from different perspectives to provide new insights into the construction of anticancer nanomedicines.

Abstract
High&#8208;performance, fully atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation industrial catalysts. However, it remains as a great challenge to avoid the aggregation of isolated atoms into nanoparticles during the preparation and application of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Here, we investigate the evolution of Pd species on different crystal facets of CeO2, and surprisingly discovered vastly different behaviors on the single&#8208;atomic dispersion of surface Pd atoms. The in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;XPS (NAP&#8208;XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that in reducing atmosphere more oxygen vacancies are generated on the (100) facet of CeO2, and Pd atoms can be trapped and thus feature atomic dispersion; by contrast, on CeO2 (111) facet, Pd atoms would readily aggregate into clusters (Pdn). Furthermore, the Pd1/CeO2(100) gave a high selectivity of 90.3% for catalytic N&#8208;alkylation reaction, which is 2.8 times higher than that for Pdn/CeO2(111). These direct evidences demonstrate the crucial role of crystal facet effects in the preparation of metal&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide SACs. This work thus opens an avenue for the rational design and targeted synthesis of ultra&#8208;stable and sinter&#8208;resistant SACs.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>

Abstract
Room temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries, as the promising next&#8208;generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na&#8208;S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfides shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, the hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro&#8208;and&#160;mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and&#160;accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transform of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics.&#160;Thus, the as&#8208;prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Assembling Diverse Skyrmionic Phases in Fe3GeTe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic effective Hamiltonians with spin invariants, which are all the possible interaction forms allowed by symmetry, are built by a new and general developed method. Application of this method to 2D magnet Fe3GeTe2 leads to discovery of diverse skyrmionic phases, with their origins being determined to be multiple fourth order interactions with novel expressions.








Abstract
Skyrmionic magnetic states are promising in advanced spintronics. This topic is experiencing recent progress in 2D magnets, with, for example, a near 300 K Curie temperature observed in Fe3GeTe2. However, despite previous studies reporting skyrmions in Fe3GeTe2, such a system remains elusive, since it has been reported to host either N&#233;el&#8208;type or Bloch&#8208;type textures, while a net Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) cannot occur in this compound for symmetry reasons. It is thus desirable to develop an accurate model to deeply understand Fe3GeTe2. Here, a newly developed method adopting spin invariants is applied to build a first&#8208;principle&#8208;based Hamiltonian, which predicts colorful topological defects assembled from the unit of Bloch lines, and reveals the critical role of specific forms of fourth&#8208;order interactions in Fe3GeTe2. Rather than the DMI, it is the multiple fourth&#8208;order interactions, with symmetry and spin&#8211;orbit couplings considered, that stabilize both N&#233;el&#8208;type and Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions, as well as antiskyrmions, without any preference for clockwise versus counterclockwise spin rotation. This study also demonstrates that spin invariants can be used as a general approach to study complex magnetic interactions.

         <title>Ultrafast Shaped Laser Induced Synthesis of MXene Quantum Dots/Graphene for Transparent Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers an in situ, one&#8208;step strategy using temporally and spatially shapedlaser for simultaneous photochemically synthesizing of the transparent MXene quantum dot/laser reduced graphene oxide composite electrodes with ultrahigh transparency and energy storage. A new process for preparing transparent electrode is proposed, which also takes into account both high transparency and performance.








Abstract
Ultratransparent electrodes have attracted considerable attention in optoelectronics and energy technology. However, balancing energy storage capability and transparency remains challenging. Herein, an in situ strategy employing a temporally and spatially shaped femtosecond laser is reported for photochemically synthesizing of MXene quantum dots (MQDs) uniformly attached to laser reduced graphene oxide (LRGO) with exceptional electrochemical capacitance and ultrahigh transparency. The mechanism and plasma dynamics of the synthesis process are analyzed and observed at the same time. The unique MQDs loaded on LRGO greatly improve the specific surface area of the electrode due to the nanoscale size and additional edge states. The MQD/LRGO supercapacitor has high flexibility and durability, ultrahigh energy density (2.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2), long cycle life (97.6% after 12&#160;000 cycles), and excellent capacitance (10.42&#160;mF cm&#8722;2) with both high transparency (transmittance over 90%) and high performance. Furthermore, this method provides a means of preparing nanostructured composite electrode materials and exploiting quantum capacitance effects for energy storage.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Lipid Nanotherapeutic Boost for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase III clinical trials of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Here, dual&#8208;targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer. T&#8208;iLNTB boosts chemotherapeutic effect in cancer cells, increases an immunogenic cell death and reprograms tumor myeloid cells, consequently, recruits T cells and boosts responsiveness to immunotherapeutics. T&#8208;iLNTB can become a novel therapeutic modality in cancer.








Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO1) is shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1&#8208;targeted therapeutics can become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1&#8208;inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell&#8208; and cancer cell&#8208;dual targeted HO1&#8208;inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed using RNAi&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles. T&#8208;iLNTB&#8208;mediated HO1&#8208;inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T&#8208;iLNTB induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold&#8208;to&#8208;Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy. Finally, ex vivo study proves that HO1&#8208;inhibition directly affects tumor macrophage differentiation.

     alt="Dual-Targeted Lipid Nanotherapeutic Boost for Chemo-Immunotherapy of Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase III clinical trials of chemo-immunotherapy suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Here, dual-targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T-iLNTB) is developed for chemo-immunotherapy of cancer. T-iLNTB boosts chemotherapeutic effect in cancer cells, increases an immunogenic cell death and reprograms tumor myeloid cells, consequently, recruits T cells and boosts responsiveness to immunotherapeutics. T-iLNTB can become a novel therapeutic modality in cancer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemo-immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard-of-care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo-immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) is shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1-targeted therapeutics can become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo-immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1-inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell- and cancer cell-dual targeted HO1-inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T-iLNTB) is developed using RNAi-loaded lipid nanoparticles. T-iLNTB-mediated HO1-inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard-of-care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T-iLNTB induces CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold-to-Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy. Finally, ex vivo study proves that HO1-inhibition directly affects tumor macrophage differentiation. This study demonstrates the potential of T-iLNTB as a novel therapeutic modality for boosting chemo-immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Super Water&#8208;Extracting Gels for Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management in the Hydrological Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super water&#8208;extracting gels (SWEGs) based on hypercrosslinked hydrophilic polymeric networks are developed for pure vapor generation powered by sunlight. SWEGs reject volatile solutes in water and their dynamic hydrogen bonding networks allow water transport for evaporation. SWEGs achieve a VOCs removal ratio up to 99.99% by solar distillation under 1 sun.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are widely spread in the natural hydrological cycle, contaminating potential water sources, and leading to unexpected ecological hazards. However, water&#8208;purification technologies toward VOCs are energy&#8208;intensive and present unsatisfactory purity of the obtained water. The fundamental challenge is to differentiate the motion of water and VOC molecules by separators. Here, the concept of a super water&#8208;extracting gel (SWEG) for VOC&#8208;management and water purification via direct solar distillation is proposed. The strong hydrogen bonding effect in the hypercrosslinked hydrophilic polymeric networks enables the SWEG to extract water from VOC&#8208;containing water, which rejects the VOC solutes while allowing water through for interfacial evaporation. The obtained SWEG achieves a VOCs removal ratio up to 99.99% by solar distillation under 1 sun. A solar water&#8208;purification system is also demonstrated to produce clean water, which surpasses other competitive technologies based on electricity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric conversion has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In this review, the thermoelectric microscopy&#8208;based quantum sensing of thermopower from classical, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, collective spin dynamics, and relativistic effect is summarized. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials provide insights for the future thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Thermoelectric power, has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In addition to classical and macroscopic values, thermopower also varies locally over a wide range of length scales, and is fundamentally linked to electron wave functions and phonon propagation. Various experimental methods for the quantum sensing of localized thermopower have been suggested, particularly based on scanning probe microscopy. Here, critical advances in the quantum sensing of thermopower are introduced, from the atomic to the several&#8208;hundred&#8208;nanometer scales, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects for optimized power generation. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications. Quantum sensing techniques for thermopower can pave the way to practical and novel energy devices for a sustainable society.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials for Emerging Quantum Phenomena and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron&#8211;electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many&#8208;body interactions and holds substantial promise for next&#8208;generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

         <title>Commensurate Stacking Phase Transitions in an Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transitions at around 230 K in Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high&#8208;temperature phase with ABC stacking and R3m symmetry to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low temperature phase again with R3m symmetry, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0].








Abstract
Intercalation and stacking&#8208;order modulation are two active ways in manipulating the interlayer interaction of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which lead to a variety of emergent phases and allow for engineering material properties. Herein, the growth of Pb&#8208;intercalated TMDCs&#8211;Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2, the first 124&#8208;phase, is reported. Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 exhibits a unique two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transition at around 230 K. The transitions are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high&#8208;temperature (high&#8208;T) phase with ABC stacking and R3m symmetry to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low&#8208;temperature (low&#8208;T) phase again with R3msymmetry, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0]. Intriguingly, gigantic lattice contractions occur at the transitions on warming. At low&#8208;T, bulk superconductivity with Tc&#160;&#8776; 1.8 K is observed. The underlying physics of the structural phase transitions are discussed from first&#8208;principle calculations. The symmetry analysis reveals topological nodal lines in the band structure. The results demonstrate the possibility of realizing higher&#8208;order metal&#8208;intercalated phases of TMDCs and advance the knowledge of polymorphic transitions, and may inspire stacking&#8208;order engineering in TMDCs and&#160;beyond.

         <title>Optimizing Atomic Hydrogen Desorption of Sulfur&#8208;Rich NiS1+x Cocatalyst for Boosting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient coupling strategy of active&#8208;site&#8208;enriched regulation and electronic structure modification of active S sites is developed to simultaneously increase the active S number and weaken the strong S&#63743;Hads bonds. The designed core&#8211;shell Au@NiS1+x cocatalyst with electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722; active centers can realize the facile adsorption and desorption of atomic hydrogen, thus achieving signally boosted photocatalytic H2&#8208;evolution activity on TiO2.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (MSx) are demonstrated to be potential candidate cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation. However, their H2&#8208;generation performance is limited by insufficient quantities of exposed sulfur (S) sites and their strong bonding with adsorbed hydrogen atoms (S&#63743;Hads). To address these issues, an efficient coupling strategy of active&#8208;site&#8208;enriched regulation and electronic structure modification of active S sites is developed by rational design of core&#8211;shell Au@NiS1+x nanostructured cocatalyst. In this case, the Au@NiS1+x cocatalyst can be skillfully fabricated to synthesize the Au@NiS1+x modified TiO2 (denoted as TiO2/Au@NiS1+x) by a two&#8208;step route. Photocatalytic experiments exhibit that the resulting TiO2/Au@NiS1+x(1.7:1.3) displays a boosted H2&#8208;generation rate of 9616&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 46.0%&#160; at 365&#160;nm, which is 2.9 and 1.7 times the rate over TiO2/NiS1+x and TiO2/Au, respectively. In situ/ex situ XPS characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the free&#8208;electrons of Au can transfer to sulfur&#8208;enriched NiS1+x to induce the generation of electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722; active centers, which boosts the desorption of Hads for rapid hydrogen formation via weakening the strong S&#63743;Hads bonds. Hence, an electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722;&#8208;mediated mechanism is proposed. This work delivers a universal strategy for simultaneously increasing the active site number and optimizing the binding strength between the active sites and hydrogen adsorbates.

         <title>A General Strategy to Immobilize Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a general strategy with SnO2 as a mediator onto metal&#8211;oxo clusters via a two&#8208;step microwave&#8208;assisted modification approach. Remarkably, the H2 production efficiency of Pt1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under visible light surpasses that of Cu1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Ni1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, surpassing that of their corresponding metal nanoparticles (NPs) by far.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are witnessing rapid development due to their high activity and selectivity toward diverse reactions. However, it remains a grand challenge in the general synthesis of SACs, particularly featuring an identical chemical microenvironment and on the same support. Herein, a universal synthetic protocol is developed to immobilize SACs in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Significantly, by means of SnO2 as a mediator or adaptor, not only different single&#8208;atom metal sites, such as Pt, Cu, and Ni, etc., can be installed, but also the MOF supports can be changed (for example, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PCN&#8208;222, and DUT&#8208;67) to afford M1/SnO2/MOF architecture. Taking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as a representative, the Pt1/SnO2/MOF exhibits approximately five times higher activity toward photocatalytic H2 production than the corresponding Pt nanoparticles (&#8776;2.5&#160;nm) stabilized by SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, despite featuring identical parameters in the chemical microenvironment and support in M1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the Pt1 catalyst possesses a hydrogen evolution rate of 2167 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, superior to the Cu1 and Ni1 counterparts, which is attributed to the differentiated hydrogen binding free energies, as supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. This is thought to be the first report on a universal approach toward the stabilization of SACs with identical chemical microenvironment on an identical support.

A mechanochemical route to prepare stoichiometric&#8208;pure and air&#8208;stable &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders is developed, which can be stored for more than 10 months in ambient environment. Redissolving the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders can generate a high concentration of large&#8208;sized polyiodide colloids, which can serve as nuclei to promote heterogeneous nucleation for perovskite films. As a result, a competitive solar cell efficiency of 24.22% is achieved.








Abstract
A prerequisite for commercializing perovskite photovoltaics is to develop a swift and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis route, which guarantees the mass production of halide perovskites in the industry. Herein, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted mechanochemical strategy is developed for fast synthesizing a stoichiometric &#948;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3) powder, which serves as a high&#8208;purity precursor for perovskite film deposition with low defects. The presynthesized &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 precursor possesses high concentration of micrometer&#8208;sized colloids, which are in favor of preferable crystallization by spontaneous nucleation. The resultant perovskite films own preferred crystal orientations of cubic (100) plane, which is beneficial for superior carrier transport compared to that of the films with isotropic crystal orientations using &#8220;mixture of PbI2 and FAI&#8221; as precursors. As a result, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.2% are obtained. Moreover, the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powder shows superior storage stability for more than 10 months in ambient environment (40&#160;&#177; 10% relative humidity), being conducive to a facile and practical storage for further commercialization.

Through precious solvent molecule/Mg ion sieve owing to the angstrom&#8208;sized aperture window, the MOF membrane suppresses the solvent reduction and enables a low migration barrier for Mg2+ transportation within this MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Metallic magnesium batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries; however, a passive interfacial layer because of the electro&#8208;reduction of solvents on Mg surfaces usually leads to ultrahigh overpotential for the reversible Mg chemistry. Inspired by the excellent separation effect of permselective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) at angstrom scale, a large&#8208;area and defect&#8208;free MOF membrane directly on Mg surfaces is here constructed. In this process, the electrochemical deprotonation of ligand can be facilitated to afford the self&#8208;correcting of intercrystalline voids until a seamless membrane formed, which can eliminate nonselective intercrystalline diffusion of electrolyte and realize selective Mg2+ transport but precisely separate the solvent molecules from the MOF channels. Compared with the continuous solvent reduction on bare Mg anode, the as&#8208;constructed MOF membrane is demonstrated to significantly stabilize the Mg electrode via suppressing the permeation of solvents, hence contributing to a low&#8208;overpotential plating/stripping in conventional electrolytes. The concept is demonstrated that membrane separation can serve as solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which would be widely applicable to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Intrinsic Wettability in Pristine Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of environmental scanning electron microscope, the high hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene with an extremely low water contact angle of &#8776;30&#176; is confirmed, using the suspended, superclean graphene membrane to exclude the interference by substrates and contamination. This high hydrophilicity is revealed to originate from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8211;&#960; interaction.








Abstract
The wettability of graphene remains controversial owing to its high sensitivity to the surroundings, which is reflected by the wide range of reported water contact angle (WCA). Specifically, the surface contamination and underlying substrate would strongly alter the intrinsic wettability of graphene. Here, the intrinsic wettability of graphene is investigated by measuring WCA on suspended, superclean graphene membrane using environmental scanning electron microscope. An extremely low WCA with an average value &#8776;30&#176; is observed, confirming the hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene. This high hydrophilicity originates from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8211;&#960; interaction. The work provides a deep understanding of the water&#8211;graphene interaction and opens up a new way for measuring the surface properties of 2D materials.

         <title>Stretchable Soft Composites with Strain&#8208;Induced Architectured Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;changing composites are manufactured using magnetically aligned coated platelets dispersed in a stretchable polymer matrix. Stretching of such composites enables color change through the strain&#8208;induced rotation of the embedded reflecting platelets. By harnessing the concept of architectured color, the composites feature unique direction&#8208;selective coloration effects that can be exploited in low&#8208;energy optical displays, robotic actuators, and soft tactile sensors.








Abstract
Colors enable interaction and communication between living species in a myriad of biological and artificial environments. While living organisms feature low&#8208;power mechanisms to dynamically control color in soft tissues, man&#8208;made color&#8208;changing devices remain predominantly rigid and energy intensive. Here, architectured composites that display striking color changes when stretched in selective directions under ambient light with minimum power input are reported. The orientation&#8208;dependent color change results from the rotation of reflective coated platelets that are embedded in a soft polymer matrix and pre&#8208;aligned in a well&#8208;defined architecture. The light reflected by the platelets generates structural color defined by the oxide coating on the platelet surface. By magnetically programming the initial orientation and spatial distribution of selected platelets within the soft matrix, composites with strain&#8208;modulated color&#8208;changing effects that cannot be achieved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies are created. The proposed concept of strain&#8208;induced architectured color can be harnessed to develop low&#8208;power smart stretchable displays, tactile synthetic skins, and autonomous soft robotic devices that undergo fast and reversible color changes through the mechano&#8208;optic coupling programmed within their soft composite architecture.

         <title>Paper without a Trail: Time&#8208;Dependent Encryption using Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Invisible Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;erasing ink that can display information on time scales based on the incorporated photochromic spiropyran and host&#8211;guest crosslinkers is reported. Upon the addition of a competitive host or guest, disassembly of the crosslinks occurs. This reduces the extent of merocyanine aggregation and accelerates the decay periods that control the information displayed at various time points.








Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive invisible ink for time&#8208;dependent encryption of information is reported. Consisting of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular network grafted with spiropyran moieties, these materials display time&#8208;dependent photochromic behavior with tailorable fading rates. Ultraviolet (UV) light results in isomerization of the colorless spiropyran to the corresponding colored merocyanine, while visible light or heat causes the reverse isomerization with a rate that is dependent on the density of host&#8211;guest crosslinks. The kinetics of discoloration are a function of merocyanine aggregation, which becomes more pronounced as the host&#8211;guest crosslink density is increased, leading to a reduced conversion rate and slower time&#8208;dependent fading. The degree of crosslinking, and hence the fading rate, may be modulated via the addition of unbound pillar[5]arene host or nitrile guest as competitors. Time&#8208;dependent information encryption is enabled by combining selective placement of host and guest competitors and UV patterning. UV patterning provides an initially &#8220;false&#8221; image that does not reveal the desired information, and it is only after a given time that the encrypted data appears. This work provides a unique approach to enhance the security of information storage associated with offline portable data encryption.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Mediated Dynamic Modulation of Perovskite Crystallization for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic strategy is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;quality perovskite films through resonance modulation, leading to a Voc of 1.16 V and high power conversion efficiencies approaching 22.0% and 19.5% for small&#8208;area (0.09&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area (1.02&#160;cm2) inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), respectively. More importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs exhibit excellent long&#8208;term stability under various environmental conditions (moisture, light, and heat).








Abstract
Manipulating perovskite crystallization to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films is the key to achieving highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a dynamic strategy is proposed to modulate perovskite crystallization using a resonance hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) capable of fast self&#8208;adaptive tautomerization between multiple electronic states with neutral and charged resonance forms for mediating perovskite crystal growth and defect passivation in situ. This approach, based on resonance variation with self&#8208;adaptive molecular interactions between the HTM and the perovskite, produces high&#8208;quality perovskite films with smooth surface, oriented crystallization, and low charge recombination, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies approaching 22% for small&#8208;area devices (0.09&#160;cm2) and up to 19.5% for large&#8208;area devices (1.02&#160;cm2). Also, remarkably high stability of the PSCs is observed, retaining over 90%, 88%, or 83% of the initial efficiencies in air with relative humidity of 40&#8211;50%, under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination, or at 75&#160;&#176;C&#160;annealing for 1000 h without encapsulation.

         <title>Reaching the Excitonic Limit in 2D Janus Monolayers by In Situ Deterministic Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deterministic conversion of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to Janus quantum layers is achieved via a novel synthesis approach. Integrated in situ spectroscopy measurements enable detailed insights into classical TMDs to Janus layer conversion to reach excitonic&#8208;grade Janus layer.








Abstract
Named after the two&#8208;faced Roman god of transitions, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) Janus monolayers have two different chalcogen surfaces, inherently breaking the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror symmetry. The broken mirror symmetry and the resulting potential gradient lead to the emergence of quantum properties such as the Rashba effect and the formation of dipolar excitons. Experimental access to these quantum properties, however, hinges on the ability to produce high&#8208;quality 2D Janus monolayers. Here, these results introduce a holistic 2D Janus synthesis technique that allows real&#8208;time monitoring of the growth process. This prototype chamber integrates in situ spectroscopy, offering fundamental insights into the structural evolution and growth kinetics, that allow the evaluation and optimization of the quality of Janus monolayers. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by synthesizing and monitoring the conversion of SWSe, SNbSe, and SMoSe Janus monolayers. Deterministic conversion and real&#8208;time data collection further aid in conversion of exfoliated TMDs to Janus monolayers and unparalleled exciton linewidth values are reached, compared to the current best standard. The results offer an insight into the process kinetics and aid in the development of new Janus monolayers with high optical quality, which is much needed to access their exotic properties.

         <title>Reconfiguring Colors of Single Relief Structures by Directional Stretching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relief structures in an elastomer that exhibit reconfigurable colors from individual micro&#8208;/nanostructures are designed and experimentally demonstrated. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, individual trench segments can act as a single color pixel with high resolution. Multiple sets of colorful microprints are accessible from monolithic reliefs by directional strains and capillary effects.








Abstract
Color changes can be achieved by straining photonic crystals or gratings embedded in stretchable materials. However, the multiple repeat units and the need for a volumetric assembly of nanostructures limit the density of information content. Inspired by surface reliefs on oracle bones and music records as a means of information archival, here, surface&#8208;relief elastomers are endowed with multiple sets of information that are accessible by mechanical straining along in&#8208;plane axes. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, trenches that generate color due to variations in trench depth, enabling individual trench segments to support a single color, are reported. Using 3D printed cuboids, trenches of varying geometric parameters are replicated in elastomers. These parameters determine the initial color (or lack thereof), the response to capillary forces, and the appearance when strained along or across the trenches. Strain induces modulation in trench depth or the opening and closure of a trench, resulting in surface reliefs with up to six distinct states, and an initially featureless surface that reveals two distinct images when stretched along different axes. The highly reversible structural colors are promising in optical data archival, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and strain&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Anomalous Superconducting Proximity Effect in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 Thin&#8208;Film Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anomalous superconducting proximity effect (SPE) is unveiled in topological insulator (TI)/superconductor Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures. In contrast with the normal SPE that decays with thickness, such an effect occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topologically protected surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop.








Abstract
The superconducting proximity effect (SPE) induces a superconductivity transition in otherwise non&#8208;superconducting thin films in proximity with a superconductor. The SPE usually occurs in real space and decays exponentially with film thickness. Herein, an abnormal SPE in a topological insulator (TI)/superconductor heterostructure is unveiled, which is attributed to the topologically protected surface state. Surprisingly, such abnormal SPE occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topological surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop. Combining transport measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy techniques, the SPE in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures is explored, where Bi2Se3 is an ideal 3D topological insulator and FeSe0.5Te0.5 a typical iron&#8208;based superconductor. As the thickness of the Bi2Se3 thin film exceeds 400 nm, there still exists SPE&#8208;induced superconductivity on the surface of Bi2Se3 thin film with a transition temperature Tc not less than 10 K. Such an extraordinary behavior is induced by the unique properties of topologically protected surface states of Bi2Se3. This research deepens the understanding of the important role of topologically protected surface states in the SPE.

         <title>Decoupling Complex Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology in Non&#8208;Fullerene Photovoltaics with Nitrogen K&#8208;Edge Resonant Soft X&#8208;ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is complex and difficult to analyze. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering, utilizing the spatial and orientational contrast from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, chemically determining the phase separation, which decouples the mesoscale complexity for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in high&#8208;efficiency OPVs.








Abstract
Complex morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and other functional soft materials commonly dictates performance. Such complexity in OPVs originates from the mesoscale kinetically trapped non&#8208;equilibrium state, which governs device charge generation and transport. Resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering (RSoXS) has been revolutionary in the exploration of OPV morphology in the past decade due to its chemical and orientation sensitivity. However, for non&#8208;fullerene OPVs, RSoXS analysis near the carbon K&#8208;edge is challenging, due to the chemical similarity of the materials used in active layers. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge RSoXS (NK&#8208;RSoXS), utilizing the spatial and orientational contrasts from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, which allows for determination of phase separation. NK&#8208;RSoXS clearly visualizes the combined feature sizes in PM6:Y6 blends from crystallization and liquid&#8211;liquid demixing, while PM6:Y6:Y6&#8208;BO ternary blends with reduced phase&#8208;separation size and enhanced material crystallization can lead to current amplification in devices. Nitrogen is common in organic semiconductors and other soft materials, and the strong and directional N 1s &#8594; &#960;* resonances make NK&#8208;RSoXS a powerful tool to uncover the mesoscale complexity and open opportunities to understand heterogeneous systems.

         <dc:description>
The thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) self&#8208;powered pressure sensor developed can output a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow. A portable/wearable smart face mask is obtained based on the sensor and is used for wireless monitoring and analysis of various breath conditions from multiple testers.

A smart face mask that can conveniently monitor breath information is beneficial for maintaining personal health and preventing the spread of diseases. However, some challenges still need to be addressed before such devices can be of practical use. One key challenge is to develop a pressure sensor that is easily triggered by low pressure and has excellent stability as well as electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, a wireless smart face mask is designed by integrating an ultrathin self&#8208;powered pressure sensor and a compact readout circuit with a normal face mask. The pressure sensor is the thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) electrostatic pressure sensor capable of achieving a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow, which endows the sensor with the advantage of readout circuit miniaturization and makes the breath&#8208;monitoring system portable and wearable. To demonstrate the capabilities of the smart face mask, it is used to wirelessly measure and analyze the various breath conditions of multiple testers.

         <title>Stabilization of Exposed Metal Nanocrystals in High&#8208;Temperature Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial oxide coating strategy is developed for the stabilization of exposed metal nanocrystals to enhance their performance in thermal reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of high&#8208;quality colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Colloidal metal nanocrystals with uniform sizes, shapes, compositions, and architectures are ideal building blocks for constructing heterogeneous catalysts with well&#8208;defined characteristics toward the investigation of accurate structure&#8211;property relationships and better understanding of catalytic mechanism. However, their applications in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis are often restricted by the difficulty in maintaining the high metal dispersity and easy accessibility to active sites under harsh operating conditions. Here, a partial&#8208;oxide&#8208;coating strategy is proposed to stabilize metal nanocrystals against sintering and meanwhile enable an effective exposure of active sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, controlled partial silica coating of colloidally prepared Pd0.82Ni0.18 nanocrystals with the size of 8 nm is demonstrated. This partially coated catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability, outperforming its counterparts with fully coated and supported structures, in reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high operating temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Orbital Gating Driven by Giant Stark Effect in Tunneling Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital gating is introduced driven by giant Stark effect in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in conventional photogating, which realizes low dark current, practical photoresponsivity, and fast switching time simultaneously.








Abstract
Conventional gating in transistors uses electric fields through external dielectrics that require complex fabrication processes. Various optoelectronic devices deploy photogating by electric fields from trapped charges in neighbor nanoparticles or dielectrics under light illumination. Orbital gating driven by giant Stark effect is demonstrated in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in photogating. The original self&#8208;gating by light illumination modulates the interlayer potential gradient by switching on and off the giant Stark effect where the dz2&#8208;orbitals of molybdenum atoms play the dominant role. The orbital gating shifts the electronic bands of the top atomic layer of the MoTe2 by up to 100 meV, which is equivalent to modulation of a carrier density of 7.3 &#215; 1011 cm&#8211;2 by electrical gating. Suppressing conventional photoconductivity, the orbital gating in tunneling phototransistors achieves low dark current, practical photoresponsivity (3357 AW&#8211;1), and fast switching time (0.5&#160;ms) simultaneously.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Cathode with Dual Energy&#8208;Storage Mechanism for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism is detected in an organic (ethylenediamine (EDA))&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathode. Both the EDA ligand and the V&#8211;O layer can participate in Zn&#8208;ion storage synchronously. Benefiting from the advanced mechanism, this hybrid provides a high specific capacity, elevated voltage, and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
The exploitation of cathode materials with high capacity as well as high operating voltage is extremely important for the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet, the classical high&#8208;capacity materials (e.g., vanadium&#8208;based materials) provide a low discharge voltage, while organic cathodes with high operating voltage generally suffer from a low capacity. In this work, organic (ethylenediamine)&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathodes, that is, EDA&#8208;VO, with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism, are designed for ultrahigh&#8208;rate and ultralong&#8208;life ZIBs. The embedded ethylenediamine (EDA) can not only increase the layer spacing of the vanadium oxide, with improved mobility of Zn ions in the V&#8211;O layered structure, but also act as a bidentate chelating ligand participating in the storage of Zn ions. This hybrid provides a high specific capacity (382.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), elevated voltage (0.82&#160;V) and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Assistant density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the cathode has remarkable electronic conductivity, with an ultralow diffusion barrier of 0.78&#160;eV for an optimal Zn&#8208;ion diffusion path in the EDA&#8208;VO. This interesting idea of building organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cathode materials with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism opens a new research direction toward high&#8208;energy secondary batteries.

         <title>Controlling and Focusing In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with a Curved Plasmonic Antenna</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in van der Waals &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are realized with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. By engineering the curvature of the antenna extremity, it is able to tune the focal lengths and lateral sizes of the focal points. This study can open up new avenues for planar nanophotonic devices in the mid&#8208;IR region.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) sustained in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals exhibit extraordinary confinement of long&#8208;wave electromagnetic fields to the deep subwavelength scale. In stark contrast to uniaxial vdW hyperbolic materials, recently emerged biaxial hyperbolic materials, such as &#945;&#8208;MoO3 and &#945;&#8208;V2O5, offer new degrees of freedom for controlling light in two&#8208;dimensions due to their distinctive in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersions. However, the control and focusing of these in&#8208;plane HPhPs remain elusive. Here, a versatile technique is proposed for launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane HPhPs in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. It is found that the subwavelength manipulation and focusing behaviors are strongly dependent on the curvature of the antenna extremity. This strategy operates effectively in a broadband spectral region. These findings not only provide fundamental insights into the manipulation of light by biaxial hyperbolic crystals at the nanoscale but also open up new opportunities for planar nanophotonic applications.

These findings not only provide fundamental insights into the manipulation of light by biaxial hyperbolic crystals at the nanoscale but also open up new opportunities for planar nanophotonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer Acceptors with Flexible Spacers Afford Efficient and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New polymer acceptors (PAs) are developed by embedding flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) units into the rigid backbones. The incorporation of FCBS affords effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PA and attains optimal blend morphology. As a result, the all&#8208;polymer solar cells exhibit both a high efficiency of 14.68% and excellent mechanical robustness with a crack onset strain of 21.64%.








Abstract
High efficiency and mechanical robustness are both crucial for the practical applications of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) in stretchable and wearable electronics. In this regard, a series of new polymer acceptors (PAs) is reported by incorporating a flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) to achieve highly efficient and mechanically robust all&#8208;PSCs. Incorporation of FCBS affords the effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PAs, and achieves the optimal blend morphology with polymer donor (PD), increasing both the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of all&#8208;PSCs. In particular, an all&#8208;PSC based on PYTS&#8208;0.3 PA incorporated with 30% FCBS and PBDB&#8208;T PD demonstrates a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68% and excellent mechanical stretchability with a crack onset strain (COS) of 21.64% and toughness of 3.86&#160;MJ m&#8208;3, which is significantly superior to those of devices with the PA without the FCBS (PYTS&#8208;0.0, PCE = 13.01%, and toughness = 2.70&#160;MJ m&#8208;3). To date, this COS is the highest value reported for PSCs with PCEs of over 8% without any insulating additives. These results reveal that the introduction of FCBS into the conjugated backbone is a highly feasible strategy to simultaneously improve the PCE and stretchability of PSCs.

         <dc:description>
A proposed octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA)&#8208;treated indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si heterostructure photodetector exhibits an excellent on/off current ratio of 4 &#215; 103 and unique negative differential resistance (NDR) current behavior, after implementation with a simple annealing process. Uniformity tests using 156 photodiodes and a 20&#160;000 cycle test demonstrate the reliability of the proposed photodiode.








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductors are of great interest for enabling advanced photodetectors. However, operational instability and the absence of an appropriate doping technique hinder practical development and commercialization. Here, a strategy is proposed to dramatically increase the conventional photodetection performance, having superior stability in operational and environmental atmospheres. By performing energy&#8208;band engineering through an octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) self&#8208;assembled&#8208;monolayer&#8208;based doping treatment, the proposed indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si heterointerface devices exhibit greatly enhance the photoresponsive characteristics, including a photoswitching current ratio with a 100&#8208;fold increase, and photoresponsivity and detectivity with a 15&#8208;fold increase each. The observed ODPA doping effects are investigated through comprehensive analysis with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Furthermore, the proposed photodetectors, fabricated at a 4 in. wafer scale, demonstrate its excellent operation robustness with consistent performance over 237 days and 20&#160;000 testing cycles.

Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica aerogels, serving as a diffuser, show an incredibly promising application in laser&#8208;driven lighting.








Abstract
Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica&#8208;aerogel monolith with spherical building blocks of &#8776;24&#8211;40&#160;nm, together with a deliberately created hole along the incident light direction, shows an incredibly promising application in monochromatic laser&#8208;driven lighting. The resulting coefficient of illuminance variation is as low as 8.1%, significantly outperforming commercially available ground&#8208;glass diffusers (139.0%) and polymer diffusers (249.1%); the speckle contrast is lower, as well as better, than that can be recognized by the human eye (4%), and the illuminance uniformity in the range of 0.770&#8211;0.862 is much better (higher) than that indoor workplace lighting required by the International Organization for Standardization. Lighting with any color in the visible spectrum, including white, can be obtained by using three primary color lasers (450, 532, and 638&#160;nm) with different powers simultaneously as the light source. The resulting silica aerogel, which has excellent thermal stability, high laser&#8208;damage threshold, outstanding mechanical performance, and superhydrophobicity, can be further applied to long&#8208;distance and noncontact laser&#8208;driven lighting in rain or underwater without any additional encapsulation components.

         <title>Strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Stabilized Nanophotosensitizers: Improving Tumor Retention for Enhanced Therapy for Large Tumors in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles encapsulating BODIPY photosensitizers with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking are prepared, demonstrating long tumor retention of up to 10 days. The nanoparticles can completely suppress regular test size tumors (100 mm3) in mice by one&#8208;time radiation. Importantly, the nanoparticles also allow treatment of large&#8208;size tumors (350 mm3) via single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in a 90% inhibition rate.








Abstract
Conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often show poor tumor retention and are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream, which is one of the key hindrances to guarantee precise and efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. In this work, a photosensitizer assembly nanosystem that sharply enhances tumor retention up to &#8776;10 days is present. The PSs are synthesized by meso&#8208;substituting anthracene onto a BODIPY scaffold (AN&#8208;BDP), which then self&#8208;assembles into stable nanoparticles (AN&#8208;BDP NPs) with amphiphilic block copolymers due to the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of the anthracene. Additionally, the incorporated anthracene excites the PSs, producing singlet oxygen under red&#8208;light irradiation. Although AN&#8208;BDP NPs can completely suppress regular test size tumors (&#8776;100 mm3) by one&#8208;time radiation, only 12% tumor growth inhibition rate is observed in the case of large&#8208;size tumors (&#8776;350 mm3) under the same conditions. Due to the long&#8208;time tumor retention, AN&#8208;BDP NPs allow single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in an inhibition rate over 90%, much more efficient than single&#8208;time radiation of conventional clinically used PSs including chlorin&#8208;e6 (Ce6) and porphyrin with poor tumor retention. The results reveal the importance of long tumor retention time of PSs for efficient PDT, which can accelerate the clinical development of nanophotosensitizers.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Responsive TiO2 Biometasurfaces: Toward In Situ Photodynamic Antibacterial Therapy for Biomedical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface is constructed on a Ti alloy by a newly invented alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal (aaBH) strategy, which manipulates the light&#8211;matter interaction and induces the strong adsorption of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The aaBH&#8208;treated Ti alloy implants show potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity and possess a strong ability to promote the anchorage of human gingival fibroblasts on their surface.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;related microbial infection is a challenging clinical problem, and its treatment requires efficient eradication of the biofilm from the implant surface. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive strategies are proposed as an emerging efficient antibacterial therapy. However, the utilization of photosensitizers or photocatalytic/photothermal nanomaterials in the available approach likely induces high potential risks of interfacial deterioration and biosafety compromise. Herein, a TiO2/TiO2&#8722;x metasurface with potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity is produced on a Ti alloy implant by a newly invented topochemical conversion&#8208;based alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal method (aaBH). Electromagnetic simulations prove that NIR absorption and near&#8208;field distribution of the metasurface can be tuned by the dimension and arrangement of the nanostructural unit. Promising antibacterial efficacy is proved by both in vitro and in vivo tests, with low&#8208;power NIR irradiation for 10 min. Besides, the designed nanostructure in the metasurface itself also shows excellence in enhancing the adhesion&#8208;related gene expression of human gingival fibroblasts that are exposed to 10 min of NIR irradiation, proving the potent nanostructure&#8208;induced biological effects. This work provides a biosafe and upscalable metasurfacing approach with extraordinary capacity of manipulating light adsorption, photocatalysis, and biological properties.

         <title>Biomimetic Trachea Engineering via a Modular Ring Strategy Based on Bone&#8208;Marrow Stem Cells and Atelocollagen for Use in Extensive Tracheal Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen scaffold repopulated with bone marrow stem cells for cartilaginous rings regeneration and type&#8208;I atelocollagen scaffold for vascularized fibrous tissue formation is fabricated; then, a modular ring strategy to develop a biomimetic trachea with cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between the vascularized fibrous tissue architecture is adopted. The biomimetic trachea is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic tracheas with a architecture of cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between vascularized fibrous tissue (CRVFT) has the potential to perfectly recapitulate the normal tracheal structure and function. Herein, the development of a customized chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen (COL II/CS) scaffold with excellent chondrogenic capacity and a type&#8208;I atelocollagen (COL I) scaffold to facilitate the formation of vascularized fibrous tissue is described. An efficient modular ring strategy is then adopted to develop a CRVFT&#8208;based biomimetic trachea. The in vitro engineering of cartilaginous rings is achieved via the recellularization of ring&#8208;shaped COL II/CS scaffolds using bone marrow stem cells as a mimetic for native cartilaginous ring tissue. A CRVFT&#8208;based trachea with biomimetic mechanical properties, composed of bionic biochemical components, is additionally successfully generated in vivo via the alternating stacking of cartilaginous rings and ring&#8208;shaped COL I scaffolds on a silicone pipe. The resultant biomimetic trachea with pedicled muscular flaps is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction and exhibits satisfactory therapeutic outcomes with structural and functional properties similar to those of native trachea. This is the first study to utilize stem cells for long&#8208;segmental tracheal cartilaginous regeneration and this represents a promising method for extensive tracheal reconstruction.

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Linking&#8208;Enabled Superior Compatibility of ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Membrane for Efficient Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superior interfacial compatibility in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) hybrid membranes is achieved by linking functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 and polymeric PIM&#8208;1 through chemical bonds. The fabricated membrane exhibits the highest C3H6 permeability and remarkable selectivity for C3H6 over C3H8 among ZIF analogs, potentially for efficient propylene separation.








Abstract
The interface is a critical issue for metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework hybrid membranes in propylene separation. Here, a covalent&#8208;linking strategy is reported for strikingly reinforcing the interfacial compatibility in a ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based membrane. A functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 material named ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN is synthesized using the mixed&#8208;ligand approach. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN has an identical crystalline structure to ZIF&#8208;8, and the 4,5&#8208;dicyanoimidazole ligand is available for further functionalization. Covalent linkage of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN with PIM&#8208;1 is driven by the thermal reaction of the cyano groups on both entities, which strengthens the filler&#8211;polymer connection in the ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 membrane. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 exhibits remarkably enhanced propylene permeation property with C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of &#8776;28, which is 350% and 180% higher than those on non&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN/PIM&#8208;1 and non&#8208;functionalized ZIF&#8208;8@tPIM&#8208;1, respectively. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 shows the highest C3H6 permeability of &#8776;370 Barrer among all relevant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. This strategy opens an avenue for precise interface engineering in membranes and the resultant high performance is appealing in the propylene separation industry.

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Interactions in Nonfullerene Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy, Crystallographic Modelling, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined results from solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and modelling techniques highlight key differences in the Y6 morphology in PM6:Y6 blends cast from different solvents, which lead to different power conversion efficiencies in solar cells. By interpreting the experimental data step&#8208;by&#8208;step and using the results from each step, a more complete understanding of the underlying fundamental processes is reached.








Abstract
Fused&#8208;ring core nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), designated &#8220;Y&#8208;series,&#8221; have enabled high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) achieving over 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since the introduction of these NFAs, much effort has been expended to understand the reasons for their exceptional performance. While several studies have identified key optoelectronic properties that govern high PCEs, little is known about the molecular level origins of large variations in performance, spanning from 5% to 18% PCE, for example, in the case of PM6:Y6 OSCs. Here, a combined solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and molecular modeling approach to elucidate the atomic&#8208;scale interactions in Y6 crystals, thin films, and PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends is introduced. It is shown that the Y6 morphologies in BHJ blends are not governed by the morphology in neat films or single crystals. Notably, PM6:Y6 blends processed from different solvents self&#8208;assemble into different structures and morphologies, whereby the relative orientations of the sidechains and end groups of the Y6 molecules to their fused&#8208;ring cores play a crucial role in determining the resulting morphology and overall performance of the solar cells. The molecular&#8208;level understanding of BHJs enabled by this approach will guide the engineering of next&#8208;generation NFAs for stable and efficient OSCs.

         <title>Sequential Activation of Molecular and Macroscopic Spin&#8208;State Switching within the Hysteretic Region Following Pulsed Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of an exceptionally reversible bidirectional switching in a molecular spin&#8208;crossover crystal, pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy is used to explore the dynamics of the spin&#8208;state switching within the hysteretic region. Remarkably, before the millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual and homogeneous molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop.








Abstract
Molecular spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) compounds constitute a promising class of photoactive materials exhibiting efficient photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs). Taking advantage of the unique, picture&#8208;perfect reproducibility of the spin&#8208;transition properties in the compound [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], the spatiotemporal dynamics of the PIPT within the thermodynamic metastability (hysteretic) region of a single crystal is dissected, using pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy. Beyond a threshold laser&#8208;excitation density, complete PIPTs are evidenced, with conversion rates up to 200 switched molecules per absorbed photon. It is shown that the PIPT takes place through the sequential activation of two (molecular and macroscopic) switching mechanisms, occurring on sub&#8208;microsecond and millisecond timescales, governed by the intramolecular and free energy barriers of the system, respectively. The main finding here is that the thermodynamic metastability has strictly no influence on the sub&#8208;millisecond switching dynamics. Indeed, before this millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual, molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop. Consequently, in this regime, even a 100% photoinduced conversion may not give rise to a PIPT. These results provide new insight on the intrinsic dynamical limits of the PIPT, which is an important issue from a technological perspective.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon 3D Laser Printing Inside Synthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon 3D laser printing inside of giant unilamellar lipid vesicles is reported. 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape, including transmembrane pores, are realized within the confinement of a synthetic cell.








Abstract
Toward the ambitious goal of manufacturing synthetic cells from the bottom up, various cellular components have already been reconstituted inside lipid vesicles. However, the deterministic positioning of these components inside the compartment has remained elusive. Here, by using two&#8208;photon 3D&#160;laser printing, 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures are manufactured with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape inside preformed giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The required water&#8208;soluble photoresist is brought into the GUVs by diffusion in a single mixing step. Crucially, femtosecond two&#8208;photon printing inside the compartment does not destroy the GUVs. Beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration, early functional architectures are realized. In particular, a transmembrane structure acting as a pore is 3D&#160;printed, thereby allowing for the transport of biological cargo, including DNA, into the synthetic compartment. These experiments show that two&#8208;photon 3D laser microprinting can be an important addition to the existing toolbox of synthetic&#160;biology.

         <title>Auxetics&#8208;Inspired Tunable Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Auxetics refers to structures or materials identified by a negative Poisson's ratio and exhibiting a counterintuitive geometrical behavior. Inspired by auxetics, mechanically tunable magnetic metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz frequencies are proposed, which serve to enhance local magnetic fields and increase signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) in their application to magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Auxetics refers to structures or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby capable of exhibiting counterintuitive behaviors. Herein, auxetic structures are exploited to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies, optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specially, the reported tunable metamaterials are composed of arrays of interjointed unit cells featuring metallic helices, enabling auxetic patterns with a negative Poisson's ratio. The deployable deformation of the metamaterials yields an added degree of freedom with respect to frequency tunability through the resultant modification of the electromagnetic interactions between unit cells. The metamaterials are fabricated using 3D printing technology and an &#8776;20&#160;MHz frequency shift of the resonance mode is enabled during deformation. Experimental validation is performed in a clinical (3.0 T) MRI system, demonstrating that the metamaterials enable a marked boost in radiofrequency field strength under resonance&#8208;matched conditions, ultimately yielding a dramatic increase in the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) of MRI. The tunable metamaterials presented herein offer a novel pathway toward the practical utilization of metamaterials in MRI, as well as a range of other emerging applications.

         <title>Fast Uncooled Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors with Heterostructures of van der Waals on Epitaxial HgCdTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals on epitaxial HgCdTe for uncooled mid&#8208;wavelength infrared photodetectors with fast response and high detectivity at spectral blackbody detection is introduced. Meaningfully, the device exhibits a fast response time of 13 ns, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010 and 1011 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation at 300 K and at 77 K.








Abstract
Uncooled infrared photodetectors have evoked widespread interest in basic research and military manufacturing because of their low&#8208;cost, compact detection systems. However, existing uncooled infrared photodetectors utilize the photothermoelectric effect of infrared radiation operating at 8&#8211;12&#160;&#181;m, with a slow response time in the millisecond range. Hence, the exploration of new uncooled mid&#8208;wavelength infrared (MWIR) heterostructures is conducive to the development of ultrafast and high&#8208;performance nano&#8208;optoelectronics. This study explores a van der Waals heterojunction on epitaxial HgCdTe (vdWs&#8208;on&#8208;MCT) as an uncooled MWIR photodetector, which achieves fast response as well as high detectivity for spectral blackbody detection. Specifically, the vdWs&#8208;on&#8208;MCT photodetector has a fast response time of 13&#160;ns (77&#160;MHz), which is approximately an order of magnitude faster than commercial uncooled MCT photovoltaic photodetectors. Importantly, the device exhibits a photoresponsivity of 2.5 A W&#8208;1, quantum efficiency as high as 85%, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8208;1 under blackbody radiation at room temperature, and peak detectivity of up to 1011&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8208;1 at 77 K. Thereby, this work facilitates the effective design of high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;performance heterojunction uncooled MWIR photodetectors.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Power Mesocarbon Microbeads|Na+&#8208;Diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3 Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype of ultrahigh power sodium ion battery (SIB), mesocarbon microbeads|Na+&#8208;diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3, is assembled. The as&#8208;synthesized Na3V2(PO4)3@C@CNTs cathode and mesocarbon microbeads anode display the well&#8208;matched rate capability. The assembled full&#8208;cell delivers an energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at ultrahigh power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high&#8208;rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite&#8208;type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+&#8208;diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as&#8208;synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na&#8208;diglyme]+ co&#8208;intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well&#8208;matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full&#8208;cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the high power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23&#160;kW kg&#8722;1, an energy density of 58&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high&#8208;power SIB for large&#8208;scale applications in the future.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large-scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high-rate Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (NVP) cathode, graphite-type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as-synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na-diglyme]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well-matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full-cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the high power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23&#160;kW kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, an energy density of 58&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained.

A biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate Rhizopus hyphae carbon fibre (RHCF) and its derivatives is proposed. The RHCFs are multifunctional as the hosts to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form an RHCF&#8208;based cathode, anode, and separator, respectively. The as&#8208;assembled RHCF&#8208;based full cell shows excellent cycling capacity and high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Biotechnology can bring new breakthroughs on design and fabrication of energy materials and devices. In this work, a novel and facile biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate multifunctional Rhizopus hyphae carbon fiber (RHCF) and its derivatives on a large scale for electrochemical energy storage is proposed. Crosslinked hollow carbon fibers are successfully prepared by conversion of Rhizopus hyphae, and macroscopic production of centimeter&#8208;level carbon balls consisting of hollow RHCFs is further realized. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembled RHCF balls show strong adsorption characteristics on metal ions and can be converted into a series of derivatives such as RHCF/metal oxides. Notably, the designed RHCF derivatives are demonstrated with powerful multifunctionability as cathode, anode, and separator for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). The RHCF can act as the host material to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form a new RHCF/CoO&#8208;S cathode, an RHCF/Li anode, and an RHCF/PP separator, respectively. Consequently, the optimized LSB full cell presents excellent cycling performance and superior high&#8208;rate capacity (881.3&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 at 1 C). This work provides a new method for large&#8208;scale preparation of hollow carbon fibers and derivatives for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Realization of Eligibility Traces Based on Conductance Drift of Phase Change Memory for Energy&#8208;Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in&#8208;memory realization of eligibility trace for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning (RL) with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks is presented. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance and significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional computing platforms.








Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown outstanding performance in handling complex tasks in recent years. Eligibility trace (ET), a fundamental and important mechanism in reinforcement learning, records critical states with attenuation and guides the update of policy, which plays a crucial role in accelerating the convergence of RL training. However, ET implementation on conventional digital computing hardware is energy hungry and restricted by the memory wall due to massive calculation of exponential decay functions. Here, in&#8208;memory realization of ET for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks is demonstrated. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance during RL training in various tasks. The spontaneous in&#8208;memory decay computing and storage of policy in the same phase change memory give rise to significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional graphics processing unit platforms. This work therefore provides a holistic energy and hardware efficient method for both training and inference of reinforcement learning.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Doped Titania Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristors for Crossbar Array Neuromorphic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristor is fabricated using in&#160;situ doping with a custom&#8208;designed NaOH reactant during atomic layer deposition growth, where the resulting resistive&#8208;switching mechanism is based on Na migration. By applying these self&#8208;rectifying Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors to a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar array, each of the 36&#160;devices are operated individually without crosstalk disturbance.








Abstract
Memristors integrated into a crossbar&#8208;array architecture (CAA) are promising candidates for nonvolatile memory elements in artificial neural networks. However, the relatively low reliability of memristors coupled with crosstalk and sneak currents in CAAs have limited the realization of the full potential of this technology. Here, high&#8208;reliability Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors grown in&#160;situ by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are demonstrated, where reversible Na migration underlies the resistive&#8208;switching mechanism. By employing ALD growth with an aqueous NaOH reactant in deionized water, uniform implantation of Na dopants is achieved in the crystallized TiO2&#160;thin films at 250&#160;&#176;C without post&#8208;annealing. The resulting Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors show electroforming&#8208;free and self&#8208;rectifying resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and they are ideally suited for selectorless CAAs. Effective addressing of selectorless nodes is demonstrated via electrical measurement of individual memristors in a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar using a read current of less than 1&#160;&#181;A with negligible sneak current at or below the noise level of &#8776;100&#160;pA. Finally, the long&#8208;term potentiation and depression synaptic behavior from these Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors achieves greater than 99.1% accuracy for image&#8208;recognition tasks using a convolutional neural network based on the selectorless of crossbar arrays.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced to enhance the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite solar cells. Moreover, a vertical compositional gradient with a continuous change of the Pb/Sn ratio is found in the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite films, leading to graded heterojunctions that are beneficial for photocarrier separation.

Sn&#8211;Pb mixed perovskites with bandgaps in the range of 1.1&#8211;1.4&#160;eV are ideal candidates for single&#8208;junction solar cells to approach the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still lag far behind those of Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+. Here, a reducing agent 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced as an additive along with SnF2 to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. Meanwhile, a vertical Pb/Sn compositional gradient is formed spontaneously after an antisolvent treatment due to different solubility and crystallization kinetics of Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskites and it can be finely tuned by controlling the antisolvent temperature. Because the band structure of a perovskite is dependent on its composition, graded vertical heterojunctions are constructed in the perovskite films with a compositional gradient, which can enhance photocarrier separation and suppress carrier recombination in the resultant PSCs. Under optimal fabrication conditions, the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed PSCs show power conversion efficiency up to 22% along with excellent stability during light soaking.

&lt;p&gt;4-Hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced to enhance the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed-perovskite solar cells. Moreover, a vertical compositional gradient with a continuous change of the Pb/Sn ratio is found in the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed-perovskite films, leading to graded heterojunctions that are beneficial for photocarrier separation. The resultant devices show a record efficiency up to 22%.

         <title>Unusual Site&#8208;Selective Doping in Layered Cathode Strengthens Electrostatic Cohesion of Alkali&#8208;Metal Layer for Practicable Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Cell</title>

Unusual site&#8208;selective doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for P2&#8208; Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 can effectively restrain P2&#8211;O2 phase transition and prevent material crack due to the enhanced electrostatic cohesions between two transition metal layers, leading to ultralong life span sodium&#8208;ion full cell.








Abstract
P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a dominant cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, charging P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to voltages higher than 4.2&#8201;V (vs. Na+/Na) can induce detrimental structural transformation and severe capacity fading. Herein, stable cycling and moisture resistancy of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 at 4.35&#8201;V (vs. Na+/Na) are achieved through dual&#8208;site doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for the first time. The Cu ion doping in 2a site stabilizes the metal layer, while more importantly, the unusual alkali&#8208;metal site doping by Zn ion serves as O2&#8208;&#63743;Zn2+&#63743;O2&#8208; &#8220;pillar&#8221; for enhancing electrostatic cohesion between two adjacent transition metal layers, preventing the crack of active material along the a&#8211;b&#8208;plane and restraining the generation of O2 phase upon deep desodiation. This unique dual&#8208;site&#8208;doped [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode exhibits a prominent cyclability with 80.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 10C, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications. Impressively, the full cell devices with [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 and commercial hard carbon as cathode and anode, respectively, can deliver a high energy density of 217.9&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 and excellent cycle life over 1000 cycles.

Assisted by an silicon&#8208;on&#8208;isolator&#8208;based metasurface that can be mass&#8208;manufactured by the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) process, an ultracompact prototype for full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communications is demonstrated, which shows beam&#8208;steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, and three operating modes for flexible signal switching.








Abstract
Beam&#8208;steering devices, which are at the heart of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication links, play an important role in data allocation and exchange. An ideal beam&#8208;steering device features large steering angles, arbitrary channel numbers, reconfigurability, and ultracompactness. However, these criteria have been achieved only partially with conventional beam&#8208;steering devices based on waveguides, micro&#8208;electricalmechanical systems, spatial light modulators, and gratings, which will substantially limit the application of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication techniques. In this study, an ultracompact full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communication system is designed and experimentally demonstrated, which exhibits beam steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, three operating modes for flexible signal switching, and metadevice dimensions as small as 2&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;mm. In particular, the beam&#8208;steering metadevices are mass&#8208;manufactured by a complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) processing platform, which shows their potential for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. The demonstrated metabroadcasting communication system merges optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications and metasurfaces, which reduces the complexity of beam&#8208;steering devices while significantly increasing their performance, opening up a new avenue for high&#8208;quality optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications.

         <title>Homologous Bromides Treatment for Improving the Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite surface treatment by homologous bromide salts is investigated. It is found that bromides not only passivate surface defects but also penetrate into the perovskite providing bulk passivation. This leads to a large voltage&#160;of 1.24 V&#160;in a 1.63&#160;eV bandgap device and an efficiency of 23.7%&#160;in a 1.56&#160;eV bandgap device.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells has achieved rapid improvement. However, it is imperative to minimize the voltage deficit (Woc&#160;= Eg/q&#160;&#8722; Voc) for their PCE to approach the theoretical limit. Herein, the strategy of depositing homologous bromide salts on the perovskite surface to achieve a surface and bulk passivation for the fabrication of solar cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage is reported. Distinct from the conclusions given by previous works, that homologous bromides such as FABr only react with PbI2 to form a large&#8208;bandgap perovskite layer on top of the original perovskite, this work shows that the bromide also penetrates the perovskite film and passivates the perovskite in the bulk. This is confirmed by the small&#8208;bandgap enlargement observed by absorbance and photoluminescence, and the bromide element ratio increasing in the bulk by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry and depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, a clear suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination is confirmed by a variety of characterization methods. This work provides a simple and universal way to reduce the Woc of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells and it will also shed light on developing other high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including perovskite&#8208;based tandems and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Sequential Activation of Molecular and Macroscopic Spin&#8208;State Switching within the Hysteretic Region Following Pulsed Light Excitation (Adv. Mater. 6/2022)</title>

Spin&#8208;State Switching
In article number 2105468, Karl Ridier, G&#225;bor Moln&#225;r,  Azzedine Bousseksou, and co&#8208;workers dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spin transition in crystals of  [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], using pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy. On the sub&#8208;millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser pulse involves a homogeneous and gradual molecular conversion process, as if there were no hysteresis loop, whereas the macroscopic switching is delayed to the millisecond timescale. These results provide guidance for achieving efficient photocontrol of bistable materials.

Tunable Metamaterials
In article number 2109032, Stephan W. Anderson, Xin Zhang, and co&#8208;workers exploit auxetic structures with a negative Poisson's ratio, exhibiting counterintuitive behaviors, to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies. Optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the proposed tunable metamaterials serve to enhance local magnetic fields and increase the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in magnetic resonance image around 4.5 times.

Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons
Launching, controlling, and focusing of in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in van der Waals &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas are realized by Huanjun Chen, Shaozhi Deng, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104164. By engineering the curvature of the antenna extremity, it is possible to tune the focal lengths and lateral sizes of the focal points. This study can open up new avenues for planar nanophotonic devices in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

2D Janus Monolayers
In article number 2106222, Mete Atature, Sefaattin Tongay, and co&#8208;workers use an in situ deterministic plasma technique to enable the synthesis of high&#8208;quality excitonic grade 2D SWSe, SMoSe, and other 2D Janus layers. Integrated spectrometers allow for the collection of structural, optical, and phononic properties during the growth. Through time&#8208;resolved studies, the team offers the first insights into the growth process and minute control provides the first with excitonic grade Janus layers.

Orientation&#8208;Dependent Color
In article number 2104874, Ahmad Rafsanjani, Andr&#233; R. Studart, and co&#8208;workers report soft architectured composites that display striking orientation&#8208;dependent color changes when stretched. The color change results from the rotation of pre&#8208;aligned reflective coated platelets embedded in a soft polymer matrix in a well&#8208;defined architecture. A soft robotic actuator that turns from fully opaque to reflective green upon inflation is illustrated.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Based Structures as an Opportunity to Engineer Optical Functions in Next&#8208;Generation Light Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a critical assessment of lignocellulosics for engineering optically functional materials for smart devices. It discusses the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing on targeted optical properties, such as transparency, haze, luminescence, UV&#8208;absorption, and structural colors. The scope covers the main plant&#8208;based structural materials, as well as non&#8208;lignocellulosic additives bearing an optical function.








Abstract
This review addresses the reconstruction of structural plant components (cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses) into materials displaying advanced optical properties. The strategies to isolate the main building blocks are discussed, and the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing are presented considering their role in engineering optical performance. Then, key elements that enable lignocellulosic to be translated into materials that present optical functionality, such as transparency, haze, reflectance, UV&#8208;blocking, luminescence, and structural colors, are described. Mapping the optical landscape that is accessible from lignocellulosics is shown as an essential step toward their utilization in smart devices. Advanced materials built from sustainable resources, including those obtained from industrial or agricultural side streams, demonstrate enormous promise in optoelectronics due to their potentially lower cost, while meeting or even exceeding current demands in performance. The requirements are summarized for the production and application of plant&#8208;based optically functional materials in different smart material applications and the review is concluded with a perspective about this active field of knowledge.

         <title>Polyprodrug Nanomedicines: An Emerging Paradigm for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyprodrug nanomedicines have great potential in cancer therapy owing to their well&#8208;controlled composition and high drug loading by direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers. Recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized to provide deep insights into the design and preparation of polyprodrug nanomedicines for efficient cancer therapy.








Abstract
Nanomedicines have the potential to provide advanced therapeutic strategies in combating tumors. Polymer&#8208;prodrug&#8208;based nanomedicines are particularly attractive in cancer therapies owing to the maximum drug loading, prolonged blood circulation, and reduced premature leakage and side effects in comparison with conventional nanomaterials. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and drug loading of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates leads to batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations of the prodrugs, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Polyprodrug nanomedicines inherit the numerous intrinsic advantages of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates and exhibit well&#8208;controlled composition and drug loading via direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers, representing a promising nanomedicine for clinical tumor therapies. In this review, recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized for tumor elimination. Various types of polyprodrug nanomedicines and the corresponding properties are first summarized. The unique advantages of polyprodrug nanomedicines and their key roles in various tumor therapies are further highlighted. Finally, current challenges and the perspectives on future research of polyprodrug nanomedicines are discussed.

Abstract
Smart attachable systems have attracted much attention owing to their capabilities in terms of body performance evaluation, disease diagnostics, and drug delivery. Recent advances in chemical and engineering techniques provide many opportunities to improve device fabrication and applications owing to the advantages of being lightweight and easy to control as well as their battery absence and functional diversity. This review highlights the latest developments in the field of chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems, which are mainly inspired by the natural world. Their applications for real&#8208;time monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care sampling, biomarker detection, and controlled release are discussed thoroughly with respect to specific products/prototypes. The perspectives of the field, including persistence guarantee, burden reduction, and personality improvement, are also discussed. It is believed that chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have good potential in both clinical and industrial fields, indicating a large potential to improve human lives in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;Smart attachable systems have attracted much attention owing to their capabilities in terms of body performance evaluation, disease diagnostics, and drug delivery. Recent advances in chemical and engineering techniques provide many opportunities to improve device fabrication and applications owing to the advantages of being lightweight and easy to control as well as their battery absence and functional diversity. This review highlights the latest developments in the field of chemical engineering-based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems, which are mainly inspired by the natural world. Their applications for real-time monitoring, point-of-care sampling, biomarker detection, and controlled release are discussed thoroughly with respect to specific products/prototypes. The perspectives of the field, including persistence guarantee, burden reduction, and personality improvement, are also discussed. It is believed that chemical engineering-based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have good potential in both clinical and industrial fields, indicating a large potential to improve human lives in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Separation, Sensing, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles as an emerging class of building blocks are used for porous organic polymers owing to their easy functionalization, unique host&#8211;guest properties, modifiable conformations, and tunable chemistry. Facilitated by these features, macrocycle&#8208;based porous organic polymers have attracted considerable attentions in the construction of advanced porous materials and excelled in adsorptive separation, optical sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
With the rapid development of materials science, porous organic polymers (POPs) have received remarkable attentions because of their unique properties such as the exceptionally high surface area and flexible molecular design. The ability to incorporate specific functions in a precise manner makes POPs promising platforms for a myriad of applications in molecular adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Therefore, many different types of POPs have been rationally designed and synthesized to expand the scope of advanced materials, endowing them with distinct structures and properties. Recently, supramolecular macrocycles with excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities are emerging as powerful crosslinkers for developing novel POPs with hierarchical structures and improved performance, which can be well&#8208;organized at different spatial scales. Macrocycle&#8208;based POPs could have unusual porous, adsorptive, and optical properties when compared to their nonmacrocycle&#8208;incorporated counterparts. This cooperation provides valuable insights for the molecular&#8208;level understanding of skeletal complexity and diversity. Here, the research advances of macrocycle&#8208;based POPs are aptly summarized by showing their syntheses, properties, and applications in terms of separation, sensing, and catalysis. Finally, the current challenging issues in this exciting research field are delineated and a comprehensive outlook is offered for their future directions.

         <title>Unblocked Electron Channels Enable Efficient Contact Prelithiation for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The contact prelithiation has been strongly considered for compensating the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, exhibiting great potential in ultra&#8208;long cycle life of working batteries and the application of large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the utilization of the sacrificial Li source for contact prelithiation is low (&lt; 65%). Herein we describe the fundamental mechanism of contact prelithiation from the perspective of the Li source/anode interfaces by regulating the initial contact state, and successfully deliver a clear illustration of the pathogeny for capacity attenuation. Specifically, creating plentiful electron channels is an access to making contact prelithiation with a higher Li utilization, as the mitigated local current density that reduces the etching of Li dissolution and SEI extension on electron channels. A vacuum thermal evaporation for depositing the Li film enables the contact interface to possess an adequate electron channel construction, rending a 91.0% of Li utilization and the dead Li yield is significantly reduced in a working battery.

         <title>A Flexible Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Micro&#8208;battery with Unprecedented Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently, reported aqueous micro&#8208;batteries (MBs) only show unsatisfactory electrochemical performance (&#8804;120 mWh cm&#8211;3 volumetric energy density and &lt;1000&#160;&#956;Wh cm&#8211;2 areal energy density) and it remains challenging to develop durable aqueous MBs that can simultaneously offer both high volumetric and areal energy density. Herein, we have adopted an in&#8208;situ electrodeposition strategy to construct a flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine micro&#8208;battery (ZIDMB) for the first time. Notably, the fabrication process well avoids the use of common additives (such as binders, conductive agents, and toxic solvent) and also bypasses subsequent time&#8208;consuming procedures such as grinding, coating, drying etc., thus greatly simplifying the manufacture of the ZIDMB. Meanwhile, owing to the suppression on the shuttle effect of triiodide ions and the high ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte, the ZIDMB can simultaneously deliver record&#8208;high volumetric and areal energy densities of 1647.3 mWh cm&#8211;3 and 2339.1 &#956;Wh cm&#8211;2, thus achieving values at least 13.5&#8208;folds and 2.3&#8208;folds better than those of best available aqueous MBs, respectively. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.

Abstract
Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) &#8211; which entails use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing &#8211; and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. In this review, we consider how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. We identify the materials challenges for specific types of qubits, and we identify how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges. Challenges for and progress towards nanomaterials&#8208;based quantum devices are identified. We aim to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next&#8208;generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

         <title>A Biocompatible Vibration&#8208;Actuated Omni&#8208;Droplets Rectifier with Large Volume Range Fabricated by Femtosecond Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vibration&#8208;actuated omni&#8208;droplets rectifier composed of an array of slippery ratchets is developed for manipulation of droplets with a large volume range in a compatible manner, which can achieve a fast, real&#8208;time, and robust transport of droplets in various modes, including transport of liquid slugs in tubes, programmable and sequential transport, and bidirectional transport, which demonstrates the great potential in biomedical detection and analysis.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance droplet transport is crucial for diverse applications including biomedical detection, chemical micro&#8208;reaction, and droplet microfluidics. Despite extensive progress, traditional passive and active strategies are restricted to limited liquid types, small droplet volume ranges, and poor biocompatibilities. Moreover, more challenges occur for biological fluids due to large viscosity and low surface tension. Here, a vibration&#8208;actuated omni&#8208;droplets rectifier (VAODR) consisting of slippery ratchet arrays fabricated by femtosecond laser and vibration platforms is reported. Through the relative competition between the asymmetric adhesive resistance originating from the lubricant meniscus on the VAODR and the periodic inertial driving force originating from isotropic vibration, the fast (up to &#8776;60&#160;mm s&#8722;1), programmable, and robust transport of droplets is achieved for a large volume range (0.05&#8211;2000&#160;&#181;L, Vmax/Vmin&#160;&#8776; 40&#8239;000) and in various transport modes including transport of liquid slugs in tubes, programmable and sequential transport, and bidirectional transport. This VAODR is general to a high diversity of biological and medical fluids, and thus can be used for biomedical detection including ABO blood&#8208;group tests and anticancer drugs screening. These strategies provide a complementary and promising platform for maneuvering omni&#8208;droplets that are fundamental to biomedical applications and other high&#8208;throughput omni&#8208;droplet operation fields.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation of Hydrogel Actuators by Autocatalytic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators made of polyacrylamide bilayer hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks are controlled by an autocatalytic front of thiols. This regulation enables an autonomous sequential actuation, gradual unrolling, and screwing. In addition, these actuators can activate each other in a relay fashion or switch an electrical circuit.








Abstract
Regulating hydrogel actuators with chemical reaction networks is instrumental for constructing life&#8208;inspired smart materials. Herein, hydrogel actuators are engineered that are regulated by the autocatalytic front of thiols. The actuators consist of two layers. The first layer, which is regular polyacrylamide hydrogel, is in a strained conformation. The second layer, which is polyacrylamide hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks, maintains strain in the first layer. When thiols released by the autocatalytic front reduce disulfide crosslinks, the hydrogel actuates by releasing the mechanical strain in the first layer. The autocatalytic front is sustained by the reaction network, which uses thiouronium salts, disulfides of &#946;&#8208;aminothiols, and maleimide as starting components. The gradual actuation by the autocatalytic front enables movements such as gradual unrolling, screwing, and sequential closing of &#8220;fingers.&#8221; This actuation also allows the transmission of chemical signals in a relay fashion and the conversion of a chemical signal to an electrical signal. Locations and times of spontaneous initiation of autocatalytic fronts can be preprogrammed in the spatial distribution of the reactants in the hydrogel. To approach the functionality of living matter, the actuators triggered by an autocatalytic front can be integrated into smart materials regulated by chemical circuits.

         <title>Stepwise Energy Transfer: Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence from Doped Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic near infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence systems with bright and long&#8208;lived emission are highly valuable for applications in communication, imaging and sensors. However, realizing these materials (especially lifetime over 0.1 s) is a challenge, mainly because of non&#8208;radiative quenching of their long&#8208;lived excitons. Herein, a universal strategy of stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for bright NIR system with remarkable persistent luminescence (up to 0.2 s at 810&#160;nm) is presented, based on a new triphenylene dye doped polymer (TP@PVA) with persistent blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s. This persistent NIR luminescence is demonstrated for application of not only NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting but also NIR bioimaging of penetrating a piece of skin as thick as 2.0&#160;mm. By co&#8208;doping a red dye (such as Nile red) and a NIR dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) into this doped PVA film, the shortage of spectral overlap between TP emission and Cy7 absorbance is successfully solved, through a stepwise FRET process involving of triplet to singlet (TS)&#8208;FRET from TP to the intermediate red dye and then singlet to singlet (SS)&#8208;FRET to Cy7. It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS&#8208;FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS&#8208;FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.

         <title>Harnessing Plasma&#8208;Assisted Doping Engineering to Stabilize Metallic Phase MoSe2 for Fast and Durable Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metallic phase MoSe2 (1T&#8208;MoSe2) has aroused as a rising star for sodium storage in comparison with its semiconductor phase (2H&#8208;MoSe2) owing to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity and unimpeded Na+ diffusion structure. However, the thermodynamically unstable nature of 1T phase renders it an unprecedented challenge to realize its phase control and stabilization. Herein, for the first time, a plasma&#8208;assisted P doping triggered phase transition engineering is proposed to synthesis stabilized P&#8208;doped 1T&#8208;MoSe2 nanoflowers composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs). Mechanism analysis reveals significantly decreased phase transition energy barriers of the plasma&#8208;induced Se vacancy&#8208;rich MoSe2 from 2H to 1T owing to its low crystallinity and reduced structure stability. The vacancy&#8208;rich structure arouses high concentrate P doping, which manipulates the electronic structure of MoSe2 and urges its phase transition, acquiring a high transition efficiency of 91% accompanied with ultra&#8208;high phase stability. As a result, the P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs delivers an exceptional high reversible capacity of 510.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with no capacity fading over 1000 cycles at 5000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for sodium storage. The underlying mechanism of this phase transition engineering verified by profound analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>Folding and Fracture of Single Crystal Graphene Grown on a Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A single crystal graphene film grown on a Cu(111) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has ribbon&#8208;like fold structures. These graphene folds are highly&#8208;oriented and essentially parallel to each other. Cu surface steps underneath graphene are along the &lt;110&gt;&#160;and &lt;211&gt;&#160;directions, leading to the formation of the arrays of folds. The folds in the single layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into &#8220;alternating&#8221; patterns. A &#8220;joint&#8221; (an AB&#8208;stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few&#8208;layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD&#8208;grown single crystal SLG film was simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD&#8208;grown single crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.

The fracture strength of a CVD-grown single crystal SLG film was simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD-grown single crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>3D Hierarchical Host with Enhanced Sodiophilicity Enabling Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been considered as a compliment to lithium metal batteries for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium (Na). Herein, a 3D nanostructured porous carbon particle containing carbon shell&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (PC&#8208;CFe) is employed as a highly reversible Na metal host. PC&#8208;CFe has a unique 3D hierarchy based on submicron&#8208;sized carbon particles, ordered open channels within the carbon particles, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles on the surface. PC&#8208;CFe achieves high reversibility of Na plating/stripping processes over 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8211;2 in Na//Cu asymmetric cells, as well as over 14400 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in Na//Na symmetric cells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior cycling performance of PC&#8208;CFe stems from the stronger adsorption of Na on the surface of the carbon&#8208;coated Fe NPs, which can provide initial nucleation sites more favorable to Na deposition. Moreover, the full cell with a PC&#8208;CFe host without Na metal and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) maintains a high capacity of 103 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 even after 100 cycles, demonstrating the operation of anode&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Engineering macrophage exosome disguised biodegradable nanoplatform for enhanced sonodynamic therapy of glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) exhibits high tissue penetration and negligible radiation damage to normal tissues, and thus emerges as a promising cancer therapeutic modality for glioblastoma (GBM). However, the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and hypoxic microenvironment greatly limit the SDT efficiency. In this work, a biodegradable nanoplatform (termed as CSI) was fabricated by encapsulating catalase (CAT) into silica nanoparticles (CAT@SiO2) for tumor hypoxia relief, and then loaded with the sonosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG). Inspired by the ability of macrophages to cross the BBB, CSI was further coated with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified macrophage exosomes to form CSI@Ex&#8208;A, which possessed efficient BBB penetration and good cancer cell&#8208;targeting capability. After tumor cell endocytosis, highly expressed glutathione (GSH) triggeres biodegradation of the nanoplatform and the released CAT catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. The GSH depletion and O2 self&#8208;supplying effectively enhanced the SDT efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the resulting CSI@Ex&#8208;A exhibited good biocompatibility and long circulation time. These findings demonstrate that CSI@Ex&#8208;A may serve as a competent nanoplatform for GBM therapy, with potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Photosensitizer Nanodot Eliciting Immunogenicity for Photo&#8208;Immunologic Therapy of Postoperative Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infection and Secondary Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By eliciting infection&#8208;related immunogenicity to achieve a higher level of active immunologic responses during acute phase infection and long&#8208;term immunosurveillance, AgB nanodots under near&#8208;infrared irradiation can demonstrate excellent antibacterial results through photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ions. This strategy could solve the predicament remaining in postoperative methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related infection and prevent recurrence.








Abstract
The treatment of postoperative infection caused by multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has become an intractable clinical challenge owing to its low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence. Apart from imperfect antibacterial therapies, induction of insufficient immunogenicity, required for the successful clearance of a pathogen, may also contribute to the problem. Herein, an ultra&#8208;micro photosensitizer, AgB nanodots, using photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ion sterilization, are utilized to efficiently clear invading MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. AgB nanodots are also found to upregulate host immunogenicity in a murine model and establish immunological memory by promoting the upregulated expression of danger signals that are commonly induced by stress&#8208;related responses, including sudden temperature spikes or excess reactive oxygen production. These stimulations boost the antibacterial effects of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, or even memory B cells, which is usually defined as infection&#8208;related immunogenic cell death. Hence, the proposed AgB nanodot strategy may offer a novel platform for the effective treatment of postoperative infection while providing a systematic immunotherapeutic strategy to combat persistent infections, thereby markedly reducing the incidence of recurrence following recovery from primary infections.

         <title>Fluorination&#8208;Enhanced Surface Stability of Disordered Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of Mn&#8208;based cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathodes with increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Fx, x&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) is revealed. Associated with the reduced O redox activity, F in the DRX mitigates the formation of an O&#8208;deficient surface upon cycling, therefore leading to increased stability of the DRX cathode.








Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxides are a promising new class of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their capacity fade presents a major challenge. Partial fluorine (F) substitution into the oxygen (O) lattice appears to be an effective strategy for improving the cycling stability, but the underlying atomistic mechanism remains elusive. Here, using a combination of advanced transmission electron microscopy based imaging and spectroscopy techniques, the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of Mn&#8208;based DRX cathodes with an increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Fx, x&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) are probed. The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of the DRX is revealed. It is discovered that, due to the reduced O redox activity while with increasing F concentration, F in the DRX lattice mitigates the formation of an O&#8208;deficient surface layer upon cycling. For low F&#8208;substituted DRX, the O loss near the surface results in the formation of an amorphous cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer and nanoscale voids after extended cycling. Increased F concentration in the DRX lattice minimizes both O loss and the interfacial reactions between DRX and the liquid electrolyte, enhancing the surface stability of DRX. These results provide guidance on the development of next&#8208;generation cathode materials through anion substitution.

These results provide guidance on the development of next-generation cathode materials through anion substitution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Van der Waals Heterostructures for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>

2D van der Waals nanosheets from molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted electrochemical exfoliation are assembled to form building blocks for wafer&#8208;scale electronics. By using graphene, MoS2 and single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube, and oxidized HfS2 as metallic, n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type semiconducting, and insulating building blocks, various devices are realized including field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, p&#8211;n diodes, and complementary logic gates.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) materials have been considered as potential building blocks for use in fundamental elements of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as electrodes, channels, and dielectrics, because of their diverse and remarkable electrical properties. Furthermore, two or more building blocks of different electronic types can be stacked vertically to generate vdW heterostructures with desired electrical behaviors. However, such fundamental approaches cannot directly be applied practically because of issues such as precise alignment/positioning and large&#8208;quantity material production. Here, these limitations are overcome and wafer&#8208;scale vdW heterostructures are demonstrated by exploiting the lateral and vertical assembly of solution&#8208;processed 2D vdW materials. The high exfoliation yield of the molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted approach enables the production of micrometer&#8208;sized nanosheets in large quantities and its lateral assembly in a wafer&#8208;scale via vdW interactions. Subsequently, the laterally assembled vdW thin&#8208;films are vertically assembled to demonstrate various electronic device applications, such as transistors and photodetectors. Furthermore, multidimensional vdW heterostructures are demonstrated by integrating 1D carbon nanotubes as a p&#8208;type semiconductor to fabricate p&#8211;n diodes and complementary logic gates. Finally, electronic devices are fabricated via inkjet printing as a lithography&#8208;free manner based on the stable nanomaterial dispersions.

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based 2D Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulk conductivity of naphthalene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n&#8208;doping with cobaltocene. Following single&#8208;electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping&#8208;mechanism.








Abstract
2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, the controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

Abstract
Breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry by introducing magnetic order and thereby opening a gap in the topological surface state bands is essential for realizing useful topological properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. In this work, a novel topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is created at the interface of a sputtered, c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented, topological insulator/ferromagnet (TI/FM) heterostructure &#8211; Bi2Te3/Ni80Fe20 because of diffusion of Ni in Bi2Te3 (Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3). The AFM property of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interfacial layer was established by observation of spontaneous exchange bias in the magnetic hysteresis loop and compensated moments in the depth profile of magnetization using polarized neutron reflectometry. Analysis of structural and chemical properties of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer was carried out using selected area electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies, in parallel with our first&#8208;principles calculations, indicate a solid&#8208;state chemical reaction that leads to the formation of Ni&#8208;Te bonds and the presence of topological AFM compound NiBi2Te4 in the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interface layer. The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is &#8764;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway towards industrial CMOS&#8208;process&#8208;compatible sputtered&#8208;MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.

Abstract
Accompanied by the development of nanomaterial science, the metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated centers supported by carbonaceous substrates have emerged as promising artificial metalloenzymes (AMEs) to mimic the biocatalytic effects of their natural counterparts. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined AMEs that contain different atomic metal&#8208;N centers but present similar physicochemical and coordination structures remains a substantial challenge. Here, we have synthesized 20 different types of AMEs with similar geometry and well&#8208;defined atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated centers to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectvities, kinetics, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products. We systematically explored their oxidase&#8208;(OXD), peroxidase&#8208;(POD), and halogen peroxidase&#8208;mimetic (HPO) catalytic behaviors. The Fe&#8208;AME shows the highest OXD&#8208; and HPO&#8208;mimetic activities compared to the other AMEs due to its high vmax (0.927&#160;&#956;M s&#8722;1) and low Km (1.070&#160;mM), while the Cu&#8208;AME displays the best POD&#8208;like performance. Furthermore, theoretical calculation reveals that the ROS&#8208;catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of metal centers. Benefiting from its facile adsorption of H2O2 molecule and lower energy barrier to generating &#8226;O2&#8722;, the Fe&#8208;AME displays higher ROS&#8208;catalytic performances than the Mn&#8208;AME. The engineered AMEs show not only remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also provide new guidance toward developing metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated biocatalysts for broad application fields.

         <title>Selenopeptide Nanomedicine Activates Natural Killer Cell for Enhanced Tumor Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy using the nanotechnology has shown great potential for cancer therapy in clinic. However, uncontrolled transportations and synergistic responses remain challenges. Here, we developed a self&#8208;assembled selenopeptide nanoparticle that strengthened the tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy through the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by the oxidative metabolite of the selenopeptide. With advantages of the enzyme&#8208;induced size&#8208;reduction and the reactive oxygen species&#8208;driven deselenization, this selenopeptide was able to deliver the therapeutics, e.g., doxorubicin (DOX) to solid tumors and further activate the NK cells in a programmed manner. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo results proved the mutual promotion between the DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy and the selenopeptide&#8208;induced immunotherapy, which synergistically contributed to the improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. It is anticipated that the selenopeptide may provide a type of promising stimuli&#8208;responsive immune modulator for versatile biomedical applications.

         <title>Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Contact Lens: Recent Advances and Future Opportunities in Diagnostics and Therapeutics</title>

Abstract
The eye is one of the most complex organs in the human body, containing rich and critical physiological information (e.g., intraocular pressure, corneal temperature, and pH) as well as a library of metabolite biomarkers (e.g., glucose, proteins, and specific ions). Smart contact lenses (SCLs) can serve as a wearable intelligent ocular prosthetic device capable of non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of various essential physical/biochemical parameters and drug loading/delivery for the treatment of ocular diseases. Advances in SCL technologies and the growing public interest in personalized health are accelerating SCL research more than ever before. Here, we discussed the current status and potential of SCL development through a comprehensive review from fabrication to applications to commercialization. First, we discuss the material, fabrication, and platform designs of the SCLs for the diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Then, we review the latest advances in diagnostic and therapeutic SCLs for clinical translation. Later, we summarize the established techniques for wearable power transfer and wireless data transmission applied to current SCL devices. We also provide an outlook, future opportunities, and challenges for developing next&#8208;generation SCL devices. With the rise in interest of SCL development, this comprehensive and essential review can serve as a new paradigm for the SCL devices.

         <title>MXene&#8211;Based Metal Anode with Stepped Sodiophilic Gradient Structure Enables a Large Current Density for Rechargeable Na&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium&#8208;metal batteries such as Na&#8208;O2 batteries. Designing 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode, however, the cycling stability at a large current density (&gt; 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8211;2) is still difficult to realize. In this work, we design a series of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h&#8208;Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG), and its thickness can be controlled (ranges from 80 to 250&#160;&#956;m). The sodiophilic of scaffold is adjusted by the content of h&#8208;Ti3C2, which is stepped increased from top (electrolyte membrane side) to bottom. The sodiophilic gradient structure can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom thus inhibits the growth of dendrite. The h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na based symmetrical batteries exhibited a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA&#8226;cm&#8211;2) and a high cut&#8208;off capacity (40 mAh&#8226;cm&#8211;2). Moreover, Na&#8211;O2 battery with h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137&#160;V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA&#8226;g&#8211;1 (is equivalent to 0.14 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2) and 1000 mAh&#8226;g&#8211;1 (0.14 mAh&#183;cm&#8211;2). This deposition&#8211;regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffold for high&#8208;performance sodium metal anode&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>White&#8208;Light Driven Resonant Emission from a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resonant emission in photonic structures is very useful to construct all&#8208;photonic circuits for optical interconnects and quantum computing. Optical generation of most resonant emitting modes in photonic structures has been obtained by coherent pumping rather than incoherent illumination. Particularly, the development of white&#8208;light or even solar&#8208;powered on&#8208;chip light sources remains challenging but is very attractive in view of the much facile availability of these incoherent excitation sources. Here the net resonant emission from monolayer semiconductor has been demonstrated under the simulated solar illumination by a white light&#8208;emitting diode. The device is formed by embedding a two&#8208;dimensional gain medium into a planar microcavity on a silicon wafer, which is compatible with the prevailing on&#8208;chip photonic technology. Coherent and white&#8208;light excitation sources are respectively selected for optical pumping, where the output light in two cases exhibits the well&#8208;consistent resonant wavelength, linewidth, polarization, location, and Gaussian&#8208;beam profile. The fundamental TEM00 mode behaves a doublet emission, resulting from anisotropy&#8208;induced nondegenerate states with orthogonal polarizations. The extraordinary spectral flipping is attributed to the competitive interplay of resonant absorption and emission. This work paves a way towards white&#8208;light or solar&#8208;powered state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photonic applications at the chip scale.

         <title>Hygroscopic chemistry enables fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is an extremely serious safety risk in energy storage devices; which can be avoided by replacing their components with nonflammable materials. However; these devices are still destroyed by the high&#8208;temperature decomposition; lacking reliability. Here; we further demonstrate a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor that recovers after the burn with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. Using fire&#8208;tolerant electrodes and separator with a semi&#8208;open device configuration; hygroscopic CaCl2 in the air (&#8220;CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221;) was designed as a self&#8208;healable electrolyte; which lost its water solvent at high temperatures but spontaneously absorbed water from the air to recover by itself at low temperatures. The supercapacitor was disenabled at 500 &#176;C; while it recovered after cooling in the air. Especially; it even recovered after burning around 647 &#176;C with enhanced performances. Our study offers a self&#8208;healing strategy to design high&#8208;safety; high&#8208;reliability; and fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors; which inspires a promising way to deal with general fire&#8208;related risks.

         <title>Manipulating Exchange Bias in a Van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces are formed for generating a non&#8208;antisymmetric exchange bias, where ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 is coupled to antiferromagnetic CrSe with a noncollinear spin texture and oxidized Fe3GeTe2 with a weak antiferromagnetic order. This exchange bias can be manipulated with field coolings, which opens up new routes toward controlling 2D spintronic devices based on van der Waals magnets.








Abstract
Spintronics applications of thin&#8208;film magnets require control and design of specific magnetic properties. Exchange bias, originating from the pinning of spins in a ferromagnet by these of an antiferromagnet, is a part of the highly important elements for spintronics applications. Here, an exchange bias of &#8776;90 mT in a van der Waals ferromagnet encapsulated by two antiferromagnets at 5 K, the value of which is highly tunable by the field coolings, is reported. The non&#8208;antisymmetric dependence of exchange bias on field cooling is explained through considering an uncompensated interfacial magnetic layer of an antiferromagnet with a noncollinear spin texture, and a weak antiferromagnetic order in the oxidized layer, at two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces. This work opens up new routes toward designing and controlling 2D spintronic devices made of atomically thin van der Waals magnets.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode with Reinforced Electrochemical Performance Enabled by Convertible Amorphous Li2CO3 Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;nickel cathode (Ni&#160;&#8805;&#160;90%) is developed through controlling the surface residual lithium composition with a formed amorphous Li2CO3 protective layer. This cathode can resist corrosion by air, and will be converted into a stable cathode electrolyte interphase during the electrochemical process, resulting in enhanced storage performance and extended cycle life for high&#8208;nickel cathodes.








Abstract
High&#8208;nickel (Ni &#8805; 90%) cathodes with high specific capacity hold great potential for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical application is restricted by the high interfacial reactivity under continuous air erosion and electrolyte assault. Herein, a stable high&#8208;nickel cathode is rationally designed via in situ induction of a dense amorphous Li2CO3 on the particle surface by a preemptive atmosphere control. Among the residual lithium compounds, Li2CO3 is the most thermodynamically stable one, so a dense Li2CO3 coating layer can serve as a physical protection layer to isolate the cathode from contact with moist air. Furthermore, amorphous Li2CO3 can be transformed into a robust F&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) during cycling, which reinforces the cathode's interfacial stability and improves the electrochemical performance. The assembled coin cell with this modified cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 232.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 with a superior initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 95.1%, and considerable capacity retention of 90.4% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, no slurry gelation occurs during the large&#8208;scale electrode fabrication process. This work opens a valuable perspective on the evolution of amorphous Li2CO3 in LIBs and provides guidance on protecting unstable high&#8208;capacity cathodes for energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Emerging Long&#8208;Range Order from a Freeform Disordered Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general framework for emerging long&#8208;range ordered phase distribution in a freeform disordered metasurface is established based on disorder parameter engineering and topology optimization. Within this general framework, the order distribution and the corresponding functionality can be inversely optimized and artificially designed, offering a new freedom to design material functionality.








Abstract
Recently, disordered metasurfaces have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in imaging, holography, and wavefront shaping. However, how to emerge long&#8208;range ordered phase distribution in disordered metasurfaces remains an outstanding problem. Here, a general framework is proposed to generate a spatially homogeneous in&#8208;plane phase distribution from a disordered metasurface, by engineering disorder parameters together with topology optimization. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an all&#8208;dielectric disordered supercell metasurface with relatively homogeneous in&#8208;plane phase fluctuation is designed by disorder parameter engineering, manifesting as polarization conversion&#8208;dependent random scattering or unidirectional transmission. Then, a topology optimization approach is utilized to overcome the lattice coupling effect and to further improve the homogeneity of complex electric field fluctuation. In comparison with the initial supercell metasurface, both the phase fluctuation range and the relative efficiency of the topology&#8208;optimized freeform metasurface are significantly improved, leading to a long&#8208;range ordered electric field distribution. Moreover, three experimental realizations are performed, all of which agree well with the theoretical results. This methodology may inspire more exotic optical phenomena and find more promising applications in disordered metasurfaces and disordered&#160;optics.

         <title>Competitive Coordination&#8208;Oriented Monodispersed Ruthenium Sites in Conductive MOF/LDH Hetero&#8208;Nanotree Catalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF)/layered double hydroxide (LDH) hetero&#8208;nanotree structure coupled with monodisperse Ru sites is constructed via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy. Based on a competitive coordination process, Ru&#63743;N sites are precisely anchored by rich&#8208;amino organic linkers. The chemical and electronic structure of the hetero&#8208;nanotree catalysts are well modified and lead to a superior overall water&#8208;splitting performance in alkaline media.








Abstract
Rational exploration of efficient, inexpensive, and robust electrocatalysts is critical for the efficient water splitting. Conjugated conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) with multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to construct bifunctional heterostructure catalysts are considered as an efficient but complicated strategy. Here, the fabrication of a cMOF/LDH hetero&#8208;nanotree array catalyst (CoNiRu&#8208;NT) coupled with monodispersed ruthenium (Ru) sites via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy is reported. Rich&#8208;amino hexaiminotriphenylene linkers coordinate with the LDH nanotrunk to form cMOF nanobranches, providing numerous anchoring sites to precisely confine and stabilize Ru&#63743;N4 sites. Moreover, monodispersed and reduced Ru moieties facilitate H2O adsorption and dissociation, and the heterointerface between the cMOF and the LDH further modifies the chemical and electronic structures. Optimized CoNiRu&#8208;NT displays a significant increase in electrochemical water&#8208;splitting properties in alkaline media, affording low overpotentials of 22&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 255&#160;mV at 20 mA cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. In an actual electrochemical system, CoNiRu&#8208;NT drives an overall water splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.47&#160;V to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This performance is comparable to that of pure noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials and superior to most reported MOF&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Neisseria meningitidis Opca Protein/MnO2 Hybrid Nanoparticles for Overcoming the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier to Treat Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By loading the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate in hollow manganese dioxide nanoparticles with surface modification of Opca protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a bionic nanotherapeutic system is constructed to effectively overcome the blood&#8211;brain barrier for improved glioblastoma therapy.








Abstract
The major hurdle in glioblastoma therapy is the low efficacy of drugs crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Neisseria meningitidis is known to specifically enrich in the central nervous system through the guidance of an outer membrane invasion protein named Opca. Here, by loading a chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) in hollow manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles with surface modification of the Opca protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a bionic nanotherapeutic system (MTX@MnO2&#8208;Opca) is demonstrated to effectively overcome the BBB. The presence of the Opca protein enables the drug to cross the BBB and penetrate into tumor tissues. After accumulating in glioblastoma, the nanotherapeutic system catalyzes the decomposition of excess H2O2 in the tumor tissue and thereby generates O2, which alleviates tumor hypoxia and enhances the effect of chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. This bionic nanotherapeutic system may exhibit great potential in the treatment of glioblastoma.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major hurdle in glioblastoma therapy is the low efficacy of drugs crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; is known to specifically enrich in the central nervous system through the guidance of an outer membrane invasion protein named Opca. Here, by loading a chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) in hollow manganese dioxide (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles with surface modification of the Opca protein of &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt;, a bionic nanotherapeutic system (MTX@MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Opca) is demonstrated to effectively overcome the BBB. The presence of the Opca protein enables the drug to cross the BBB and penetrate into tumor tissues. After accumulating in glioblastoma, the nanotherapeutic system catalyzes the decomposition of excess H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the tumor tissue and thereby generates O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which alleviates tumor hypoxia and enhances the effect of chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. This bionic nanotherapeutic system may exhibit great potential in the treatment of glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reshaping the Tumor Immune Microenvironment Based on a Light&#8208;Activated Nanoplatform for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#160;self&#8208;supplying&#160;nanoplatform&#160;for&#160;enhancing PDT/RT and reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment exhibits effective inhibition of the growth of both primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. Light activation of hole generation can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to produce oxygen for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy, but also promotes the TAMs&#8217; polarization to M1 phenotype, and decreases the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;.








Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) always causes poor antitumor immune efficacy, prone to relapse and metastasis. Herein, novel poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) modified BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 (BFO/BWO) with a p&#8211;n type heterojunction is constructed for reshaping the immunosuppressive TME. Reactive oxygen species can be generated under light activation by the well&#8208;separated hole (h+)&#8211;electron (e&#8722;) pairs owing to the heterojunction in BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs. Interestingly, h+ can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to generate O2 for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiotherapy (RT), but also promotes tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, which is beneficial to decrease the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Importantly, such a light&#8208;activated nanoplatform, combining with RT can efficiently activate and recruit cytotoxic T lymphocytes to infiltrate in tumor tissues, as well as stimulate TAMs to M1 phenotype, dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive TME into an immunoactive one, and further boost immune memory responses. Moreover, BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs also present high performance for computed tomography imaging contrast. Taken together, this work offers a novel paradigm for achieving O2 self&#8208;supply of inorganic nanoagents and reshaping of the tumor immune microenvironment for effective inhibition of cancer as well as metastasis and recurrence.

         <title>Resolving the Spatial Variation and Correlation of Hyperfine Spin Properties in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hyperfine interaction is an important spin quantum property in organic semiconductors. Exploiting the electroluminescence response of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to magnetic fields, large intra&#8208;device variations of this property exceeding &#8776;30% are resolved which are spatially correlated over characteristic lengths of 7 &#181;m. This has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic devices which rely on spin for their functionality.








Abstract
Devices that exploit the quantum properties of materials are widespread, with quantum information processors and quantum sensors showing significant progress. Organic materials offer interesting opportunities for quantum technologies owing to their engineerable spin properties, with spintronic operation and spin resonance magnetic&#8208;field sensing demonstrated in research grade devices, as well as proven compatibility with large&#8208;scale fabrication techniques. Yet several important challenges remain as moving toward scaling these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle quantum devices to larger integrated logic systems or spatially smaller sensing elements, particularly those associated with the variation of quantum properties both within and between devices. Here, spatially resolved magnetoluminescence is used to provide the first 2D map of a hyperfine spin property&#8212;the Overhauser field&#8212;in traditional organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Intra&#8208;device variabilities are found to exceed &#8776;30% while spatially correlated behavior is exhibited on lengths beyond 7&#160;&#181;m, similar in size to pixels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active&#8208;matrix OLED arrays, which has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic quantum devices.

         <title>Advanced Materials for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vaccines have been a major focus of the global SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 response. Advanced materials have played a role in enabling the current generation of effective vaccines that have been deployed, and also they have shown promise in next&#8208;generation vaccines that are being developed in response to the pandemic.








Abstract
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), has killed untold millions worldwide and has hurtled vaccines into the spotlight as a go&#8208;to approach to mitigate it. Advances in virology, genomics, structural biology, and vaccine technologies have enabled a rapid and unprecedented rollout of COVID&#8208;19 vaccines, although much of the developing world remains unvaccinated. Several new vaccine platforms have been developed or deployed against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, with most targeting the large viral Spike immunogen. Those that safely induce strong and durable antibody responses at low dosages are advantageous, as well are those that can be rapidly produced at a large scale. Virtually all COVID&#8208;19 vaccines and adjuvants possess nanoscale or microscale dimensions and represent diverse and unique biomaterials. Viral vector vaccine platforms, lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and multimeric display technologies for subunit vaccines have received much attention. Nanoscale vaccine adjuvants have also been used in combination with other vaccines. To deal with the ongoing pandemic, and to be ready for potential future ones, advanced vaccine technologies will continue to be developed in the near future. Herein, the recent use of advanced materials used for developing COVID&#8208;19 vaccines is summarized.

         <title>Next Evolution in organ&#8208;scale Biofabrication: Bioresin Design for Rapid high&#8208;resolution Vat Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of bioprinting has made significant advancements in recent years and allowed for the precise deposition of biomaterials and cells. However, within this field lies a major challenge, which is developing high resolution constructs, with complex architectures. In an effort to overcome these challenges a biofabrication technique known as vat polymerisation is being increasingly investigated due to its high fabrication accuracy and control of resolution (&#956;m scale). Despite the progress made in developing hydrogel precursors for bioprinting techniques, such as extrusion based bioprinting, there is a major lack in developing hydrogel precursor bioresins for vat polymerisation. This is due to the specific unique properties and characteristics required for vat polymerisation, from lithography to the latest volumetric printing. This is of major concern as the shortage of bioresins available has a significant impact on progressing this technology and exploring its full potential, including speed, resolution and scale. Therefore, this review discusses the key requirements that need to be addressed in successfully developing a bioresin. The influence of monomer architecture and bioresin composition on printability is described, along with key fundamental parameters that can be altered to increase printing accuracy. Finally, recent advancements in bioresins are discussed together with future directions.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling, Robust and Adhesive Extracellular Matrix&#8208;Mimicking Hydrogel Used as Intraoral Dressing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the wet and dynamic environment of the oral cavity, the healing of intraoral wounds, such as tooth extraction wounds, requires stable and firm wound dressings. In clinical practice, cotton balls and gauze, sponge plugs, or sutures are used to treat extraction wounds, but none of these means can continuously isolate the wound from the intraoral environment and provide ideal healing conditions. Herein, inspired by the natural extracellular matrix, a family of wound dressings was developed for intraoral wound repair. Infiltrating a ductile long&#8208;chain hydrogel network into a prefabricated, sturdy macromolecular meshwork and in situ crosslinking endowed the composite hydrogel with controllable swelling behaviors and robust mechanical properties. The macromolecular meshwork functioned as the backbone to support the composite and restricts the swelling of the long&#8208;chain hydrogel network. In vitro tests verified that this dressing could provide durable protection for intraoral wounds against complex irritations. Furthermore, accelerated wound healing occurred when the dressing was applied in vivo on a canine tooth extraction model due to the effective reduction of acute inflammation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the wet and dynamic environment of the oral cavity, the healing of intraoral wounds, such as tooth extraction wounds, requires stable and firm wound dressings. In clinical practice, cotton balls and gauze, sponge plugs, or sutures are used to treat extraction wounds, but none of these means can continuously isolate the wound from the intraoral environment and provide ideal healing conditions. Herein, inspired by the natural extracellular matrix, a family of wound dressings was developed for intraoral wound repair. Infiltrating a ductile long-chain hydrogel network into a prefabricated, sturdy macromolecular meshwork and in situ crosslinking endowed the composite hydrogel with controllable swelling behaviors and robust mechanical properties. The macromolecular meshwork functioned as the backbone to support the composite and restricts the swelling of the long-chain hydrogel network. In vitro tests verified that this dressing could provide durable protection for intraoral wounds against complex irritations. Furthermore, accelerated wound healing occurred when the dressing was applied in vivo on a canine tooth extraction model due to the effective reduction of acute inflammation. These results suggest the bioinspired hydrogel has great potential for application as an intraoral dressing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoresponsive Vaccine&#8208;Like CAR&#8208;M System with High&#8208;Efficiency Central Immune Regulation for Inflammation&#8208;Related Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed concept of the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM system makes a breakthrough in the treatment of inflammation&#8208;related depression. By precisely regulating inflammation in the central nervous system, this drug delivery system can exert a light&#8208;response immune regulation effect, inhibit the polarization of M1 type microglia, and produce a vaccine&#8208;like effect to prevent inflammation&#8208;related depression.








Abstract
Increasing evidence suggests that activation of microglia&#8208;induced neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of depression. Consequently, targeting the central nervous system to reduce neuroinflammation holds great promise for the treatment of depression. However, few drugs can enter the brain via a circulatory route through the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) to reach the central nervous system efficiently, which limits the pharmacological treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein, a light&#8208;responsive system named UZPM, consisting of blue&#8208;emitting NaYF4:Yb, Tm@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (UCNP@ZIF&#8208;8), photoacid (PA), and melatonin (MT) is developed to address the above issues. Meanwhile, UZPM is introduced into macrophages by functional liposomes fusion and modified with hydroxylamine groups on the cell surface. Aldehyde&#8208;modified cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein&#8208;4 (CTLA&#8208;4) is used as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting group to modify the surface of macrophages by aldehyde/hydroxylamine condensation to precisely target central M1&#8208;type microglia (CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM drug delivery system can efficiently penetrate the BBB, targeting centrally activated microglia, and thus, inhibiting the M1&#8208;type polarization of microglia, producing continuous vaccine&#8208;like anti&#8208;inflammatory effects that prevent the occurrence and development of inflammation&#8208;related depression.

         <title>A Facile, Protein&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Theranostic Strategy for Multimodal&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic and Photothermal Immunotherapy In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature's ability to achieve molecular self&#8208;assembly, a facile, protein&#8208;derived supramolecular theranostic strategy for multimodal&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy in vivo is demonstrated.








Abstract
Theranostic systems that permit both diagnosis and treatment in vivo are highly appealing means by which to meet the demands of precision medicine. However, most such systems remain subject to issues related to complex molecular design and synthesis, potential toxicity, and possible photoactivity changes. Herein, a novel supramolecular theranostic strategy involving biomarker protein activation (BPA) and a host&#8211;guest strategy is proposed. To exemplify BPA, a facile &#8220;one&#8208;for&#8208;all&#8221; nanotheranostic agent for both albumin detection and cancer treatment is demonstrated, which utilizes a nanoparticulate heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY dye derivative (B4&#160;NPs). The fluorescence and photoactivity of BODIPY dyes are completely suppressed by aggregation&#8208;induced self&#8208;quenching in the nanoparticulate state. However, a Balb/c nude mouse model is used to confirm that following the disassembly of injected B4&#160;NPs, BODIPY specifically binds albumin in vivo, accompanied by significantly enhanced biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency. More importantly, this supramolecular host&#8211;guest BPA strategy enables the resultant nanoplatform to act as a facile and efficient strategy for photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Programmable Matter: The Nanoparticle Atom and DNA Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable atom equivalents (PAEs) are nanoparticles functionalized with a dense shell of DNA containing short single&#8208;stranded regions called &#8220;sticky ends.&#8221; When PAEs with complementary sticky ends interact, hybridization leads to DNA &#8220;bonds&#8221; between nanoparticles. PAEs can be assembled into crystalline arrangements where unlike atomic systems, the &#8220;atom&#8221; (nanoparticle) and &#8220;bond&#8221; (DNA) can be tuned independently to yield designer materials.








Abstract
Colloidal crystal engineering with DNA has led to significant advances in bottom&#8208;up materials synthesis and a new way of thinking about fundamental concepts in chemistry. Here, programmable atom equivalents (PAEs), comprised of nanoparticles (the &#8220;atoms&#8221;) functionalized with DNA (the &#8220;bonding elements&#8221;), are assembled through DNA hybridization into crystalline lattices. Unlike atomic systems, the &#8220;atom&#8221; (e.g., the nanoparticle shape, size, and composition) and the &#8220;bond&#8221; (e.g., the DNA length and sequence) can be tuned independently, yielding designer materials with unique catalytic, optical, and biological properties. In this review, nearly three decades of work that have contributed to the evolution of this class of programmable matter is chronicled, starting from the earliest examples based on gold&#8208;core PAEs, and then delineating how advances in synthetic capabilities, DNA design, and fundamental understanding of PAE&#8208;PAE interactions have led to new classes of functional materials that, in several cases, have no natural equivalent.

         <title>Controlled Activation of TRPV1 Channels on Microglia to Boost Their Autophagy for Clearance of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein and Enhance Therapy of Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugates of ultra&#8208;small Cu2&#8211;xSe nanoparticles and TRPV1 antibody can efficiently target microglia and photothermally activate their TRPV1 channels under the second near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, which promotes the efficient influx of Ca2+ to boost their autophagy. The enhanced autophagy of microglia improves the phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn and boosts the therapeutic efficacy of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized with accumulation of Lewy bodies with a major component of fibrillar alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn). Herein, boosting PD therapeutic efficacy by enhancing the autophagy of microglia to phagocytose and degrade &#945;&#8208;syn via controlled opening of their surface TRPV1 channels with rationally designed photothermal nanoagent is reported. The Cu2&#8722;xSe&#8208;anti&#8208;TRPV1 nanoparticles (CS&#8208;AT NPs) are fabricated to target the microglia and open their surface TRPV1 channels under the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) laser irradiation to cause influx of Ca2+ to activate ATG5 and Ca2+/CaMKK2/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, which promote phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn. The CS&#8208;AT NPs are efficiently delivered by focused ultrasound into striatum of PD mice with high expression of TRPV1 receptors. The athletic ability of PD mice treated by CS&#8208;AT NPs and NIR&#8208;II irradiation is significantly improved due to the phagocytotic clearance of &#945;&#8208;syn by microglia with enhanced autophagy. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, ionized calcium binding adapter protein 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and pSer129&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn (p&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn) of treated PD mice are almost recovered to the normal levels of healthy mice. This study provides insights into the activation of microglial autophagy by targeting surface ion channels to improve the treatment of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Preconstructing Asymmetric Interface in Air Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries is proposed. Precise loading of the electrocatalysts at the asymmetric interface is achieved to obtain zinc&#8211;air batteries cycling at 25 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to various electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford great potential toward next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage. Nevertheless, the oxygen redox reactions at the air cathode are highly sluggish in kinetics to induce poor energy efficiency and limited cycling lifespan. Air cathodes with asymmetric configurations significantly promote the electrocatalytic efficiency of the loaded electrocatalysts, whereas rational synthetic methodology to effectively fabricate asymmetric air cathodes remains insufficient. Herein, a strategy of asymmetric interface preconstruction is proposed to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for high&#8208;performance rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, the asymmetric interface is preconstructed by introducing immiscible organic&#8211;water diphases within the air cathode, at which the electrocatalysts are in situ formed to achieve an asymmetric configuration. The as&#8208;fabricated asymmetric air cathodes realize high working rates of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, long cycling stability of 3400 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and over 100 cycles under harsh conditions of 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 25 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to many electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up. This work provides an effective strategy toward advanced asymmetric air cathodes with high electrocatalytic efficiency and significantly promotes the performance of rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Stretchable Mesh Nanoelectronics for 3D Single&#8208;Cell Chronic Electrophysiology from Developing Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building cyborg brain organoids through the integration of stretchable mesh nanoelectronics with human induced pluripotent stem cell derived progenitors and neurons through organogenesis is reported. The stretchable mesh nanoelectronics can adapt the morphogenesis of organoids and record organoid&#8208;wide electrophysiology at single&#8208;cell, millisecond resolution, chronically and noninvasively. Emergence and evolution of single&#8208;unit action potentials over the time course of brain organoid development are measured.








Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived brain organoids have shown great potential for studies of human brain development and neurological disorders. However, quantifying the evolution of the electrical properties of brain organoids during development is currently limited by the measurement techniques, which cannot provide long&#8208;term stable 3D bioelectrical interfaces with developing brain organoids. Here, a cyborg brain organoid platform is reported, in which &#8220;tissue&#8208;like&#8221; stretchable mesh nanoelectronics are designed to match the mechanical properties of brain organoids and to be folded by the organogenetic process of progenitor or stem cells, distributing stretchable electrode arrays across the 3D organoids. The tissue&#8208;wide integrated stretchable electrode arrays show no interruption to brain organoid development, adapt to the volume and morphological changes during brain organoid organogenesis, and provide long&#8208;term stable electrical contacts with neurons within brain organoids during development. The seamless and noninvasive coupling of electrodes to neurons enables long&#8208;term stable, continuous recording and captures the emergence of single&#8208;cell action potentials from early&#8208;stage brain organoid development.

         <title>Creating a Ferromagnetic Ground State with Tc Above Room Temperature in a Paramagnetic Alloy through Non&#8208;Equilibrium Nanostructuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hitherto&#8208;unknown ferromagnetic ground state with Curie temperature above room temperature can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by non&#8208;equilibrium nanostructuring. The ferromagnetic ground state originates from surface stress&#8208;induced tetragonal distortion in the ligaments of the nanoporous network. The study demonstrates a route for reaching conventionally inaccessible magneto&#8208;electronic states and achieving an on/off ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic switching for potential applications.








Abstract
Materials with strong magnetostructural coupling have complex energy landscapes featuring multiple local ground states, thus making it possible to switch among distinct magnetic&#8208;electronic properties. However, these energy minima are rarely accessible by a mere application of an external stimuli to the system in equilibrium state. A ferromagnetic ground state, with Tc above room temperature, can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by nonequilibrium nanostructuring. By a dealloying process, bulk chemically disordered FeRh alloys are transformed into a nanoporous structure with the topology of a few nanometer&#8208;sized ligaments and nodes. Magnetometry and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy reveal the coexistence of two magnetic ground states, a conventional low&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;glass and a hitherto&#8208;unknown robust ferromagnetic phase. The emergence of the ferromagnetic phase is validated by density functional theory calculations showing that local tetragonal distortion induced by surface stress favors ferromagnetic ordering. The study provides a means for reaching conventionally inaccessible magnetic states, resulting in a complete on/off ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic switching over a broad temperature range.

         <title>All&#8208;dielectric metasurface&#8208;enabled multiple vortex emissions</title>

Abstract
On&#8208;chip integrated micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale vortex lasers are key elements for addressing the exponentially growing demand for information capacity. Although tunable vortex micro&#8208;lasers have been reported, each laser pulse still possesses one particular topological charge and requires additional multiplexing. In this study, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of coherent laser arrays with different topological charges by combining metalenses with semiconductor micro&#8208;lasers. A TiO2 vortex metalens converts two orbital angular momentum beams into the same diffraction&#8208;limit spot with opposite circular polarizations through spin&#8208;to&#8208;orbital conversion. Consequently, the micro&#8208;laser emission at the focal spot, which can be decomposed into two circularly polarized beams, is collimated into vortex micro&#8208;laser beams with two different topological charges through a time&#8208;reversal process. This concept is extended to a 2&#215;2 metalens array by introducing off&#8208;axis terms, and eight topological charges are produced simultaneously. This research is a significant step toward the on&#8208;chip integration of micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;lasers.

         <title>Synergistic Energy Absorption Mechanisms of Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here, we report a unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#8208;based architected materials. The architected materials consist of repeating unit cells of bistable tilted LCE beams sandwiched between stiff supports. The viscoelastic behavior of the LCE causes the energy absorption to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship, which can be modulated by changing the degree of mesogen alignment and the loading direction relative to the director. For a strain rate of 600 s&#8211;1, the unit cell exhibits up to a 5&#160;MJ/m3 energy absorption density, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the same structure fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane elastomer and is comparable to the dissipation from irreversible plastic deformation exhibited by denser metals. For a multilayered structure of unit cells, nonuniform buckling of the different layers produces additional viscoelastic dissipation. This synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with the number of layers. The sequence of cell collapse can be controlled by grading the beam thickness to further promote viscous dissipation and enhance the energy absorption density. We envision that our study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.

         <title>Materials Engineering for Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in material and architecture engineering of air&#8208;water&#8208;harvesting materials have promoted remarkable progress toward the atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology. This perspective discusses the fundamental insights of how different material designs affect the water&#8208;material interactions in advancing AWH technology.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is emerging as a promising strategy to produce fresh water from abundant airborne moisture to overcome the global clean water shortage. The ubiquitous moisture resources allow AWH to be free from geographical restrictions and potentially realize decentralized applications, making it a vital parallel or supplementary freshwater production approach to liquid water resource&#8208;based technologies. Recent advances in regulating chemical properties and micro/nanostructures of moisture&#8208;harvesting materials have demonstrated new possibilities to promote enhanced device performance and new understandings. This perspective aims to provide a timely overview on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials design and how they serve as the active components in AWH. First, the key processes of AWH, including vapor condensation, droplet nucleation, growth, and departure are outlined, and the desired material properties based on the fundamental mechanisms are discussed. Then, how tailoring materials&#8208;water interactions at the molecular level play a vital role in realizing high water uptake and low energy consumption is shown. Last, the challenges and outlook on further improving AWH from material designs and system engineering aspects are highlighted.

         <title>3D Microvascularized Tissue Models by Laser&#8208;Based Cavitation Molding of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel method to generate channels in collagen hydrogels with sub&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m resolution using non&#8208;ablative cavitation&#8208;based laser patterning. These channels can be used for the direct seeding of endothelial cells to form an artificial microvasculature. Cavitation&#8208;based patterning preserves the viability of cells in the hydrogels arranged either as single cells or spheroids, enabling complex microvascularized tissue models.








Abstract
3D tissue models recapitulating human physiology are important for fundamental biomedical research, and they hold promise to become a new tool in drug development. An integrated and defined microvasculature in 3D tissue models is necessary for optimal cell functions. However, conventional bioprinting only allows the fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds containing vessel&#8208;like structures with large diameters (&gt;100&#160;&#181;m) and simple geometries. Recent developments in laser photoablation enable the generation of this type of structure with higher resolution and complexity, but the photo&#8208;thermal process can compromise cell viability and hydrogel integrity. To address these limitations, the present work reports in situ 3D patterning of collagen hydrogels by femtosecond laser irradiation to create channels and cavities with diameters ranging from 20 to 60&#160;&#181;m. In this process, laser irradiation of the hydrogel generates cavitation gas bubbles that rearrange the collagen fibers, thereby creating stable microchannels. Such 3D channels can be formed in cell&#8208; and organoid&#8208;laden hydrogel without affecting the viability outside the lumen and can enable the formation of artificial microvasculature by the culture of endothelial cells and cell media perfusion. Thus, this method enables organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and 3D tissue models featuring complex microvasculature.

         <title>Multiple Responsive CPL Switches in an Enantiomeric Pair of Perovskite Confined in Lanthanide MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are embedded in homochiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) without any ligand passivation. Experimental results indicate that MAPbBr3 NCs adopted a chiral packing in enantiomeric MOFs by Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O bonds. The CPL of composites possesses the multiple external&#8208;stimulate responsive reversibility. 








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches have attracted widespread attention due to their potential applications in advanced information technologies. However, the design and fabrication of solid&#8208;state multiple&#8208;responsive CPL switches remain challenging. Here, through self&#8208;assembly of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), a pair of crystalline enantiomeric (P)&#8208;(+)/(M)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;EuMOF&#8835;MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;) adducts is prepared, where the achiral MAPbBr3 perovskite NCs embedded into chiral MOFs inherit the chirality of host MOFs by host&#8208;guest Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O coordination bonds, which is demonstrated by synchrotron&#8208;radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The chiral adducts show enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), good thermal stability of CPL in air, and photoswitchable CPL properties upon altering different UV irradiation. Based on two chiral emission centers and their different characteristics, reversible CPL switches are realized upon a diversity of external stimuli, for example, chemicals (water /CH3NH3Br solution) or temperatures (room temperature/high temperature). Benefiting from the extraordinary stimuli&#8208;responsive and highly reversible switchable CPL, multiple information encryptions and decryptions integrated with CPL, together with a chiroptical logic gate are successfully designed. This work opens a new avenue to generally fabricate solid&#8208;state CPL composite materials and develops new applications based on switchable CPL.

         <title>Doping Control of Magnetic Anisotropy for Stable Antiskyrmion Formation in Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. It is demonstrated that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy, and subtle balance between uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, vortex&#8208;like topological spin textures, have attracted much interest in a wide range of research fields from fundamental physics to spintronics applications. Recently, growing attention is also paid to antiskyrmions emerging with opposite topological charge in non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnets with D2d or S4 symmetry. In these magnets, complex interplay among anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic dipolar interactions generates various magnetic textures. However, the precise role of these magnetic interactions in stabilizing antiskyrmions remains to be elucidated. In this work, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. The authors&#8217; magnetometry study, supported by ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, shows that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy. In particular, doping with Pd induces easy&#8208;axis anisotropy, giving rise to formation of antiskyrmions, while a temperature&#8208;induced spin reorientation is observed in an Rh&#8208;doped compound. In combination with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, the stability of antiskyrmion as functions of uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is quantitatively analyzed, and demonstrated that subtle balance between them is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.

Abstract
Harvesting the narrow bandgap excitons of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes for the achievement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission has attracted intensive attention for its fundamental importance and practical application. Herein, the triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) CT organic complex is designed and fabricated via the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process, which demonstrates the NIR emission with a maximum peak of 770&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.4%. The segregated stacking mode of TP&#8208;F4TCNQ CT complex based on the multiple types of intermolecular interaction has a low CT degree of 0.00103 and a small counter pitch angle of 40&#176; between F4TCNQ and TP molecules, which breaks the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state, resulting in the effective NIR emission. Acting as the promising candidates for the active optical waveguide in the NIR region beyond 760&#160;nm, the self&#8208;assembled TP&#8208;F4TCNQ single&#8208;crystalline organic microwires display an ultralow optical&#8208;loss coefficient of 0.060&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. This work holds considerable insights for the exploration of novel NIR&#8208;emissive organic materials via an universal &#8220;cocrystal engineering&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Constructing Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cell with Efficiency of 22.0% via Reduced Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss and Broadened Absorption Spectra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing ClFA+ cation to reduce the voltage loss of perovskite front subcell and using chloride substitution to broaden the absorption spectra of organic rear subcell, a monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell is constructed, and the power conversion efficiency reaches 22.0%.








Abstract
Combining the high stability under UV light of the wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) and the broad near&#8208;infrared absorption spectra of the narrow bandgap (NBG) organic solar cells (OSCs), the perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as front cell and the NBG OSC as rear cell have attracted attention . However, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite/organic TSCs needs to be further improved. Herein, nonradiative charge recombination loss is reduced through bulk defect passivation in the WBG pero&#8208;SC front subcell and broadening the range of absorption spectra of the NBG OSC rear cell. For the WBG pero&#8208;SCs, an organic cation chloro&#8208;formamidinium is introduced into FA0.6MA0.4Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 to passivate the bulk defects in the perovskite film and the WBG pero&#8208;SC displays high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and high fill factor of 83.0%. For the NBG OSCs, a new infrared&#8208;absorbing organic small molecule acceptor BTPV&#8208;4Cl&#8208;eC9 is designed and synthesized. Then, a monolithic perovskite/organic TSC is fabricated with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as the front cell and the NBG OSC as the rear cell, and the TSC demonstrates high power conversion efficiency up to 22.0%. The results indicate that the perovskite/organic TSC is promising for future commercialization.

         <title>Andreev Interference in the Surface Accumulation Layer of Half&#8208;Shell InAsSb/Al Hybrid Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. The gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al hybrid nanowires is studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field.








Abstract
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. In this letter, the gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al nanowires is studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field. Both uniform hybrid nanowires and devices featuring a short Josephson junction fabricated by shadow lithography, exhibit periodic modulation of the switching current. The period corresponds to a flux quantum through the nanowire diameter and is consistent with Andreev bound states occupying a cylindrical surface accumulation layer. The spatial distribution is tunable by a gate potential as expected from electrostatic models.

         <title>Vertical Extrusion Cryo(bio)printing for Anisotropic Tissue Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting technique is reported, which concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. This method is further extended to a multimaterial format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.








Abstract
Due to the poor mechanical properties of many hydrogel bioinks, conventional 3D extrusion bioprinting is usually conducted based on the X&#8211;Y plane, where the deposited layers are stacked in the Z&#8208;direction with or without the support of prior layers. Herein, a technique is reported, taking advantage of a cryoprotective bioink to enable direct extrusion bioprinting in the vertical direction in the presence of cells, using a freezing plate with precise temperature control. Of interest, vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. Skeletal myoblasts within the 3D&#8208;cryo&#8208;bioprinted hydrogel constructs show enhanced cell viability, spreading, and alignment, compared to the same cells in the standard hydrogel constructs. This method is further extended to a multimaterial format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, such as creation of the muscle&#8211;tendon unit and the muscle&#8211;microvascular unit. The unique vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting technique presented here suggests improvements in robustness and versatility to engineer certain tissue types especially those anisotropic in nature, and may extend broad utilities in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Growing a Tenacious Hydrogel Coating from a Sticky Initiation Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative modification method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization from a sticky initiation layer, based on in situ interface redox mechanism, is proposed for mildly/controllably growing hydrogel coatings on practically any substrate's (natural or artificial materials)/medical device's surface regardless of surface topology and material category.








Abstract
Controllably coating the surfaces of substrates/medical devices with hydrogels exhibits great application potential, but lacks universal techniques. Herein, a new method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization (UV&#8208;SCIRP) from a sticky initiation layer (SIL) (SIL@UV&#8208;SCIRP), is proposed for growing hydrogel coatings. The method involves three key steps: 1) depositing a sticky polydopamine/Fe3+ coating on the surface of the substrates&#8208;SIL, 2) reducing Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions as active catalysts by UV illumination with the assistance of citric acid, and 3) conducting SCIRP in a monomer solution at room temperature for growing hydrogel coatings. In this manner, practically any substrate's surface (natural or artificial materials) can be modified by hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness and diverse compositions. The hydrogel coatings exhibit good interface bonding with the substrates and enable easy changes in their wettability and lubrication performances. Importantly, this novel method facilitates the smooth growth of uniform hydrogel lubrication coatings on the surface of a range of medical devices with complex geometries. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the slippery balls coated with hydrogel exhibited smooth movement within the catheter and esophagus. Hence, this method can prove to be a pioneering universal modification tool, especially in surface/interface science and engineering.

         <title>High&#8208;Polarizability Organic Ferroelectric Materials Doping for Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric field of Perovskite Solar Cells Realizing Efficiency over 24%</title>

Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) intensity of silicon heterojunction solar cells can be easily enhanced by selective doping to obtain high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), while it has been challenging for perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Herein, we report an effective method to enhance the BEF of FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite by doping an organic ferroelectric material, polyvinylidene fluoride:dabcoHReO4 (PVDF:DH) with high polarizability, that can be driven even by the BEF of the device itself. The polarization of PVDF:DH produces an additional electric field, which is maintained permanently and in a direction consistent with that of the BEF of the pero&#8208;SC. The BEF superposition&#160;can more sufficiently drive the charge&#8208;carrier transport and extraction, thus suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination occurring in the pero&#8208;SCs. Moreover, the PVDF:DH dopant benefits the formation of a mesoporous PbI2 film, via a typical two&#8208;step processing method, thereby promoting perovskite growth with a high crystallinity and few defects. The resulting pero&#8208;SC shows a promising PCE of 24.23% for a 0.062&#8208;cm2 device (certified PCE of 23.45%), and a remarkable PCE of 22.69% for a 1&#8208;cm2 device, along with significantly improved moisture resistances and operational stabilities.

         <title>Anti&#8208;freezing Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ternary Hydrogen Bonding for High Performance zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The new generation flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries require enhanced mechanical property and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications. This fundamentally desires the hydrogel electrolyte to possess anti&#8208;freezing merits to resist the flexibility loss and performance decreasing at subzero temperatures. Herein, a highly flexible polysaccharide hydrogel is in&#8208;situ realized and regulated in zinc&#8208;ion batteries through the Hofmeister effect with the low concentration Zn(ClO4)2 salts to satisfy the abovementioned requirements. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions, water and polymer chains can form ternary and weak hydrogen bonding (HB), which enables the polymer chains with improved mechanical properties, breaks the HB of water to remarkably decrease the electrolyte freezing point, and reduces the amounts of free water for effectively side reaction and dendrite inhibiting. Consequently, even at &#8208;30&#160;&#176;C, the Zn(ClO4)2 in&#8208;situ optimized hydrogel electrolyte features a high ionic conductivity of 7.8 mS cm&#8722;1 and excellent flexibility, which enables the Zn/PANI battery with a reversible capacity of 70&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 under 5 A g&#8722;1 for 2500 cycles, and renders the flexible full battery with excellent cycling performances under different bending angles. This work provides a new pathway for designing high performance anti&#8208;freezing flexible batteries via the Hofmeister effect.

&lt;p&gt;The new generation flexible aqueous zinc-ion batteries require enhanced mechanical property and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications.

         <title>Urine Microenvironment&#8208;Initiated Composite Hydrogel Patch Reconfiguration Propels Scarless Memory Repair and Reinvigoration of Urethra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Harsh urine microenvironment (UME) as an inherent hurdle endangers and renders urethral repair unreachable. Innovatively, we utilized the unfavorable UME as the design source to construct a UME&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch for realizing scarless memory repair, wherein laser&#8208;excited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mechanical strength elevation using chemically&#8208;crosslinked silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) are accessible. Intriguingly, the proposed composite scaffolds can respond to Ca2+ in urine, cause structure reconfiguration, and repress swelling to further enhance scaffold stiffness. Systematic experiments validate that ROS birth and unexpected stiffness elevation in such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds can realize scarless memory repair of urethra in vivo. Comprehensive mechanism explorations uncover that the activations of cell proliferation and collagen&#8208;related genes (e.g., MMP&#8208;1 and COL3A1) and the dampening of fibrosis&#8208;related (e.g., TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) and mechanosensitive genes (e.g., YAP/TAZ) are responsible for the scarless memory repair of such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, decreasing fibrosis and inflammation and accelerating angiogenesis. The design rationales (e.g., UME&#8208;initiated structure reconfiguration and anti&#8208;swelling) can serve as an instructive and general approach for urethra repair.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polymer Nanoparticles for Efficient Delivery of Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein With or Without Donor DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). However, clinical transition of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, we report facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ&#8208;NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR&#8208;NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm). Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ&#8208;NP induced efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR&#8208;NP also led to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ&#8208;NP and HDR&#8208;NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.

Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, including zinc&#8208;iodine redox flow batteries and static zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, are promising candidates for future grid&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage. They are safe with great theoretical capacity, high energy and power density. Nevertheless, to make aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries practically feasible, there are quite a few hurdles need to be overcome, including self&#8208;discharge, sluggish kinetics, low energy density, and instability of Zn metal anodes. This article first reviews the electrochemistry in aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, including the flow and static battery configurations and their electrode reactions. Then we discuss the fundamental questions of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries and highlight the key strategies and recent accomplishments in tackling the challenges. Last, we share our thoughts on the future research development in aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;Functionalized Conductive Polymer Hydrogels for Electromagnetic&#8208;Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for 3D printing to precisely create 3D architectures with high design freedom and a post&#8208;printing freeze&#8211;thawing treatment protocol is proposed to transform the as&#8208;printed objects into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale, enabling customizable applications.








Abstract
The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI&#8208;shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze&#8211;thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale. The as&#8208;obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m&#8211;1 at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI&#8208;shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state of the art.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Nanofilm Electrode Arrays for Long&#8208;Term Stable Neural Interfacings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes are developed. The NEAs are encapsulated into biodissolvable polymer carriers through an efficient elastocapillary self&#8208;assembly process, enabling their reliable implantation into deep brain tissues. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months.








Abstract
Flexible neural electrodes integrated on micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates offer important opportunities for improving the stability of neuronal activity recordings during cognitive processes. However, the bending stiffness of micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates is typically two orders of magnitude higher than that of nanofilm electrodes, making it a limiting factor in electrode&#8208;tissue interfacings. Here, this limitation is overcome by developing self&#8208;assembled nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months. As an application example, the activities of the same neuronal populations are tracked across odor discrimination reversal learning and it is illustrated how dorsal striatal neurons represent and update stimulus&#8208;outcome associations across multiple timescales. The results underscore the potential of free&#8208;standing nanoscale materials for interfacing biological systems over long terms.

         <title>Soluble Organic Cathodes Enable Long Cycle Life, High Rate, and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic cathodes are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life, excellent rate capability, and a wide operation temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on bi&#8208;functional gel polymer electrolytes, which can eliminate the shuttling of the soluble organic electrode materials through molecular sieving and charge repulsion while maintaining a fast reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials free of rare transition metal elements are promising for sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign battery chemistries. However, severe shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of active materials in liquid electrolytes results in fast capacity decay, limiting their practical applications. Here, using a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) that is in situ formed on Nafion&#8208;coated separators, the shuttle reaction of organic electrodes is eliminated while maintaining the electrochemical performance. The synergy of physical confinement by GPE with tunable polymer structure and charge repulsion of the Nafion&#8208;coated separator substantially prevents the soluble organic electrode materials with different molecular sizes from shuttling. A soluble small&#8208;molecule organic electrode material of 1,3,5&#8208;tri(9,10&#8208;anthraquinonyl)benzene demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 10&#8239;000 cycles, excellent rate capability of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C, and a wide working temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on the solid&#8211;liquid conversion chemistry, which outperforms all previously reported organic cathode materials. The shielding capability of GPE can be designed and tailored toward organic electrodes with different molecular sizes, thus providing a universal resolution to the shuttling effect that all soluble electrode materials suffer.

         <title>Efficiency of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Sensitized Triplet Upconversion Doubled in Three&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the first three&#8208;component metal&#8208;free photon upconversion system on the upconversion efficiency and threshold light intensity is studied herein. While the efficiency is doubled, the threshold light intensity is also increased. The performance enhancement can be attributed to more efficient energy transfer from the sensitizer to the intermediate acceptor in combination with a high quantum yield emitter molecule.








Abstract
As in many fields, the most exciting endeavors in photon upconversion research focus on increasing the efficiency (upconversion quantum yield) and performance (anti&#8208;Stokes shift) while diminishing the cost of production. In this vein, studies employing metal&#8208;free thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers have garnered increased interest. Here, for the first time, the strategy of ternary photon upconversion is utilized with the TADF sensitizer 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN), resulting in a doubling of the upconversion quantum yield in comparison to the binary system employing p&#8208;terphenyl as the emitter. In this ternary blend, the sensitizer 4CzIPN is paired with an intermediate acceptor, 1&#8208;methylnaphthalene, in addition to the emitter molecule, p&#8208;terphenyl, yielding a normalized upconversion quantum yield of 7.6% while maintaining the 0.83&#160;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift. These results illustrate the potential benefits of utilizing this strategy of energy&#8208;funneling, previously used only with heavy&#8208;metal based sensitizers, to increase the performance of these photon upconversion systems.

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancement of piezoelectricity by external stimuli is advantageous for its simple and in situ control, and compatibility with other functionalities. In this work, light is shown to be a powerful control parameter to induce a sevenfold enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient in BiFeO3 single crystals due to the bulk photovoltaic and Schottky barrier effects, offering potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches are well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored, despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, it is shown that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of BiFeO3 single crystals. A series of measurements based on piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, under illumination, reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a sevenfold increase. This phenomenon is explained with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open&#8208;circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Sprayed Starvation/Chemodynamic Therapeutic Gel for Post&#8208;Surgical Treatment of IDH1 (R132H) Glioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel of GOx@MnCaP@fibrin is developed for post&#8208;surgical treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma, through depleting intratumoral glucose and generating high levels of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Complete resection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma is unfeasible and the classic post&#8208;surgical chemo/radiotherapy suffers from high recurrence and low survival rate. IDH1 (R132H) cells are sensitive to low concentrations of glucose and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inherent metabolism reprograming. Hence, a starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel is developed to combat residual IDH1 (R132H) tumor cells after surgery. Briefly, glucose oxidase (GOx) is mineralized with manganese&#8208;doped calcium phosphate to form GOx@MnCaP nanoparticles, which are encapsulated into the fibrin gel (GOx@MnCaP@fibrin). After spraying gel in the surgical cavity, GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in residual IDH1 (R132H) cells and produces H2O2. The generated H2O2 is further converted into highly lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) by a Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction to further kill the residual IDH1 (R132H) cells. The as&#8208;prepared starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel shows much higher therapeutic efficacy toward IDH1 (R132H) cells than IDH1 (WT) cells, and achieves long&#8208;term survival.

         <title>Shielding Ferritin with a Biomineralized Shell Enables Efficient Modulation of Tumor Microenvironment and Targeted Delivery of Diverse Therapeutic Agents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible ferritin&#8208;based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which calcium phosphate is generated on the ferritin surface. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables efficient drug delivery to tumor and powerful tumor microenvironment modulation, but also brings additional functionalities by loading diverse drugs in the cavity and the shell for potent antitumor effects on multiple cell and patient&#8208;derived xenografts.








Abstract
Ferritin (Fn) is considered a promising carrier for targeted delivery to tumors, but the successful application in vivo has not been fully achieved yet. Herein, strong evidence is provided that the Fn receptor is expressed in liver tissues, resulting in an intercept effect in regards to tumor delivery. Building on these observations, a biomineralization technology is rationally designed to shield Fn using a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell, which can improve the delivery performance by reducing Fn interception in the liver while re&#8208;exposing it in acidic tumors. Moreover, the selective dissolution of the CaP shell not only neutralizes the acidic microenvironment but also induces the intratumoral immunomodulation and calcification. Upon multiple cell line and patient&#8208;derived xenografts, it is demonstrated that the elaboration of the highly flexible Fn@CaP chassis by loading a chemotherapeutic drug into the Fn cavity confers potent antitumor effects, and additionally encapsulating a photosensitizer into the outer shell enables a combined chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy for complete suppression of advanced tumors. Altogether, these results support Fn@CaP as a new nanoplatform for efficient modulation of the tumor microenvironment and targeted delivery of diverse therapeutic agents.

         <title>Immune Checkpoint Ligand Bioengineered Schwann Cells as Antigen&#8208;Specific Therapy for Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>

A translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 86&#8208;functionalized Schwann cells to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis is developed.








Abstract
Failure to establish immune tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune disease. The ability to regulate autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immunosuppression represents a major challenge in the development of new strategies to treat autoimmune disease. Here, a translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208; and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86)&#8208;functionalized mouse Schwann cells (SCs) to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis (MS) in established mouse models of chronic and relapsing&#8208;remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is described. It is shown that the intravenous (i.v.) administration of immune checkpoint ligand functionalized mouse SCs modifies the course of disease and ameliorates EAE. Further, it is found that such bioengineered mouse SCs inhibit the differentiation of myelin&#8208;specific helper T cells into pathogenic T helper type&#8208;1 (Th1) and type&#8208;17 (Th17) cells, promote the development of tolerogenic myelin&#8208;specific regulatory T (Treg) cells, and resolve inflammatory central nervous system microenvironments without inducing systemic immunosuppression.

&lt;p&gt;A translational method for bioengineering programmed death-ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 86-functionalized Schwann cells to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis is developed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to establish immune tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune disease. The ability to regulate autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immunosuppression represents a major challenge in the development of new strategies to treat autoimmune disease. Here, a translational method for bioengineering programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)- and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86)-functionalized mouse Schwann cells (SCs) to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis (MS) in established mouse models of chronic and relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is described. It is shown that the intravenous (i.v.) administration of immune checkpoint ligand functionalized mouse SCs modifies the course of disease and ameliorates EAE. Further, it is found that such bioengineered mouse SCs inhibit the differentiation of myelin-specific helper T cells into pathogenic T helper type-1 (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;1) and type-17 (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;17) cells, promote the development of tolerogenic myelin-specific regulatory T (T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;) cells, and resolve inflammatory central nervous system microenvironments without inducing systemic immunosuppression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Transport Properties of Gases in Porous Graphene Membranes with Controlled Pore Size and Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;separation membranes based on porous graphene (PG) offer ultimate permeance; however, they show low selectivity. The pore&#8208;narrowing approach, via gold deposition onto PG, allows both the thickness and the pore size of the membrane to be tuned to obtain a high number of pores below 3&#160;nm, enabling increased gas&#8211;surface interactions and molecular sieving for high gas selectivity and permeance.








Abstract
Porous graphene membranes have emerged as promising alternatives for gas&#8208;separation applications due to their atomic thickness enabling ultrahigh permeance, but they suffer from low gas selectivity. Whereas decreasing the pore size below 3&#160;nm is expected to increase the gas selectivity due to molecular sieving, it is rather challenging to generate a large number of uniform small pores on the graphene surface. Here, a pore&#8208;narrowing approach via gold deposition onto porous graphene surface is introduced to tune the pore size and thickness of the membrane to achieve a large number of small pores. Through the systematic approach, the ideal combination is determined as pore size below 3&#160;nm, obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm, to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane shows a H2/CO2 separation factor of 31.3 at H2 permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 105 GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;10&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1), which is the highest value reported to date in the 105 GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, &#8722;5.3&#160;versus &#8722;21&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for H2 and CO2, respectively, increased surface&#8211;gas interactions and molecular&#8208;sieving effect with decreasing pore size.

         <title>A Super&#8208;Boosted Hybrid Plasmonic Upconversion Process for Photodetection at 1550&#160;nm Wavelength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film. The plasmonic effect, super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, by MLA leads to superior sensitivity and responsivity of devices at weak near&#8208;infrared excitation powers.








Abstract
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Plasmonic metasurfaces and Au core&#8211;satellite nanoassembly (CSNA) films can strongly induce a more effective plasmonic effect by providing numerous hot spots in an intense local electromagnetic field up to wavelengths exceeding 1550&#160;nm. Hence, significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film comprising an Au CSNA and UC nanoparticles. Furthermore, an MLA polymer film is synergistically coupled with the HPU film, thereby focusing the incident near&#8208;infrared light in the micrometer region, including the plasmonic nanostructure area. Consequently, the plasmonic effect super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, significantly lowers the detectable power limit of a device, resulting in superior sensitivity and responsivity at weak excitation powers. Finally, a triple&#8208;cation perovskite&#8208;based photodetector coupled with the hybrid plasmonic UC film exhibits the excellent values of responsivity and detectivity of 9.80&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and 8.22&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at a weak power density of &#8776;0.03&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, demonstrating that the device performance is enhanced by more than 104 magnitudes over a reference sample.

         <title>A Hydrogel Ionic Circuit Based High&#8208;Intensity Iontophoresis Device for Intraocular Macromolecule and Nanoparticle Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC) is developed for highly effective intraocular delivery of macromolecule and nanoparticle drugs. The HIC&#8208;based device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87 mA cm&#8722;2) to the ocular tissue. Moreover, therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone in a nanoparticle formulation can be delivered to target tissues within 10&#8211;20 min of iontophoresis application.








Abstract
Iontophoresis is an electrical&#8208;current&#8208;based, noninvasive drug&#8208;delivery technology, which is particularly suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Current ocular iontophoresis devices use low current intensities that significantly limit macromolecule and nanoparticle (NP) delivery efficiency. Increasing current intensity leads to ocular tissue damage. Here, an iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC), for high&#8208;efficiency intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery, is described. The HIC&#8208;based device is capable of minimizing Joule heating, effectively buffering electrochemical (EC) reaction&#8208;generated pH changes, and absorbing electrode overpotential&#8208;induced heating. As a result, the device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, more than 10 times higher than current ocular iontophoresis devices) to the eye with minimal ocular cell death and tissue damage. The high&#8208;intensity iontophoresis significantly enhances macromolecule and NP delivery to both the anterior and posterior segments by up to 300 times compared to the conventional iontophoresis. Therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone are delivered to target tissue compartments within 10&#8211;20&#160;min of iontophoresis application. This study highlights the significant safety enhancement enabled by an HIC&#8208;based device design and the potential of the device to deliver therapeutic doses of macromolecule and NP ophthalmic drugs within a clinically relevant time frame.

         <title>Multivalent Noncovalent Interfacing and Cross&#8208;Linking of Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical synthetic supramolecular network is formed and interfaced to biomimetic surfaces using purely noncovalent interactions. Supramolecular synthetic copolymer bearing biotin linking group forms supramolecular networks upon addition of streptavidin, and can bind to streptavidin&#8208;modified surfaces. The architectures of these networks can be tuned by changing the biotin ratio in supramolecular copolymer and the concentration of streptavidin.








Abstract
Natural supramolecular filaments have the ability to cross&#8208;link with each other and to interface with the cellular membrane via biomolecular noncovalent interactions. This behavior allows them to form complex networks within as well as outside the cell, i.e., the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, respectively. The potential of artificial supramolecular polymers to interact through specific noncovalent interactions has so far only seen limited exploration due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions. Here, a system of synthetic supramolecular tubes that cross&#8208;link forming supramolecular networks, and at the same time bind to biomimetic surfaces by the aid of noncovalent streptavidin&#8211;biotin linkages, is demonstrated. The architecture of the networks can be engineered by controlling the density of the biotin moiety at the exterior of the tubes as well as by the concentration of the streptavidin. The presented strategy provides a pathway for designing adjustable artificial supramolecular superstructures, which can potentially yield more complex biomimetic adaptive materials.

The presented strategy provides a pathway for designing adjustable artificial supramolecular superstructures, which can potentially yield more complex biomimetic adaptive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lateral Fully Organic P&#8211;N Diodes Created in a Single Donor&#8211;Acceptor Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lateral fully organic P&#8211;N diodes can be created in a single polymer, which exhibits a high rectification ratio &#8776;2100 and a high current density 3.83 A cm&#8722;2. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.








Abstract
P&#8211;N junctions exist in many solid&#8208;state organic devices, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. Creating P&#8211;N junctions by bulk chemical doping in a single organic material (like silicon doped by boron and phosphorus) may capitalize the vast scientific and technological groundwork established in the inorganic semiconducting field. However, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;organic&#8208;material P&#8211;N junctions are seldom reported, because the diffusion of the dopant counterions often leads to transient rectification properties. Herein, a new type of lateral fully organic diodes created in single donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) copolymer films with only one P&#8208;type dopant is reported. The achieved lateral devices exhibit high current densities of &#8776;3.83 A cm&#8722;2 and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;2100, which are beyond the requirements for high&#8208;frequency identification tags. The P&#8208; to N&#8208;type polarity switching mechanism is proposed after spectroscopic and structural tests. Decent stability of the organic diode is obtained, which is due to the long channel length and low diffusion speed of the large size of dopants. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.

         <title>Cluster Fragments in Amorphous Phosphorus and their Evolution under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven simulations provide new insight into the structure of amorphous phosphorus. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings and more complex cluster fragments. The simulation results help to understand previous experimental observations at ambient and high pressure, and they provide an example of the emerging application of machine&#8208;learned potentials to complex functional materials.








Abstract
Amorphous phosphorus (a&#8208;P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a&#8208;P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here, it is shown that large&#8208;scale molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine&#8208;learning (ML)&#8208;based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a&#8208;P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings, as well as more complex seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium&#8208;range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. The work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a&#8208;P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML&#8208;driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one multifunctional Janus separator is prepared using interfacial engineering strategies to improve the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The reversibility of the Li&#8208;metal anode is greatly enhanced and the shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode is effectively suppressed. This work offers a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the metallic Li anode and the sulfur cathode in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208;dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of the anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains high&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus and high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen&#8208;group&#8208;grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), by which the formation of &#8220;hot spots&#8221; can be effectively avoid, the Li&#8208;ion flux homogenized, and dendrite growth suppressed. Meanwhile, at the interface between the separator and the cathode, the homogenously exposed single&#8208;atom Ru on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; polysulfides and reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of the Janus separator, a lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell using the Janus separator delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 310.2&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the Li anode and the sulfur cathode in LSBs.

         <title>Lattice Polarity Manipulation of Quasi&#8208;vdW Epitaxial GaN Films on Graphene Through Interface Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of the lattice polarity of quasi&#8208;vdW epitaxial GaN on graphene through controlling the interface atomic configuration is reported. This polarity&#8208;control rule is not affected by the growth method and is free of either crystalline or non&#8208;crystalline substrates. It makes the epitaxy of III&#8208;nitrides with preferred lattice polarity possible and improves the ability to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices.








Abstract
Quasi van der Waals epitaxy, a pioneering epitaxy of sp3&#8208;hybridized semiconductor films on sp2&#8208;hybridized 2D materials, provides a way, in principle, to achieve single&#8208;crystal epilayers with preferred atom configurations that are free of substrate. Unfortunately, this has not been experimentally confirmed in the case of the hexagonal semiconductor III&#8208;nitride epilayer until now. Here, it is reported that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity are achieved by forming C&#63743;O&#63743;N&#63743;Ga(3) or C&#63743;O&#63743;Ga&#63743;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&#63743;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen pre&#8208;irradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question of why those reported wurtzite III&#8208;nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layers grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8211;Mechanical Synergistic In Situ Multiscale Tissue Adhesion for Sustainable Residue&#8208;Free Bioelectronics Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic&#8211;mechanical, synergistic, in situ, multiscale tissue adhesion for various bioelectronic applications is demonstrated. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. Reliable real&#8208;time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are also successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity&#8208;assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long&#8208;term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, an electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue&#8208;free, sustainable, in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive is proposed. The model supports the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid&#8208;insensitive, sustainable, in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Atomic Fe&#8211;N4/C in Flexible Carbon Fiber Membrane as Binder&#8208;Free Air Cathode for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Stable Cycling over 1000 h</title>

Flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon membrane with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C sites is constructed and used as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In virtue of the hierarchical porous structures and optimized local atomic configurations, the as&#8208;synthesized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free membrane as binder&#8208;free air cathode demonstrates a stable cycling over 1000 h for Zn&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free, durable, and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are vital for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The large specific surface area exposes a high concentration of Fe&#8211;N4/C sites embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. The as&#8208;synthesized Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86&#160;V/94.74&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) and most reported M&#8211;Nx/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid&#8208;state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 and long&#8208;term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid&#8208;state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Nucleation and Shaping of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling self&#8208;assembly is fundamentally challenging with implications for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Herein, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Light patterns enable positioning of composites in preassigned locations, sculpting of fine details and contours, and commanding the assembly of lines over millimeters with micrometer precision, hence combining the power of photolithography with self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlling self&#8208;assembly of nanocomposites is a fundamental challenge with exciting implications for next&#8208;generation advanced functional materials. Precursors for composites can be generated photochemically, but limited insight in the underlying processes has hindered precise hands&#8208;on guidance. In this study, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Carbonate is generated photochemically with UV light to steer the precipitation of nanocomposites of barium carbonate nanocrystals and amorphous silica (BaCO3/SiO2). Using a custom&#8208;built optical setup, the self&#8208;assembly process is controlled by optimizing the photogeneration, diffusion, reaction, and precipitation of the carbonate species, using the radius and intensity of the UV&#8208;light irradiated area and reaction temperature. Exploiting this control, nucleation is induced and the contours and individual features of the growing composite are sculpted according to micrometer&#8208;defined light patterns. Moreover, moving light patterns are exploited to create a constant carbonate concentration at the growth front to draw lines of nanocomposites with constant width over millimeters with micrometer precision. Light&#8208;directed generation of local gradients opens previously unimaginable opportunities for guiding self&#8208;assembly into functional materials.

         <title>The Quest for Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling potassium&#8208;ion battery is demonstrated, using a K2MnFe(CN)6 Prussian white cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode, and a concentrated electrolyte. This full cell delivers a high energy density of 260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and stable cycling over 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted wide interest for energy storage because of the abundance of the electrode materials involved; however, their electrochemical performances are far behind what can be achieved from lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) or sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, key promising electrode and electrolyte materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries are identified, the coupled electrochemical reactions in the cell are investigated, and the compatibility between different materials is demonstrated to play the most important role. K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode can deliver a high capacity of &#8776;125 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability over 61&#160;000 cycles (&#8776;9 months) if the side reactions from the anode can be prevented. Graphite is a good anode material but is subjected to degradation in traditional carbonate electrolytes. New concentrated electrolytes are developed and evaluated. A stable KIB system is demonstrated by coupling a stable K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode with a concentrated electrolyte to achieve a high energy density of &#8776;260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and good cycling of over 1000 cycles.

Two novel small&#8208;molecule donors with thioalkyl chains in the para&#8208; (P&#8208;PhS) and the meta&#8208;position (M&#8208;PhS) are synthesized to regulate surface tension and molecular packing. An optimized morphology with small domains and ordered packing is simultanously obtained in the M&#8208;PhS:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, promoting a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.2% with excellent (FF&#160;&#215; Jsc) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs).








Abstract
In all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs), a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) usually needs a small phase separation, while a high fill factor (FF) is generally realized in a highly ordered packing system. However, small domain and ordered packing always conflicted each other in ASM&#8208;OSCs, leading to a mutually restricted Jsc and FF. In this study, alleviation of the previous dilemma by the strategy of obtaining simultaneous good miscibility and ordered packing through modulating homo&#8208; and heteromolecular interactions is proposed. By moving the alkyl&#8208;thiolation side chains from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208;position in the small&#8208;molecule donor, the surface tension and molecular planarity are synchronously enhanced, resulting in compatible properties of good miscibility with acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9 and strong self&#8208;assembly ability. As a result, an optimized morphology with multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale domains and highly ordered packing is realized. The device exhibits a long carrier lifetime (39.8 &#956;s) and fast charge collection (15.5&#160;ns). A record efficiency of 16.2% with a high FF of 75.6% and a Jsc of 25.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the ASM&#8208;OSCs is obtained. These results demonstrate that the strategy of simultaneously obtaining good miscibility with high crystallinity could be an efficient photovoltaic material design principle for high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Scalable Polyimide&#8208;Poly(Amic Acid) Copolymer Based Nanocomposites for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To develop scalable, high&#8208;temperature capacitors, polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymer&#8208;based nanocomposites with very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed. The outstanding energy density of &#8776;1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;96%&#160;is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C under 200 MV m&#8722;1 (working conditions in hybrid electric vehicles), &#8776;2.5 times higher than the room&#8208;temperature performance of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biaxially oriented polypropylene.








Abstract
The developments of next&#8208;generation electric power systems and electronics demand for high temperature (&#8776;150&#160;&#176;C), high energy density, high efficiency, scalable, and low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;based dielectric capacitors are still scarce. Here, the nanocomposites based on polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymers with a very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed and synthesized. Under the actual working condition in hybrid electric vehicles of 200 MV m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, a high energy density of 1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency higher than 96% is achieved. This is about 2.5 times higher than the room temperature energy density (&#8776;0.39 J cm&#8722;3 under 200 MV m&#8722;1) of the commercially used biaxially oriented polypropylene, the benchmark of dielectric polymer. Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#160;&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20&#160;000 cycles of charge&#8208;discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high&#8208;temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low&#8208;cost strategy to develop high&#8208;temperature polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

         <title>In Situ Architecting Endogenous Heterojunction of MoS2 Coupling with Mo2CTx MXenes for Optimized Li+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX is constructed in situ. The obtained hetero&#8208;Mo2C shows extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with reversible structural transformation. Moreover, the improved capability of electron and ion transport endows hetero&#8208;Mo2C electrode with superior lithium storage performance, which surpasses all reported Mo2C MXenes electrode materials.








Abstract
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications, which is impeded by complex synthesis method and finite MAX materials. Herein, an in situ hydrothermal strategy is implemented to successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx (hetero&#8208;Mo2C) directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure caused by the introduction of MoS2 endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with improved charge transport and lithium ion adsorption capabilities. As a result, hetero&#8208;Mo2C exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 1242 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and long cycle stability of 683.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycling. This work provides new insights into rational design of novel MXenes heterojunctions, practically important for the development of MXenes and their applications in high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

Abstract
Enzyme immobilization in the confines of microfluidic chips, that promote enzyme activity and stability, has become a powerful strategy to enhance biocatalysis and biomass conversion. Here, based on a newly developed all&#8208;liquid microfluidic chip, fabricated by the interfacial assembly of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) in a biphasic system, a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of a microchannel, greatly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization, is presented. Using horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase as model enzymes, all&#8208;liquid microfluidic enzymatic and cascade reactors have been constructed and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap nonfused nonfullerene acceptor named GS&#8208;ISO is designed and synthesized. GS&#8208;ISO exhibits a very flat molecular backbone and stable molecular conformation. Based on GS&#8208;ISO, outstanding power conversion efficiencies of over 19% (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for a tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell and over 28% (500&#160;lux, 2700&#160;K LED) for an indoor OPV cell are achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with nonfused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, NFAs named GS&#8208;OEH, GS&#8208;OC6, and GS&#8208;ISO, with optical bandgaps larger than 1.70&#160;eV, are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS&#8208;OEH and GS&#8208;OC6, GS&#8208;ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS&#8208;ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based cell with effective area of 1.0&#160;cm2&#160;exhibits a PCE of 28.37% under 2700&#160;K illumination of 500&#160;lux. A tandem OPV cell using PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO as the front subcell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based OPV cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing nonfused NFAs and also that GS&#8208;ISO is a promising WBG acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Photoconductivity Caused by Surface Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Stannates with Ultraviolet Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressure can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. Utilizing surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient, ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of the perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially&#160;confined and optically&#160;programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.








Abstract
Programmable optoelectronic devices call for the reversible control of the photocarrier recombination process by in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancies as a source of in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors have hampered the reversible formation of oxygen vacancies and their related phenomena. Here, a new strategy to manipulate the 2D photoconductivity from perovskite stannates is demonstrated by exploiting spatially&#160;selective photochemical reaction under ultraviolet illumination at room temperature. Remarkably, the ideal trap&#8208;free photocurrent of air&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;200&#160;pA) is reversibly switched into three orders of magnitude higher photocurrent of vacuum&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;335&#160;nA) with persistent photoconductivity depending on ambient oxygen pressure under illumination. Multiple characterizations elucidate that ultraviolet illumination of BaSnO3&#160;under low oxygen pressure induces surface oxygen vacancies as a result of surface photolysis combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient of BaSnO3; the concentrated oxygen vacancies are likely to induce a two&#8208;step transition of photocurrent response by changing the characteristics of in&#8208;gap states from the shallow level to the deep level. These results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8211;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#160;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Manipulating Electroluminochromism Behavior of Viologen&#8208;Substituted Iridium(III) Complexes through Ligand Engineering for Information Display and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes is designed to manipulate their electroluminochromism behavior. By attaching pyridiniums to the diimine or cyclometalating ligand and judiciously selecting the co&#8208;ligands, luminescence response to electrical stimuli is achieved in intensity, wavelength, and lifetime, which demonstrates anti&#8208;counterfeiting display through naked&#8208;eye detection, near&#8208;infrared camera, or time&#8208;resolved luminescence.








Abstract
Electrically controlling photoluminescence has attracted great research interest and offers many opportunities for technological developments. Electroluminochromic materials undergo redox reactions under low&#8208;voltage stimuli to achieve reversible luminescence switching. Till now, photoluminescence switching of a single molecule caused by electrical stimuli is restricted to intensity response because the redox&#8208;active moieties are good electron donors or acceptors and electrical stimuli can regulate the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer and affect the luminescence intensity. In this work, the manipulation of the electroluminochromism behavior of a series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes through the regulation of ligand orbital energy levels and electronic communication between the viologen pendants and the iridium(III) complex core is reported. Electrochemical redox reactions reversibly modulate either the luminescence quenching effect or the push&#8211;pull electronic effect of the viologen substituents, achieving multicolor &#8220;on&#8211;off&#8221; luminescence response toward electrical stimuli and luminescence manipulation between two emissive states with different wavelengths and lifetimes. To illustrate the promising applications of these electroluminochromic materials, recording and displaying luminescence information under electrical stimuli are demonstrated. Information encryption is realized by letting the electroluminochromism occur in the near&#8208;infrared region or in the time domain. Near&#8208;infrared camera or time&#8208;resolved luminescence analysis can be used to help read the invisible information.

A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hafnium oxide (HfO2)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered, ultrafast (60 &#181;s), and high&#8208;performing (68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1) infrared pyroelectric sensor is developed. Further, a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory with controllable suspension and reestablishment of self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse is demonstrated. Using the innovative approach, advanced applications like memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency warning systems are offered.








Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8776; 60 &#181;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 is developed. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of the self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse are demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory. Potentially, the novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

The MMP&#8208;2&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) loading guanidinobenzoic acid&#8208;modified generation 5 polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;GBA)/Smad3&#8208;small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticles (siRNA@MS) were fabricated by microfluidics technique, and then were incorporated into a self&#8208;healing hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel (siRNA@MS@HA) on the polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibers to form peritendinous anti&#8208;adhesion membrane. Here it is hypothesized that Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles would be released from GelMA MSs responded to the elevation of MMP&#8208;2 after tendon injury, thus downregulating the expression of Smad3 and fibroblast proliferation in peritendinous area. Moreover, the hydrogel&#8208;electrospun nanofibers could attenuate inflammation and act as a physical barrier to prevent adhesion tissue invading into the repaired tendon.








Abstract
Antiadhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self&#8208;healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel is constructed as a peritendinous antiadhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2)&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles are entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. GelMA MSs are responsively degraded by upregulation of MMP&#8208;2, achieving on&#8208;demand release of siRNA nanoparticles. Silencing effect of Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles is around 75% toward targeted gene. Furthermore, the self&#8208;healing hydrogel shows relatively attenuated inflammation compared to non&#8208;healing hydrogel. The mean adhesion scores of composite barrier group are 1.67 &#177; 0.51 and 2.17 &#177; 0.75 by macroscopic and histological evaluation, respectively. The proposed self&#8208;healing hydrogel antiadhesion barrier with MMP&#8208;2&#8208;responsive drug release behavior is highly effective for decreasing inflammation and inhibiting tendon adhesion. Therefore, this research provides a new strategy for the development of safe and effective antiadhesion barriers.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Polymerization of AIEgens for Light&#8208;Up Tumor Localization and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen&#8208;peptide conjugates (D2P1) and 3CBT that can undergo in situ polymerization to form aggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin B enzyme reactions, the peptide cleavage on D2P1 induces covalent polymerization between 3CBT, which triggers aggregation and accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal and tumor treatment efficacy.








Abstract
Improving the enrichment of drugs or theranostic agents within tumors is vital to achieve effective cancer diagnosis and therapy with reduced dosage and damage to normal tissues. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;mediated aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen (AIEgen) intracellular polymerization strategy that can simultaneously promote the accumulation and retention of the AIEgen in the tumor for prolonged imaging and enhanced tumor growth inhibition is described. An AIEgen&#8208;peptide conjugate (D2P1) and cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;cysteine (3CBT) that can undergo rapid condensation reaction to form nanoaggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light&#8208;up. Such enzyme&#8208;mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built&#8208;in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 can remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme&#8208;mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescence from Pillar&#8208;Layer MOFs by Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient (QYphos.&#160;= 80.6%), long&#8208;lived (169.7&#160;ms) blue phosphorescence has been achieved in pillar&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on the isolation and lock of ligand chromophores. The potential applications of these phosphors in 3D printing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and fingerprint visualization have been demonstrated owing to the excellent chemical and mechanical stability.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy&#8208;metal containing complexes and purely organic systems. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long&#8208;lived lifetimes. Taking the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a model, herein, a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization is proposed, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long&#8208;lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co&#8208;ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores&#8217; motions through coordination and host&#8208;guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with highly efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization have been also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

         <title>Tailored Double Emulsions Made Simple</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method is developed to produce double emulsions of a single core and a thin shell at a milliliter per minute production rate, requiring minimal instrumentation, cost, and expertise. This two&#8208;step emulsification technique offers control of shell thickness, diversity of liquid formulations, integration with microfluidic devices, and potential to scale&#8208;up.








Abstract
Double emulsions, such as water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplets, are important material platforms for conducting fundamental research and for technological applications. To date, well&#8208;defined double&#8208;emulsion droplets consisting of a single water core and a thin oil shell can be exclusively formed with sophisticated microfluidic devices. The fabrication, preparation, and operation of such devices is challenging, which reduces the availability of tailored double emulsions to a limited community of experts. Here, a simple method is introduced to produce single&#8208;core double emulsions with high yield in large quantities, using a vortex mixer. Utilizing the density difference between the dispersed droplet and the continuous phase, this two&#8208;step emulsification method can achieve very small core droplet diameters below 10 &#956;m and ultrathin shells with thicknesses below 1 &#956;m. A detailed picture of the formation mechanism is provided and it is demonstrated that the process can be extended to produce multishell and multicore emulsions. Finally, its application is demonstrated to produce structurally colored colloidal supraparticles with unprecedented uniformity and yield. The method allows the creation of tailored double emulsions with minimal time, cost, effort, and expertise, and may widen its application to nonspecialized scientific communities.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted 4D Programming and Reprogramming of Liquid Crystalline Organogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropic approach is reported to program and reprogram the molecular ordering in liquid crystalline organogels via directed solvent evaporation. A wide variety of active origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of 3D printed LCNs with unattainable spatial and temporal control can be readily reached without meticulous alignment during network formation.








Abstract
Encoding molecular ordering during liquid crystalline network (LCN) formation endows preprogrammed but fixed shape morphing in response to external stimuli. The incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds enables shape reprogramming but also permanently alters the network structures. Here, an entropic approach that can program complex shapes via directed solvent evaporation from an isotropic LCN organogel is discoursed. Different shapes can be erased and reprogrammed from the same LCN on demand depending on the modes of deformation of the organogel during solvent evaporation. The ability to decouple network synthesis and molecular alignment relaxes the requirements to LCN chemistry and alignment methods, allowing for the realization of a variety of origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of LCNs printed from the digital light processing technique with unattainable spatial and temporal controls.

The ability to decouple network synthesis and molecular alignment relaxes the requirements to LCN chemistry and alignment methods, allowing for the realization of a variety of origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of LCNs printed from the digital light processing technique with unattainable spatial and temporal controls.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Metal Phosphide&#8211;Phosphate Support Interaction for Enhanced Non&#8208;Noble Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for heterogeneous catalysis but limited by reducible oxide supports and the activity and stability contradiction. A new strong metal phosphide&#8211;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI) induced by P activation is reported for the non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with superior hydrogenation activity, stability, anti&#8208;oxidant and anti&#8208;acid capacity.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for supported catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Here is the first report on strong metal phosphide&#8208;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI). The key to SMPSI is the activation of P species on the support, which leads to simultaneous generation of metal phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) and core&#8211;shell nanostructures formed by support migration onto the NPs. The encapsulation state of metal phosphide and charge transfer are identical to those of classical SMSIs and can be optimally regulated. Furthermore, the strong interactions of Co2PL/MnP&#8208;3 not only significantly enhance the anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;acid capability of non&#8208;noble metal but also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability toward hydrogenating a wide range of compounds into value&#8208;added fine chemicals with 100% selectivity, which is even better than Pd/C and Pt/C. The SMPSI construction can be generally extended to other systems such as Ni2PL/Mn3(PO4)2, Co2PL/LaPO4, and CoPL/CePO4. This study provides a new approach for the rational design of advanced non&#8208;noble metal catalysts and introduce a novel paradigm for the strong interaction between NPs and support.

         <title>Toward Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens&#8217; Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces based on disordered arrangements of silicon nanoresonators are used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective optical diffusers with nearly Lambertian scattering profiles and a high tolerance for incidence angles and polarizations. Their working principles and scattering performances are discussed on the basis of exhaustive experimental and numerical studies. Such diffusers open new opportunities in applications like fluorescence microscopy, augmented reality displays, or wavefront&#8208;shaping.








Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. This work explores how dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces can implement wavelength&#8208;selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. The combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is shown to be an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. The proposed metasurfaces&#8217; directional scattering performance is characterized both experimentally and numerically, and their usability in wavefront&#8208;shaping applications is highlighted. Since the metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality displays.

         <title>Cell Sheet&#8208;Like Soft Nanoreactor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#160;nm&#8208;thick soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays are designed to confine and guide the inward crystallization of nanocrystals. Such cell&#8208;like soft nanoreactor sheets change the reaction kinetics and offer a general platform to synthesize a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures that are difficult to achieve using traditional bulk solution&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
Tissues, which consist of groups of closely packed cell arrays, are essentially sheet&#8208;like biosynthesis plants. In tissues, individual cells are discrete microreactors working under highly viscous and confined environments. Herein, soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays, as analogous nanoscale &#8220;sheet&#8208;like chemosynthesis plants&#8221;, for the controlled synthesis of novel nanocrystals, are reported. Although the soft polystyrene (PS) is only 3&#160;nm thick, it is elastic, robust, and permeable to aqueous solutes, while significantly slowing down their diffusion. PEN&#8208;associated palladium (Pd) crystallization follows a diffusion&#8208;controlled zero&#8208;order kinetics rather than a reaction&#8208;controlled first&#8208;order kinetics in bulk solution. Each individual PEN reactor has a volume in the zeptoliter range, which offers a unique confined environment, enabling a directional inward crystallization, in contrast to the conventional outward nucleation/growth that occurs in an unconfined bulk solution. This strategy makes it possible to generate a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures, which are difficult to achieve with normal systems based on bulk solutions.

         <title>Electronically and Geometrically Modified Single&#8208;Atom Fe Sites by Adjacent Fe Nanoparticles for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlations between electronic and geometric structures of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance are investigated by varying the secondary heat&#8208;treatment of a NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst. The adjacent Fe nanoparticles can regulate the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites, reducing energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials exhibit excellent activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most promising candidates to replace commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, it is challenging to unravel features of the superior ORR activity originating from Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials. In this work, the electronic and geometric structures of the isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their correlations with the ORR performance are investigated by varying the secondary thermal activation temperature of a rationally designed NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC). The systematic analyses demonstrate the significant role of coordinated atoms of SA and metallic Fe nanoparticles (NPs) in altering the electronic structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Meanwhile, strong interaction between isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and adjacent Fe NPs can change the geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that optimal regulation of the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites by the co&#8208;existence of Fe NPs narrows the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance. This work not only provides the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationship, but also sheds light on designing efficient Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging at 1550&#160;nm Boosts Orthotopic Glioblastoma Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of nanofluorophores is a promising approach for theranostic of orthotopic glioma. Brain&#8208;targeting nanofluorophores featuring novel molecular design of &#8220;backbone distortion + molecular rotor&#8221; are prepared. They can balance the photon energy flow to achieve advanced NIR&#8208;II imaging at 1550&#160;nm and photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat ratio for PTT in orthotopic&#8208;glioma&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
A remaining challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surmounting the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Such a challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) nanoparticles are developed via rational design, which involves twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation&#8208;mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550&#160;nm and non&#8208;radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR&#8208;PTT). The brain&#8208;targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550&#160;nm band&#8208;pass filter is utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of the nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcomes previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that the ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Collectively, the work highlights the smart design of a brain&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE theranostic approach that opens new diagnosis and treatment options in the photonic therapy of GBM.

Hetero&#8208;MXenes
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications. In article number 2108809, Li Song and co&#8208;workers successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX via an optimal in situ hydrothermal strategy. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and an optimized Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, with improved charge transport and Li+&#8208;adsorption capabilities.

Interfacial Atomic Configurations
In article number 2106814, Kaihui Liu, Xin&#8208;Zheng Li, Xinqiang Wang, and co&#8208;workers profile a novel perspective of the lattice arrangement (polarity) manipulation of a quasi&#8208;van der Waals epitaxial hexagonal III&#8208;nitride film on graphene by interfacial atomic configuration engineering. Through using atomic O preirradiation and a specific supply sequence of Ga and N atoms to form the C&#8211;O&#8211;N&#8211;Ga(3) and C&#8211;O&#8211;Ga&#8211;N(3) configurations, N&#8208; and Ga&#8208;lattice polarity GaN films are achieved on transferred graphene, respectively.

Single&#8208;Core Double Emulsions
The fabrication of single&#8208;core double emulsions typically requires sophisticated microfluidic devices and meticulous operation protocols. In article number 2107338, Nicolas Vogel and co&#8208;workers develop a convenient method to produce such tailored double emulsions with defined droplet structure using only vortex mixing. This fast, low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;yield method improves the accessibility of droplet&#8208;based materials.

2D Photoconductivity
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressures can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. In article number 2107650, utilizing a surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction, Junwoo Son and co&#8208;workers report that ultraviolet&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of a perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially confined and optically programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.

         <title>Advanced Multifunctional Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries Design: From Materials and Devices to Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) can provide additional functions to realize unprecedented applications where conventional batteries normally fail. This review describes the recent advances of MARBs in terms of materials engineering, device design, system integration, and applications. The challenges and opportunities for further developments in the emerging field of MARBs are deeply discussed.








Abstract
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) are regarded as safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable electrochemical energy storage devices, which offer additional functionalities that conventional batteries cannot achieve, which ideally leads to unprecedented applications. Although MARBs are among the most exciting and rapidly growing topics in scientific research and industrial development nowadays, a systematic summary of the evolution and advances in the field of MARBs is still not available. Therefore, the review presented comprehensively and systematically summarizes the design principles and the recent advances of MARBs by categories of smart ARBs and integrated systems, together with an analysis of their device design and configuration, electrochemical performance, and diverse smart functions. The two most promising strategies to construct novel MARBs may be A) the introduction of functional materials into ARB components, and B) integration of ARBs with other functional devices. The ongoing challenges and future perspectives in this research and development field are outlined to foster the future development of MARBs. Finally, the most important upcoming research directions in this rapidly developing field are highlighted that may be most promising to lead to the commercialization of MARBs and to a further broadening of their range of applications.

Abstract
Anisotropy is the characteristic of a material to exhibit variations in its mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical properties, etc. along different directions. Anisotropic materials have attracted great research interest because of their wide applications in aerospace, sensing, soft robotics, and tissue engineering. 3D printing provides exceptional advantages in achieving controlled compositions and complex architecture, thereby enabling the manufacture of 3D objects with anisotropic functionalities. Here, a comprehensive review of the recent progress on 3D printing of anisotropic polymer materials based on different techniques including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination is presented. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies implemented in manipulating anisotropic structures are highlighted with the discussion of material categories, functionalities, and potential applications. This review is concluded with analyzing the current challenges and providing perspectives for further development in this field.

Anisotropic materials have attracted great research interest because of their wide applications in aerospace, sensing, soft robotics, and tissue engineering. 3D printing provides exceptional advantages in achieving controlled compositions and complex architecture, thereby enabling the manufacture of 3D objects with anisotropic functionalities. Here, a comprehensive review of the recent progress on 3D printing of anisotropic polymer materials based on different techniques including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination is presented. The state-of-the-art strategies implemented in manipulating anisotropic structures are highlighted with the discussion of material categories, functionalities, and potential applications. This review is concluded with analyzing the current challenges and providing perspectives for further development in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This review analyzes the key factors that hinder the reversible conversion of conversion&#8208;type materials, provides a fundamental understanding of graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs), and provides guidance on the bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs to be used in high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation batteries, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G&#8208;ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G&#8208;ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion&#8208;type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMC materials for next&#8208;generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.

         <title>Advanced High&#8208;Entropy Fluorophosphate Cathode for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>

Abstract
Impossible voltage plateau regulation for the cathode materials with fixed active elemental center is a pressing issue hindering the development of Na&#8208;super&#8208;ionic conductor (NASICON) type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we pioneeringly utilize high&#8208;entropy substitution strategy, to alter detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing central active V atom, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. As&#8208;prepared carbon&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE&#8208;NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81&#160;V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1, which is attributed by the diverse transition metal elemental substitution in high&#8208;entropy crystalline. More importantly, high&#8208;entropy introducing can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low&#8208;voltage region, further lifting up mean working voltage to realize a full Na ions storage at high voltage plateau. Coupling with hard carbon (HC) anode, HE&#8208;NVPF//HC SIBs full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 at 5C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg&#8211;1. This route let the unlikely potential regulation in NASICON&#8208;type crystal with unchangeable active center becomes possible, inspiring new ideas on elevating mean working voltage for SIBs cathodes.

         <title>Alternate Storage of Opposite Charges in Multisite for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Al&#8210;MOF Battery</title>

Abstract
The limited active sites of cathode materials in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) restrict the storage of more large&#8208;sized Al&#8208;complex ions, leading to a low celling of theoretical capacity. To make the utmost of active sites, we herein propose an alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges (AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations) in multisites to achieve an ultrahigh capacity in Al&#8210;MOF battery. The bipolar ligands (oxidized from 18&#960; to 16&#960; electrons and reduced from 18&#960; to 20&#960; electrons in a planar cyclic conjugated system) can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which can double the capacity of unipolar ligands. Moreover, the high&#8208;density active Cu sites (Cu nodes) in 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF could also store AlCl2+ cations for a higher capacity. The rigid and extended MOF structure can address the problems of high solubility and poor stability of small organic molecules. As a result, three&#8208;step redox reactions with two&#8208;electron transfer in each step are demonstrated in charge/discharge processes, achieving high reversible capacity (184 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (177&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) of the optimized cathode in Al&#8210;MOF battery. Our findings provide a new insight for rational design of stable high&#8208;energy Al&#8211;MOF batteries.

         <title>Plasmonic Active &#8220;Hot Spots&#8221;&#8208;Confined Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity for CH4 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures have tremendous potential to be applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, since their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can collect low&#8208;energy&#8208;photons to derive energetic &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; for reducing the CO2 activation&#8208;barrier. However, the hot electron&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is usually limited by poor efficiency and low selectivity for producing kinetically unfavourable hydrocarbons. Here, we propose a new idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalysis to overcome this drawback. We assemble W18O49 nanowires on the outer surface of Au nanoparticles&#8208;embedded TiO2 electrospun nanofibers to obtain lots of Au/TiO2/W18O49 sandwich&#8208;like sub&#8208;structures in the formed plasmonic heterostructure. The short distance (&lt; 10&#160;nm) between Au and adjacent W18O49 can induce an intense plasmon&#8208;coupling to form the active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the sub&#8208;structures. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; are capable of not only gathering the incident light to enhance &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; generation and migration, but also capturing protons and CO through the dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;active&#8208;sites (Au&#8208;O&#8208;Ti and W&#8208;O&#8208;Ti) at the Au/TiO2/W18O49 interface, as evidenced by systematic experiments and simulation analyses. Thus, during photocatalytic CO2 reduction at 43&#177; 2&#8451;,&#160;these active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; enriched in the well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure could synergistically confine the hot&#8208;electron, proton, and CO intermediates for resulting in the CH4 and CO production&#8208;rates at &#8764;35.55 and &#8764;2.57&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, and the CH4&#8208;product selectivity at &#8764;93.3%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasmonic nanostructures have tremendous potential to be applied in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, since their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can collect low-energy-photons to derive energetic &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; for reducing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation-barrier. However, the hot electron-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction is usually limited by poor efficiency and low selectivity for producing kinetically unfavourable hydrocarbons. Here, we propose a new idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;-confined photocatalysis to overcome this drawback. We assemble W&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;49&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires on the outer surface of Au nanoparticles-embedded TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrospun nanofibers to obtain lots of Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/W&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;49&lt;/sub&gt; sandwich-like sub-structures in the formed plasmonic heterostructure. The short distance (&amp;lt; 10&#160;nm) between Au and adjacent W&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;49&lt;/sub&gt; can induce an intense plasmon-coupling to form the active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the sub-structures. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; are capable of not only gathering the incident light to enhance &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; generation and migration, but also capturing protons and CO through the dual-hetero-active-sites (Au-O-Ti and W-O-Ti) at the Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/W&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;49&lt;/sub&gt; interface, as evidenced by systematic experiments and simulation analyses. Thus, during photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction at 43&#177; 2&#8451;,&#160;these active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; enriched in the well-designed Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/W&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;49&lt;/sub&gt; plasmonic heterostructure could synergistically confine the hot-electron, proton, and CO intermediates for resulting in the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO production-rates at &#8764;35.55 and &#8764;2.57&#160;&#956;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-product selectivity at &#8764;93.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interpretation of Rubidium&#8208;based Perovskite Recipes towards Electronic Passivation and Ion Diffusion Mitigation</title>

Abstract
Rubidium cation (Rb+) addition has been witnessed to play a pivotal role in boosting the comprehensive performance of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, the origin of such success derived from irreplaceable superiorities brought by Rb+ remains ambiguous. Herein, grain boundary&#8208;included atomic models, for the first time, have been adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb+ distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution covering both grain interiors and boundaries has been thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron&#8208;based grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior have been expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb+ addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability has been elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb+ concentration on electronic defect, ion migration and phase stability are completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high&#8208;efficiency cascade incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Artificial Hybrid Nanocells for Boosted Vascular Regeneration in Ischemic Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Restoration of sufficient blood supply for the treatment of ischemia remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Here, we introduce a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery technology that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions for the spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration. Specifically, a copper&#8208;containing protein was successfully prepared using a recombinant protein scaffold based on a de novo design strategy, which facilitated the timely release of nitric oxide (NO) and improved accumulation of particles within ischemic tissues. Through closely mimicking physiological cues, we demonstrated the benefits of bioactive factors secreted from hypoxic stem cells on promoting angiogenesis. Following this cell&#8208;mimicking manner, artificial hybrid nano&#8208;sized cells (Hynocell) were constructed by integrating the hypoxic stem cell secretome into nanoparticles with surface coatings of cell membranes fused with copper&#8208;containing protein. The Hynocell, hybridized with different cell&#8208;derived components, provided synergistic effects on targeting ischemic tissues and promoting vascular regeneration in acute hindlimb ischemia and acute myocardial infarction models. This study offers new insights into the utilization of nanotechnology to potentiate the development of cell&#8208;free therapeutics.

         <title>Artificial Heterogeneous Interphase Layer with Boosted Ion Affinity and Diffusion for Na/K Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic Na (K) is considered a promising anode material for Na (K) metal batteries because of its high theoretical capacity, low electrode potential, and abundant resources. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, we introduce a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K). Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that a heterogeneous Na2S/V (K2S/V) protective layer can effectively improve Na (K)&#8208;ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics, inhibiting the growth of Na (K) dendrites during Na (K) plating/stripping. Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na2S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, and the K2S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na3V2(PO4)3||Na2S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 and a high power density of 23.5&#160;kW kg&#8211;1. Our achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Unconventional Doping Effect Leads to Ultrahigh Average Thermoelectric Power Factor in Cu3SbSe4&#8208;based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric materials are typically highly degenerate semiconductors, which require high carrier concentration. However, the efficiency of conventional doping by replacing host atoms with alien ones is restricted by solubility limit, and more unfavorably, such doping method is likely to cause strong charge carrier scattering at ambient temperature, leading to deteriorated electrical performance. Here, we propose an unconventional doping strategy by using a small trace of alien atoms to stabilize cation vacancies in Cu3SbSe4 by compositing with CuAlSe2, in which cation vacancies rather than alien atoms provide high density of holes. Consequently, the hole concentration enlarges by 6 times but the carrier mobility is well maintained. As a result, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19 &#956;W cm&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 in the temperature range of 300&#8764;723 K is attained. Finally, with further reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a peak zT value of 1.4 and a record&#8208;high average zT value of 0.72 are achieved within the diamond&#8208;like compounds. Our new doping strategy not only can be applied for boosting the average power factor for thermoelectrics, but more generally can be used to maintain carrier mobility for a variety of semiconductors that need high carrier concentration.

         <title>Organic Single Crystal Actuators and Waveguides that Operate at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Applications in extreme conditions, such as those encountered in space exploration, require lightweight materials that can retain their elasticity in extremely cold environments. However, cryogenic treatment of most soft polymeric and elastomeric materials results in complete loss of their ability for elastic flow, whereby such materials that are normally ductile become stiff, brittle and prone to cracking. Here we report a facile method for preparation of hybrid organic crystalline materials that are not only cryogenically robust, but are also capable of large, recoverable and reversible deformation at low temperatures. To that end, flexible organic crystals were first mechanically reinforced by polymer coating and combined with a thermally responsive polymer. The resulting hybrid materials respond linearly and reversibly to temperatures from &#8722;15&#176;C to &#8722;120&#176;C without fatigue in air as well as in cold vacuum. The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that is inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost&#8208;effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low&#8208;temperature environmental settings.

         <title>A Redox Couple Strategy Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes by Suppressing Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The poor cycling stability and fast voltage fading resulting from oxygen release during charging, however, severely hinder their practical application. Herein, a strategy of introducing an additional redox couple is first proposed to eliminate the persistent problem of oxygen release. As a proof of concept, the cycling stability of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, which is a typical LMRO cathode, is substantially enhanced with the help of the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple, and the capacity shows no decay with a retention of 100% after 700 cycles at 1C, far superior to the bare counterpart (61.7%). The surface peroxide ions (O22&#8722;) are readily chemically reduced back to immobile O2&#8722; by S2&#8722; during charging, accompanied by the formation of SO32&#8722;, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the oxygen lattice and eventually inhibiting the release of oxygen. More importantly, the S2&#8722; ions are regenerated during the following discharging process and participate in the chemical redox reaction again. Our findings shed light on a potential direction to tackle the poor cycling stability of high&#8208;energy anion&#8208;redox cathode materials for rechargeable metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Heterojunction Annealing Enabling Record Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage in Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) thin&#8208;film solar cell has undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit still remains to be the biggest bottleneck as even the world record device suffers from a large VOC deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) was subjected to a post&#8208;annealing treatment using rapid thermal process. It was found that non&#8208;radiative recombination near the Sb2Se3/CdS HTJ including interface recombination and space charge region recombination were greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb2Se3/CdS thin&#8208;film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record VOC of 0.52&#160;V has been successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated VOC deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;Block Metals in Water Electrolysis: Status Quo and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Transition metals, in particular noble metals, are the most common species in metal&#8208;mediated water electrolysis because they serve as highly active catalytic sites. In many cases, the presence of non&#8208;transition metals, that is, s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals with high natural abundance in the earth&#8208;crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline&#8208;earth metals, rare&#8208;earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these non&#8208;transition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments towards a knowledge&#8208;based catalyst design. In this review, we discuss five classes of non&#8208;transition metals species which were successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure&#8208;catalytic activity relationships and phase stability. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field have also been addressed in this account. We anticipate that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals species towards the discovery of advanced polymetal&#8208;containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stretchable and fast self&#8208;healing ionic hydrogel in cryogenic environments for artificial nerve fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials behave irreplaceable advantages in biomimetic intelligent robots (BIR) for avoiding or reducing safety hazards and economic losses from accidental damage during service. However, the self&#8208;healing ability is unreservedly lost and even becomes rigid, fragile in the cryogenic environment where BIR is precisely needed. Here, we report a versatile ionic hydrogel with fast self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and stable conductivity, even at &#8208;80&#8451;. The hydrogel is systematically optimized to improve hydrogen&#8208;bonded network nanostructure, coordinated achieving a quick self&#8208;healing ability within 10&#160;min, large deformation tolerance of over 7000%, superior conductivity of 11.76 S&#183;cm&#8211;1 and anti&#8208;freezing ability, which is difficult to obtain simultaneously. Such hydrogel provides new opportunities for artificial electronic devices in harsh environments. As a prospective application, we fabricate an artificial nerve fiber by mimicking the structure and functions of the myelinated axon, exhibiting the property of fast and potential&#8208;gated signal transmission. This artificial nerve fiber is integrated into a robot for demonstrating a real&#8208;time high fidelity and high throughput information interaction under big deformation and cryogenic temperature. The hydrogel and bionic device will bring pioneering functions for robots and open a broad application scenario in extreme conditions.
