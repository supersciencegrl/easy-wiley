         <title>Materials Engineering for Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in material and architecture engineering of air&#8208;water&#8208;harvesting materials have promoted remarkable progress toward the atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology. This perspective discusses the fundamental insights of how different material designs affect the water&#8208;material interactions in advancing AWH technology.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is emerging as a promising strategy to produce fresh water from abundant airborne moisture to overcome the global clean water shortage. The ubiquitous moisture resources allow AWH to be free from geographical restrictions and potentially realize decentralized applications, making it a vital parallel or supplementary freshwater production approach to liquid water resource&#8208;based technologies. Recent advances in regulating chemical properties and micro/nanostructures of moisture&#8208;harvesting materials have demonstrated new possibilities to promote enhanced device performance and new understandings. This perspective aims to provide a timely overview on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials design and how they serve as the active components in AWH. First, the key processes of AWH, including vapor condensation, droplet nucleation, growth, and departure are outlined, and the desired material properties based on the fundamental mechanisms are discussed. Then, how tailoring materials&#8208;water interactions at the molecular level play a vital role in realizing high water uptake and low energy consumption is shown. Last, the challenges and outlook on further improving AWH from material designs and system engineering aspects are highlighted.

         <title>3D Microvascularized Tissue Models by Laser&#8208;Based Cavitation Molding of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel method to generate channels in collagen hydrogels with sub&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m resolution using non&#8208;ablative cavitation&#8208;based laser patterning. These channels can be used for the direct seeding of endothelial cells to form an artificial microvasculature. Cavitation&#8208;based patterning preserves the viability of cells in the hydrogels arranged either as single cells or spheroids, enabling complex microvascularized tissue models.








Abstract
3D tissue models recapitulating human physiology are important for fundamental biomedical research, and they hold promise to become a new tool in drug development. An integrated and defined microvasculature in 3D tissue models is necessary for optimal cell functions. However, conventional bioprinting only allows the fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds containing vessel&#8208;like structures with large diameters (&gt;100&#160;&#181;m) and simple geometries. Recent developments in laser photoablation enable the generation of this type of structure with higher resolution and complexity, but the photo&#8208;thermal process can compromise cell viability and hydrogel integrity. To address these limitations, the present work reports in situ 3D patterning of collagen hydrogels by femtosecond laser irradiation to create channels and cavities with diameters ranging from 20 to 60&#160;&#181;m. In this process, laser irradiation of the hydrogel generates cavitation gas bubbles that rearrange the collagen fibers, thereby creating stable microchannels. Such 3D channels can be formed in cell&#8208; and organoid&#8208;laden hydrogel without affecting the viability outside the lumen and can enable the formation of artificial microvasculature by the culture of endothelial cells and cell media perfusion. Thus, this method enables organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and 3D tissue models featuring complex microvasculature.

         <title>Multiple Responsive CPL Switches in an Enantiomeric Pair of Perovskite Confined in Lanthanide MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are embedded in homochiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) without any ligand passivation. Experimental results indicate that MAPbBr3 NCs adopted a chiral packing in enantiomeric MOFs by Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O bonds. The CPL of composites possesses the multiple external&#8208;stimulate responsive reversibility. 








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches have attracted widespread attention due to their potential applications in advanced information technologies. However, the design and fabrication of solid&#8208;state multiple&#8208;responsive CPL switches remain challenging. Here, through self&#8208;assembly of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), a pair of crystalline enantiomeric (P)&#8208;(+)/(M)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;EuMOF&#8835;MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;) adducts is prepared, where the achiral MAPbBr3 perovskite NCs embedded into chiral MOFs inherit the chirality of host MOFs by host&#8208;guest Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O coordination bonds, which is demonstrated by synchrotron&#8208;radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The chiral adducts show enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), good thermal stability of CPL in air, and photoswitchable CPL properties upon altering different UV irradiation. Based on two chiral emission centers and their different characteristics, reversible CPL switches are realized upon a diversity of external stimuli, for example, chemicals (water /CH3NH3Br solution) or temperatures (room temperature/high temperature). Benefiting from the extraordinary stimuli&#8208;responsive and highly reversible switchable CPL, multiple information encryptions and decryptions integrated with CPL, together with a chiroptical logic gate are successfully designed. This work opens a new avenue to generally fabricate solid&#8208;state CPL composite materials and develops new applications based on switchable CPL.

         <title>Doping Control of Magnetic Anisotropy for Stable Antiskyrmion Formation in Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. It is demonstrated that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy, and subtle balance between uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, vortex&#8208;like topological spin textures, have attracted much interest in a wide range of research fields from fundamental physics to spintronics applications. Recently, growing attention is also paid to antiskyrmions emerging with opposite topological charge in non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnets with D2d or S4 symmetry. In these magnets, complex interplay among anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic dipolar interactions generates various magnetic textures. However, the precise role of these magnetic interactions in stabilizing antiskyrmions remains to be elucidated. In this work, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. The authors&#8217; magnetometry study, supported by ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, shows that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy. In particular, doping with Pd induces easy&#8208;axis anisotropy, giving rise to formation of antiskyrmions, while a temperature&#8208;induced spin reorientation is observed in an Rh&#8208;doped compound. In combination with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, the stability of antiskyrmion as functions of uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is quantitatively analyzed, and demonstrated that subtle balance between them is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.

Through changing mixed stacking into segregated stacking mode, triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex demonstrates a low CT degree and a small counter pitch angle between TP and F4TCNQ molecules, benefiting for breaking the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state for realizing the near&#8208;infrared emission with a maximum peak of 770 nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 5.4%.








Abstract
Harvesting the narrow bandgap excitons of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes for the achievement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission has attracted intensive attention for its fundamental importance and practical application. Herein, the triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) CT organic complex is designed and fabricated via the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process, which demonstrates the NIR emission with a maximum peak of 770&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.4%. The segregated stacking mode of TP&#8208;F4TCNQ CT complex based on the multiple types of intermolecular interaction has a low CT degree of 0.00103 and a small counter pitch angle of 40&#176; between F4TCNQ and TP molecules, which breaks the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state, resulting in the effective NIR emission. Acting as the promising candidates for the active optical waveguide in the NIR region beyond 760&#160;nm, the self&#8208;assembled TP&#8208;F4TCNQ single&#8208;crystalline organic microwires display an ultralow optical&#8208;loss coefficient of 0.060&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. This work holds considerable insights for the exploration of novel NIR&#8208;emissive organic materials via an universal &#8220;cocrystal engineering&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Constructing Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cell with Efficiency of 22.0% via Reduced Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss and Broadened Absorption Spectra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing ClFA+ cation to reduce the voltage loss of perovskite front subcell and using chloride substitution to broaden the absorption spectra of organic rear subcell, a monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell is constructed, and the power conversion efficiency reaches 22.0%.








Abstract
Combining the high stability under UV light of the wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) and the broad near&#8208;infrared absorption spectra of the narrow bandgap (NBG) organic solar cells (OSCs), the perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as front cell and the NBG OSC as rear cell have attracted attention . However, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite/organic TSCs needs to be further improved. Herein, nonradiative charge recombination loss is reduced through bulk defect passivation in the WBG pero&#8208;SC front subcell and broadening the range of absorption spectra of the NBG OSC rear cell. For the WBG pero&#8208;SCs, an organic cation chloro&#8208;formamidinium is introduced into FA0.6MA0.4Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 to passivate the bulk defects in the perovskite film and the WBG pero&#8208;SC displays high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and high fill factor of 83.0%. For the NBG OSCs, a new infrared&#8208;absorbing organic small molecule acceptor BTPV&#8208;4Cl&#8208;eC9 is designed and synthesized. Then, a monolithic perovskite/organic TSC is fabricated with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as the front cell and the NBG OSC as the rear cell, and the TSC demonstrates high power conversion efficiency up to 22.0%. The results indicate that the perovskite/organic TSC is promising for future commercialization.

Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices.

Abstract
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. In this letter, the gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al nanowires is studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field. Both uniform hybrid nanowires and devices featuring a short Josephson junction fabricated by shadow lithography, exhibit periodic modulation of the switching current. The period corresponds to a flux quantum through the nanowire diameter and is consistent with Andreev bound states occupying a cylindrical surface accumulation layer. The spatial distribution is tunable by a gate potential as expected from electrostatic models.

         <title>Vertical Extrusion Cryo(bio)printing for Anisotropic Tissue Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting technique is reported, which concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. This method is further extended to a multimaterial format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.








Abstract
Due to the poor mechanical properties of many hydrogel bioinks, conventional 3D extrusion bioprinting is usually conducted based on the X&#8211;Y plane, where the deposited layers are stacked in the Z&#8208;direction with or without the support of prior layers. Herein, a technique is reported, taking advantage of a cryoprotective bioink to enable direct extrusion bioprinting in the vertical direction in the presence of cells, using a freezing plate with precise temperature control. Of interest, vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. Skeletal myoblasts within the 3D&#8208;cryo&#8208;bioprinted hydrogel constructs show enhanced cell viability, spreading, and alignment, compared to the same cells in the standard hydrogel constructs. This method is further extended to a multimaterial format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, such as creation of the muscle&#8211;tendon unit and the muscle&#8211;microvascular unit. The unique vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting technique presented here suggests improvements in robustness and versatility to engineer certain tissue types especially those anisotropic in nature, and may extend broad utilities in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Growing a Tenacious Hydrogel Coating from a Sticky Initiation Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative modification method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization from a sticky initiation layer, based on in situ interface redox mechanism, is proposed for mildly/controllably growing hydrogel coatings on practically any substrate's (natural or artificial materials)/medical device's surface regardless of surface topology and material category.








Abstract
Controllably coating the surfaces of substrates/medical devices with hydrogels exhibits great application potential, but lacks universal techniques. Herein, a new method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization (UV&#8208;SCIRP) from a sticky initiation layer (SIL) (SIL@UV&#8208;SCIRP), is proposed for growing hydrogel coatings. The method involves three key steps: 1) depositing a sticky polydopamine/Fe3+ coating on the surface of the substrates&#8208;SIL, 2) reducing Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions as active catalysts by UV illumination with the assistance of citric acid, and 3) conducting SCIRP in a monomer solution at room temperature for growing hydrogel coatings. In this manner, practically any substrate's surface (natural or artificial materials) can be modified by hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness and diverse compositions. The hydrogel coatings exhibit good interface bonding with the substrates and enable easy changes in their wettability and lubrication performances. Importantly, this novel method facilitates the smooth growth of uniform hydrogel lubrication coatings on the surface of a range of medical devices with complex geometries. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the slippery balls coated with hydrogel exhibited smooth movement within the catheter and esophagus. Hence, this method can prove to be a pioneering universal modification tool, especially in surface/interface science and engineering.

     alt="A Universal Strategy for Growing a Tenacious Hydrogel Coating from a Sticky Initiation Layer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An innovative modification method, namely ultraviolet-triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization from a sticky initiation layer, based on in situ interface redox mechanism, is proposed for mildly/controllably growing hydrogel coatings on practically any substrate's (natural or artificial materials)/medical device's surface regardless of surface topology and material category.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controllably coating the surfaces of substrates/medical devices with hydrogels exhibits great application potential, but lacks universal techniques. Herein, a new method, namely ultraviolet-triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization (UV-SCIRP) from a sticky initiation layer (SIL) (SIL@UV-SCIRP), is proposed for growing hydrogel coatings. The method involves three key steps: 1) depositing a sticky polydopamine/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; coating on the surface of the substrates-SIL, 2) reducing Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions as active catalysts by UV illumination with the assistance of citric acid, and 3) conducting SCIRP in a monomer solution at room temperature for growing hydrogel coatings. In this manner, practically any substrate's surface (natural or artificial materials) can be modified by hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness and diverse compositions. The hydrogel coatings exhibit good interface bonding with the substrates and enable easy changes in their wettability and lubrication performances. Importantly, this novel method facilitates the smooth growth of uniform hydrogel lubrication coatings on the surface of a range of medical devices with complex geometries. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, the slippery balls coated with hydrogel exhibited smooth movement within the catheter and esophagus. Hence, this method can prove to be a pioneering universal modification tool, especially in surface/interface science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Polarizability Organic Ferroelectric Materials Doping for Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric field of Perovskite Solar Cells Realizing Efficiency over 24%</title>

Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) intensity of silicon heterojunction solar cells can be easily enhanced by selective doping to obtain high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), while it has been challenging for perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Herein, we report an effective method to enhance the BEF of FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite by doping an organic ferroelectric material, polyvinylidene fluoride:dabcoHReO4 (PVDF:DH) with high polarizability, that can be driven even by the BEF of the device itself. The polarization of PVDF:DH produces an additional electric field, which is maintained permanently and in a direction consistent with that of the BEF of the pero&#8208;SC. The BEF superposition&#160;can more sufficiently drive the charge&#8208;carrier transport and extraction, thus suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination occurring in the pero&#8208;SCs. Moreover, the PVDF:DH dopant benefits the formation of a mesoporous PbI2 film, via a typical two&#8208;step processing method, thereby promoting perovskite growth with a high crystallinity and few defects. The resulting pero&#8208;SC shows a promising PCE of 24.23% for a 0.062&#8208;cm2 device (certified PCE of 23.45%), and a remarkable PCE of 22.69% for a 1&#8208;cm2 device, along with significantly improved moisture resistances and operational stabilities.

         <title>Anti&#8208;freezing Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ternary Hydrogen Bonding for High Performance zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
The new generation flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries require enhanced mechanical property and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications. This fundamentally desires the hydrogel electrolyte to possess anti&#8208;freezing merits to resist the flexibility loss and performance decreasing at subzero temperatures. Herein, a highly flexible polysaccharide hydrogel is in&#8208;situ realized and regulated in zinc&#8208;ion batteries through the Hofmeister effect with the low concentration Zn(ClO4)2 salts to satisfy the abovementioned requirements. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions, water and polymer chains can form ternary and weak hydrogen bonding (HB), which enables the polymer chains with improved mechanical properties, breaks the HB of water to remarkably decrease the electrolyte freezing point, and reduces the amounts of free water for effectively side reaction and dendrite inhibiting. Consequently, even at &#8208;30&#160;&#176;C, the Zn(ClO4)2 in&#8208;situ optimized hydrogel electrolyte features a high ionic conductivity of 7.8 mS cm&#8722;1 and excellent flexibility, which enables the Zn/PANI battery with a reversible capacity of 70&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 under 5 A g&#8722;1 for 2500 cycles, and renders the flexible full battery with excellent cycling performances under different bending angles. This work provides a new pathway for designing high performance anti&#8208;freezing flexible batteries via the Hofmeister effect.

         <title>Urine Microenvironment&#8208;Initiated Composite Hydrogel Patch Reconfiguration Propels Scarless Memory Repair and Reinvigoration of Urethra</title>

Abstract
Harsh urine microenvironment (UME) as an inherent hurdle endangers and renders urethral repair unreachable. Innovatively, we utilized the unfavorable UME as the design source to construct a UME&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch for realizing scarless memory repair, wherein laser&#8208;excited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mechanical strength elevation using chemically&#8208;crosslinked silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) are accessible. Intriguingly, the proposed composite scaffolds can respond to Ca2+ in urine, cause structure reconfiguration, and repress swelling to further enhance scaffold stiffness. Systematic experiments validate that ROS birth and unexpected stiffness elevation in such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds can realize scarless memory repair of urethra in vivo. Comprehensive mechanism explorations uncover that the activations of cell proliferation and collagen&#8208;related genes (e.g., MMP&#8208;1 and COL3A1) and the dampening of fibrosis&#8208;related (e.g., TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) and mechanosensitive genes (e.g., YAP/TAZ) are responsible for the scarless memory repair of such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, decreasing fibrosis and inflammation and accelerating angiogenesis. The design rationales (e.g., UME&#8208;initiated structure reconfiguration and anti&#8208;swelling) can serve as an instructive and general approach for urethra repair.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polymer Nanoparticles for Efficient Delivery of Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein With or Without Donor DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). However, clinical transition of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, we report facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ&#8208;NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR&#8208;NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm). Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ&#8208;NP induced efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR&#8208;NP also led to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR-Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology-directed repair (HDR). However, clinical transition of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, we report facilely fabricated pH-responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ-NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR-NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm). Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ-NP induced efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR-NP also led to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ-NP and HDR-NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A New Strategy for Microbial Taxonomic Identification through Micro&#8208;Biosynthetic Gold Nanoparticles and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is developed for the identification of multiple classifications of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi, from kingdom to species. The features of gold nanoparticles biosynthesized by different microorganisms are analyzed by machine&#8208;learning algorithms. The levels of glucose, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#8208;dependent reductase are related to the underlying mechanism of micro&#8208;biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles.








Abstract
Microorganisms can serve as biological factories for the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials that can become useful as nanocatalysts, energy&#8208;harvesting&#8211;storage components, antibacterial agents, and biomedical materials. Herein, the development of biosynthesis of inorganic nanomaterials into a simple, stable, and accurate strategy for distinguishing microorganisms from multiple classification levels (i.e., kingdom, order, genus, and species) without gene amplification, biochemical testing, or target recognition is reported. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) biosynthesized by different microorganisms differ in color of the solution, and their features can be characterized, including the particle size, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrum, and the surface potential. The inter&#8208;relation between the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and the classification of microorganisms are exploited at different levels through machine learning to establish a taxonomic model. This model agrees well with traditional classification methods that offers a new strategy for microbial taxonomic identification. The underlying mechanism of this strategy is related to the biomolecules produced by different microorganisms including glucose, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#8208;dependent reductase that regulate the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs. This work broadens the application of biosynthesis of inorganic materials through micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and machine learning, which holds great promise as a tool for biomedical research.

         <title>Sulfuration of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Multianionic Redox and Stabilized Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurization of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs) can be achieved by ion&#8208;exchange reaction to incorporate sulfur atoms in the lattice structure of LLOs, while the surface polyanions&#8208;formation leads to the protecting layer. This facile and economical way to sulfurize LLO materials can provide multianionic redox and stabilized coordination environment thus for outstanding battery performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich transition metal oxides (LLOs) can deliver high specific capacity over 250 mAh g&#8722;1, stemming from additional contribution of oxygen redox. However, the formation of O(2&#8722;n)&#8722; (0 &lt; n&#160;&lt; 2) species and even oxygen gas during the deep oxidation stage leads to progressive structural transformation that cause voltage decay/hysteresis, sluggish kinetics, and poor thermostability, preventing real&#8208;world application of LLOs. Therefore, the substantive key relies on enhancing the anionic redox stability in LLOs. Here, a sulfuration procedure of LLOs (S&#8208;LLOs) is proposed, in which sulfur anions are incorporated into oxygen sites in the lattice structure and form polyanions on the surface. Proved by structural characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, sulfur anions in the interior lattice can reversibly participate in the redox process and enhance the integral coordination stability by mitigating undesired oxygen redox. Moreover, S polyanions at the surface form a protecting layer for interfacial stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that S&#8208;LLO demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 307.8 mAh g&#8722;1, an outstanding capacity retention rate of 91.5% after 200 cycles, along with excellent voltage maintenance, rate capability, and thermostability. The sulfuration process of LLOs with multianionic redox mechanism highlights a promising strategy to design novel high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials with superior cycling performance.

Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, including zinc&#8208;iodine redox flow batteries and static zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, are promising candidates for future grid&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage. They are safe with great theoretical capacity, high energy and power density. Nevertheless, to make aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries practically feasible, there are quite a few hurdles need to be overcome, including self&#8208;discharge, sluggish kinetics, low energy density, and instability of Zn metal anodes. This article first reviews the electrochemistry in aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, including the flow and static battery configurations and their electrode reactions. Then we discuss the fundamental questions of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries and highlight the key strategies and recent accomplishments in tackling the challenges. Last, we share our thoughts on the future research development in aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Strain Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures Triggered by a Spin&#8208;Crossover Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered spin&#8208;crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks are deterministically assembled with other 2D materials, such as graphene or WSe2, forming van der Waals heterostructures. The strain concomitant to the spin transition clearly switches the electrical and optical properties of the 2D material. Thus, spin&#8208;crossover van der Waals heterostructures represent a new route for band engineering in low&#8208;dimensional materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide the possibility of engineering new materials with emergent functionalities that are not accessible in another way.

&lt;p&gt;Layered spin-crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks are deterministically assembled with other 2D materials, such as graphene or WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, forming van der Waals heterostructures. The strain concomitant to the spin transition clearly switches the electrical and optical properties of the 2D material. Thus, spin-crossover van der Waals heterostructures represent a new route for band engineering in low-dimensional materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide the possibility of engineering new materials with emergent functionalities that are not accessible in another way. These heterostructures are formed by assembling layers of different materials used as building blocks. Beyond inorganic 2D crystals, layered molecular materials remain still rather unexplored, with only few examples regarding their isolation as atomically thin layers. Here, the family of van der Waals heterostructures is enlarged by introducing a molecular building block able to produce strain: the so-called spin-crossover (SCO).

In particular, smart vdWHs are prepared in which the electronic and optical properties of the 2D material (graphene and WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are clearly switched by the strain concomitant to the spin transition.

         <title>Electronic Properties and Carrier Dynamics at the Alloy Interfaces of WS2xSe2&#8722;2x Spiral Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2xSe2&#8722;2x spiral nanosheets demonstrate quadratically enhanced strong layer&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation effects. The atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images and scanning tunneling spectroscopy maps at the WS/WSe interfaces demonstrate electron scattering at the alloy interfaces at deeper energy levels, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes inferred from pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy measurements.








Abstract
Electronic properties at the interfaces between different&#8208;composition domains of 2D&#8208;alloys are key for their optical, electronic, and optoelectronic applications. Understanding the interfacial electronic structures and carrier dynamics is essential for designing and fabricating devices that use these alloys. Here, WS2xSe2&#8722;2x spiral nanosheets are prepared using the physical vapor deposition method, and the nonlinear optical and electronic properties, as well as the carrier dynamics at the interfaces between the WS and WSe domains, are studied. Second&#8208;harmonic generation tests demonstrate that these nanosheets exhibit a very strong layer&#8208;dependent nonlinear optical effect. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal that S and Se atoms are non&#8208;uniformly distributed, forming WS domains, WSe domains, and defect&#8208;related areas. Atomic STM images and STS maps reveal enhanced local density of states by electron scattering at the WS/WSe interfaces, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes observed in pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy measurements. This work provides valuable interfacial characterization of 2D&#8208;alloy materials, using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The obtained insights are likely to be useful for prospective applications.

         <title>Controlled Switching of the Number of Skyrmions in a Magnetic Nanodot by Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is realized, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is non&#8208;volatile and reversible. The results open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, non&#8208;volatile, and multi&#8208;bit skyrmionic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topological swirling spin configurations that hold promise for building future magnetic memories and logic circuits. Skyrmionic devices typically rely on the electrical manipulation of a single skyrmion, but controllably manipulating a group of skyrmions can lead to more compact and memory&#8208;efficient devices. Here, an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is reported, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is non&#8208;volatile and reversible, which is crucial for multi&#8208;bit memory applications. Combined experiments and theoretical simulations reveal that the switching of skyrmion clusters is induced by the strain&#8208;mediated modification of both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and effective uniaxial anisotropy. The results not only open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, non&#8208;volatile, and multi&#8208;bit skyrmionic devices, but also offer valuable insights into the fundamental physics underlying the voltage manipulation of skyrmion clusters.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Pathway Model for the Evolution of Colloidal Compound Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;pathway model has been proposed for the evolution of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). One unique intermediate called &#8220;precursor compound&#8221; (PC) is discovered to transform to its magic&#8208;size cluster (MSC) counterpart via intramolecular reorganization. PCs can be engineered to selectively produce either ultrasmall QDs with enhanced particle yield or various MSCs, with an unprecedented high degree of control.








Abstract
A fundamental understanding of formation pathways is critical to the controlled synthesis of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. As ultrasmall&#8208;size quantum dots (QDs) sometimes emerge in reactions along with magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs), distinguishing their individual pathway of evolution is important, but has proven difficult. To decouple the evolution of QDs and MSCs, an unconventional, selective approach has been developed, along with a two&#8208;pathway model that provides a fundamental understanding of production selectivity. For on&#8208;demand production of either ultrasmall QDs or MSCs, the key enabler is in how to allow a reaction to proceed in the time prior to nucleation and growth of QDs. In this prenucleation stage, an intermediate compound forms, which is the precursor compound (PC) to the MSC. Here, the two&#8208;pathway model and the manipulation of such PCs to synthesize either ultrasmall QDs or binary and ternary MSCs are highlighted. The two&#8208;pathway model will assist the development of nucleation theory as well as provide a basis for a mechanism&#8208;enabled design and predictive synthesis of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;Functionalized Conductive Polymer Hydrogels for Electromagnetic&#8208;Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for 3D printing to precisely create 3D architectures with high design freedom and a post&#8208;printing freeze&#8211;thawing treatment protocol is proposed to transform the as&#8208;printed objects into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale, enabling customizable applications.








Abstract
The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI&#8208;shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI)-shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI-shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MXene-functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze&#8211;thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro- and microscale. The as-obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI-shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed easy-to-manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Nanofilm Electrode Arrays for Long&#8208;Term Stable Neural Interfacings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes are developed. The NEAs are encapsulated into biodissolvable polymer carriers through an efficient elastocapillary self&#8208;assembly process, enabling their reliable implantation into deep brain tissues. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months.








Abstract
Flexible neural electrodes integrated on micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates offer important opportunities for improving the stability of neuronal activity recordings during cognitive processes. However, the bending stiffness of micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates is typically two orders of magnitude higher than that of nanofilm electrodes, making it a limiting factor in electrode&#8208;tissue interfacings. Here, this limitation is overcome by developing self&#8208;assembled nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months. As an application example, the activities of the same neuronal populations are tracked across odor discrimination reversal learning and it is illustrated how dorsal striatal neurons represent and update stimulus&#8208;outcome associations across multiple timescales. The results underscore the potential of free&#8208;standing nanoscale materials for interfacing biological systems over long terms.

         <title>Soluble Organic Cathodes Enable Long Cycle Life, High Rate, and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic cathodes are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life, excellent rate capability, and a wide operation temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on bi&#8208;functional gel polymer electrolytes, which can eliminate the shuttling of the soluble organic electrode materials through molecular sieving and charge repulsion while maintaining a fast reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials free of rare transition metal elements are promising for sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign battery chemistries. However, severe shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of active materials in liquid electrolytes results in fast capacity decay, limiting their practical applications. Here, using a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) that is in situ formed on Nafion&#8208;coated separators, the shuttle reaction of organic electrodes is eliminated while maintaining the electrochemical performance. The synergy of physical confinement by GPE with tunable polymer structure and charge repulsion of the Nafion&#8208;coated separator substantially prevents the soluble organic electrode materials with different molecular sizes from shuttling. A soluble small&#8208;molecule organic electrode material of 1,3,5&#8208;tri(9,10&#8208;anthraquinonyl)benzene demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 10&#8239;000 cycles, excellent rate capability of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C, and a wide working temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on the solid&#8211;liquid conversion chemistry, which outperforms all previously reported organic cathode materials. The shielding capability of GPE can be designed and tailored toward organic electrodes with different molecular sizes, thus providing a universal resolution to the shuttling effect that all soluble electrode materials suffer.

         <title>Efficiency of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Sensitized Triplet Upconversion Doubled in Three&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the first three&#8208;component metal&#8208;free photon upconversion system on the upconversion efficiency and threshold light intensity is studied herein. While the efficiency is doubled, the threshold light intensity is also increased. The performance enhancement can be attributed to more efficient energy transfer from the sensitizer to the intermediate acceptor in combination with a high quantum yield emitter molecule.








Abstract
As in many fields, the most exciting endeavors in photon upconversion research focus on increasing the efficiency (upconversion quantum yield) and performance (anti&#8208;Stokes shift) while diminishing the cost of production. In this vein, studies employing metal&#8208;free thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers have garnered increased interest. Here, for the first time, the strategy of ternary photon upconversion is utilized with the TADF sensitizer 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN), resulting in a doubling of the upconversion quantum yield in comparison to the binary system employing p&#8208;terphenyl as the emitter. In this ternary blend, the sensitizer 4CzIPN is paired with an intermediate acceptor, 1&#8208;methylnaphthalene, in addition to the emitter molecule, p&#8208;terphenyl, yielding a normalized upconversion quantum yield of 7.6% while maintaining the 0.83&#160;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift. These results illustrate the potential benefits of utilizing this strategy of energy&#8208;funneling, previously used only with heavy&#8208;metal based sensitizers, to increase the performance of these photon upconversion systems.

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancement of piezoelectricity by external stimuli is advantageous for its simple and in situ control, and compatibility with other functionalities. In this work, light is shown to be a powerful control parameter to induce a sevenfold enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient in BiFeO3 single crystals due to the bulk photovoltaic and Schottky barrier effects, offering potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches are well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored, despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, it is shown that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of BiFeO3 single crystals. A series of measurements based on piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, under illumination, reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a sevenfold increase. This phenomenon is explained with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open&#8208;circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Sprayed Starvation/Chemodynamic Therapeutic Gel for Post&#8208;Surgical Treatment of IDH1 (R132H) Glioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>

A starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel of GOx@MnCaP@fibrin is developed for post&#8208;surgical treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma, through depleting intratumoral glucose and generating high levels of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Complete resection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma is unfeasible and the classic post&#8208;surgical chemo/radiotherapy suffers from high recurrence and low survival rate. IDH1 (R132H) cells are sensitive to low concentrations of glucose and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inherent metabolism reprograming. Hence, a starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel is developed to combat residual IDH1 (R132H) tumor cells after surgery. Briefly, glucose oxidase (GOx) is mineralized with manganese&#8208;doped calcium phosphate to form GOx@MnCaP nanoparticles, which are encapsulated into the fibrin gel (GOx@MnCaP@fibrin). After spraying gel in the surgical cavity, GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in residual IDH1 (R132H) cells and produces H2O2. The generated H2O2 is further converted into highly lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) by a Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction to further kill the residual IDH1 (R132H) cells. The as&#8208;prepared starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel shows much higher therapeutic efficacy toward IDH1 (R132H) cells than IDH1 (WT) cells, and achieves long&#8208;term survival.

         <title>Shielding Ferritin with a Biomineralized Shell Enables Efficient Modulation of Tumor Microenvironment and Targeted Delivery of Diverse Therapeutic Agents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible ferritin&#8208;based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which calcium phosphate is generated on the ferritin surface. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables efficient drug delivery to tumor and powerful tumor microenvironment modulation, but also brings additional functionalities by loading diverse drugs in the cavity and the shell for potent antitumor effects on multiple cell and patient&#8208;derived xenografts.








Abstract
Ferritin (Fn) is considered a promising carrier for targeted delivery to tumors, but the successful application in vivo has not been fully achieved yet. Herein, strong evidence is provided that the Fn receptor is expressed in liver tissues, resulting in an intercept effect in regards to tumor delivery. Building on these observations, a biomineralization technology is rationally designed to shield Fn using a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell, which can improve the delivery performance by reducing Fn interception in the liver while re&#8208;exposing it in acidic tumors. Moreover, the selective dissolution of the CaP shell not only neutralizes the acidic microenvironment but also induces the intratumoral immunomodulation and calcification. Upon multiple cell line and patient&#8208;derived xenografts, it is demonstrated that the elaboration of the highly flexible Fn@CaP chassis by loading a chemotherapeutic drug into the Fn cavity confers potent antitumor effects, and additionally encapsulating a photosensitizer into the outer shell enables a combined chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy for complete suppression of advanced tumors. Altogether, these results support Fn@CaP as a new nanoplatform for efficient modulation of the tumor microenvironment and targeted delivery of diverse therapeutic agents.

         <title>Immune Checkpoint Ligand Bioengineered Schwann Cells as Antigen&#8208;Specific Therapy for Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>

A translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 86&#8208;functionalized Schwann cells to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis is developed.








Abstract
Failure to establish immune tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune disease. The ability to regulate autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immunosuppression represents a major challenge in the development of new strategies to treat autoimmune disease. Here, a translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208; and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86)&#8208;functionalized mouse Schwann cells (SCs) to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis (MS) in established mouse models of chronic and relapsing&#8208;remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is described. It is shown that the intravenous (i.v.) administration of immune checkpoint ligand functionalized mouse SCs modifies the course of disease and ameliorates EAE. Further, it is found that such bioengineered mouse SCs inhibit the differentiation of myelin&#8208;specific helper T cells into pathogenic T helper type&#8208;1 (Th1) and type&#8208;17 (Th17) cells, promote the development of tolerogenic myelin&#8208;specific regulatory T (Treg) cells, and resolve inflammatory central nervous system microenvironments without inducing systemic immunosuppression.

         <title>Tuning the Transport Properties of Gases in Porous Graphene Membranes with Controlled Pore Size and Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;separation membranes based on porous graphene (PG) offer ultimate permeance; however, they show low selectivity. The pore&#8208;narrowing approach, via gold deposition onto PG, allows both the thickness and the pore size of the membrane to be tuned to obtain a high number of pores below 3&#160;nm, enabling increased gas&#8211;surface interactions and molecular sieving for high gas selectivity and permeance.








Abstract
Porous graphene membranes have emerged as promising alternatives for gas&#8208;separation applications due to their atomic thickness enabling ultrahigh permeance, but they suffer from low gas selectivity. Whereas decreasing the pore size below 3&#160;nm is expected to increase the gas selectivity due to molecular sieving, it is rather challenging to generate a large number of uniform small pores on the graphene surface. Here, a pore&#8208;narrowing approach via gold deposition onto porous graphene surface is introduced to tune the pore size and thickness of the membrane to achieve a large number of small pores. Through the systematic approach, the ideal combination is determined as pore size below 3&#160;nm, obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm, to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane shows a H2/CO2 separation factor of 31.3 at H2 permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 105 GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;10&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1), which is the highest value reported to date in the 105 GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, &#8722;5.3&#160;versus &#8722;21&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for H2 and CO2, respectively, increased surface&#8211;gas interactions and molecular&#8208;sieving effect with decreasing pore size.

         <title>A Super&#8208;Boosted Hybrid Plasmonic Upconversion Process for Photodetection at 1550&#160;nm Wavelength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film. The plasmonic effect, super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, by MLA leads to superior sensitivity and responsivity of devices at weak near&#8208;infrared excitation powers.








Abstract
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Plasmonic metasurfaces and Au core&#8211;satellite nanoassembly (CSNA) films can strongly induce a more effective plasmonic effect by providing numerous hot spots in an intense local electromagnetic field up to wavelengths exceeding 1550&#160;nm. Hence, significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film comprising an Au CSNA and UC nanoparticles. Furthermore, an MLA polymer film is synergistically coupled with the HPU film, thereby focusing the incident near&#8208;infrared light in the micrometer region, including the plasmonic nanostructure area. Consequently, the plasmonic effect super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, significantly lowers the detectable power limit of a device, resulting in superior sensitivity and responsivity at weak excitation powers. Finally, a triple&#8208;cation perovskite&#8208;based photodetector coupled with the hybrid plasmonic UC film exhibits the excellent values of responsivity and detectivity of 9.80&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and 8.22&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at a weak power density of &#8776;0.03&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, demonstrating that the device performance is enhanced by more than 104 magnitudes over a reference sample.

&lt;p&gt;A super-boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film. The plasmonic effect, super-boosted by microfocusing the incident light, by MLA leads to superior sensitivity and responsivity of devices at weak near-infrared excitation powers.

         <title>A Hydrogel Ionic Circuit Based High&#8208;Intensity Iontophoresis Device for Intraocular Macromolecule and Nanoparticle Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC) is developed for highly effective intraocular delivery of macromolecule and nanoparticle drugs. The HIC&#8208;based device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87 mA cm&#8722;2) to the ocular tissue. Moreover, therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone in a nanoparticle formulation can be delivered to target tissues within 10&#8211;20 min of iontophoresis application.








Abstract
Iontophoresis is an electrical&#8208;current&#8208;based, noninvasive drug&#8208;delivery technology, which is particularly suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Current ocular iontophoresis devices use low current intensities that significantly limit macromolecule and nanoparticle (NP) delivery efficiency. Increasing current intensity leads to ocular tissue damage. Here, an iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC), for high&#8208;efficiency intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery, is described. The HIC&#8208;based device is capable of minimizing Joule heating, effectively buffering electrochemical (EC) reaction&#8208;generated pH changes, and absorbing electrode overpotential&#8208;induced heating. As a result, the device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, more than 10 times higher than current ocular iontophoresis devices) to the eye with minimal ocular cell death and tissue damage. The high&#8208;intensity iontophoresis significantly enhances macromolecule and NP delivery to both the anterior and posterior segments by up to 300 times compared to the conventional iontophoresis. Therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone are delivered to target tissue compartments within 10&#8211;20&#160;min of iontophoresis application. This study highlights the significant safety enhancement enabled by an HIC&#8208;based device design and the potential of the device to deliver therapeutic doses of macromolecule and NP ophthalmic drugs within a clinically relevant time frame.

         <title>Multivalent Noncovalent Interfacing and Cross&#8208;Linking of Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical synthetic supramolecular network is formed and interfaced to biomimetic surfaces using purely noncovalent interactions. Supramolecular synthetic copolymer bearing biotin linking group forms supramolecular networks upon addition of streptavidin, and can bind to streptavidin&#8208;modified surfaces. The architectures of these networks can be tuned by changing the biotin ratio in supramolecular copolymer and the concentration of streptavidin.








Abstract
Natural supramolecular filaments have the ability to cross&#8208;link with each other and to interface with the cellular membrane via biomolecular noncovalent interactions. This behavior allows them to form complex networks within as well as outside the cell, i.e., the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, respectively. The potential of artificial supramolecular polymers to interact through specific noncovalent interactions has so far only seen limited exploration due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions. Here, a system of synthetic supramolecular tubes that cross&#8208;link forming supramolecular networks, and at the same time bind to biomimetic surfaces by the aid of noncovalent streptavidin&#8211;biotin linkages, is demonstrated. The architecture of the networks can be engineered by controlling the density of the biotin moiety at the exterior of the tubes as well as by the concentration of the streptavidin. The presented strategy provides a pathway for designing adjustable artificial supramolecular superstructures, which can potentially yield more complex biomimetic adaptive materials.

         <title>Lateral Fully Organic P&#8211;N Diodes Created in a Single Donor&#8211;Acceptor Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lateral fully organic P&#8211;N diodes can be created in a single polymer, which exhibits a high rectification ratio &#8776;2100 and a high current density 3.83 A cm&#8722;2. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.








Abstract
P&#8211;N junctions exist in many solid&#8208;state organic devices, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. Creating P&#8211;N junctions by bulk chemical doping in a single organic material (like silicon doped by boron and phosphorus) may capitalize the vast scientific and technological groundwork established in the inorganic semiconducting field. However, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;organic&#8208;material P&#8211;N junctions are seldom reported, because the diffusion of the dopant counterions often leads to transient rectification properties. Herein, a new type of lateral fully organic diodes created in single donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) copolymer films with only one P&#8208;type dopant is reported. The achieved lateral devices exhibit high current densities of &#8776;3.83 A cm&#8722;2 and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;2100, which are beyond the requirements for high&#8208;frequency identification tags. The P&#8208; to N&#8208;type polarity switching mechanism is proposed after spectroscopic and structural tests. Decent stability of the organic diode is obtained, which is due to the long channel length and low diffusion speed of the large size of dopants. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.

         <title>Cluster Fragments in Amorphous Phosphorus and their Evolution under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven simulations provide new insight into the structure of amorphous phosphorus. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings and more complex cluster fragments. The simulation results help to understand previous experimental observations at ambient and high pressure, and they provide an example of the emerging application of machine&#8208;learned potentials to complex functional materials.








Abstract
Amorphous phosphorus (a&#8208;P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a&#8208;P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here, it is shown that large&#8208;scale molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine&#8208;learning (ML)&#8208;based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a&#8208;P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings, as well as more complex seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium&#8208;range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. The work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a&#8208;P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML&#8208;driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. The work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a-P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML-driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one multifunctional Janus separator is prepared using interfacial engineering strategies to improve the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The reversibility of the Li&#8208;metal anode is greatly enhanced and the shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode is effectively suppressed. This work offers a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the metallic Li anode and the sulfur cathode in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208;dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of the anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains high&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus and high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen&#8208;group&#8208;grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), by which the formation of &#8220;hot spots&#8221; can be effectively avoid, the Li&#8208;ion flux homogenized, and dendrite growth suppressed. Meanwhile, at the interface between the separator and the cathode, the homogenously exposed single&#8208;atom Ru on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; polysulfides and reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of the Janus separator, a lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell using the Janus separator delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 310.2&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the Li anode and the sulfur cathode in LSBs.

         <title>Lattice Polarity Manipulation of Quasi&#8208;vdW Epitaxial GaN Films on Graphene Through Interface Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of the lattice polarity of quasi&#8208;vdW epitaxial GaN on graphene through controlling the interface atomic configuration is reported. This polarity&#8208;control rule is not affected by the growth method and is free of either crystalline or non&#8208;crystalline substrates. It makes the epitaxy of III&#8208;nitrides with preferred lattice polarity possible and improves the ability to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices.








Abstract
Quasi van der Waals epitaxy, a pioneering epitaxy of sp3&#8208;hybridized semiconductor films on sp2&#8208;hybridized 2D materials, provides a way, in principle, to achieve single&#8208;crystal epilayers with preferred atom configurations that are free of substrate. Unfortunately, this has not been experimentally confirmed in the case of the hexagonal semiconductor III&#8208;nitride epilayer until now. Here, it is reported that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity are achieved by forming C&#63743;O&#63743;N&#63743;Ga(3) or C&#63743;O&#63743;Ga&#63743;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&#63743;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen pre&#8208;irradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question of why those reported wurtzite III&#8208;nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layers grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8211;Mechanical Synergistic In Situ Multiscale Tissue Adhesion for Sustainable Residue&#8208;Free Bioelectronics Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic&#8211;mechanical, synergistic, in situ, multiscale tissue adhesion for various bioelectronic applications is demonstrated. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. Reliable real&#8208;time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are also successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity&#8208;assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long&#8208;term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, an electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue&#8208;free, sustainable, in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive is proposed. The model supports the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid&#8208;insensitive, sustainable, in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Atomic Fe&#8211;N4/C in Flexible Carbon Fiber Membrane as Binder&#8208;Free Air Cathode for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Stable Cycling over 1000 h</title>

         <dc:description>
Flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon membrane with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C sites is constructed and used as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In virtue of the hierarchical porous structures and optimized local atomic configurations, the as&#8208;synthesized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free membrane as binder&#8208;free air cathode demonstrates a stable cycling over 1000 h for Zn&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free, durable, and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are vital for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The large specific surface area exposes a high concentration of Fe&#8211;N4/C sites embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. The as&#8208;synthesized Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86&#160;V/94.74&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) and most reported M&#8211;Nx/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid&#8208;state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 and long&#8208;term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid&#8208;state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Nucleation and Shaping of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling self&#8208;assembly is fundamentally challenging with implications for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Herein, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Light patterns enable positioning of composites in preassigned locations, sculpting of fine details and contours, and commanding the assembly of lines over millimeters with micrometer precision, hence combining the power of photolithography with self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlling self&#8208;assembly of nanocomposites is a fundamental challenge with exciting implications for next&#8208;generation advanced functional materials. Precursors for composites can be generated photochemically, but limited insight in the underlying processes has hindered precise hands&#8208;on guidance. In this study, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Carbonate is generated photochemically with UV light to steer the precipitation of nanocomposites of barium carbonate nanocrystals and amorphous silica (BaCO3/SiO2). Using a custom&#8208;built optical setup, the self&#8208;assembly process is controlled by optimizing the photogeneration, diffusion, reaction, and precipitation of the carbonate species, using the radius and intensity of the UV&#8208;light irradiated area and reaction temperature. Exploiting this control, nucleation is induced and the contours and individual features of the growing composite are sculpted according to micrometer&#8208;defined light patterns. Moreover, moving light patterns are exploited to create a constant carbonate concentration at the growth front to draw lines of nanocomposites with constant width over millimeters with micrometer precision. Light&#8208;directed generation of local gradients opens previously unimaginable opportunities for guiding self&#8208;assembly into functional materials.

         <title>The Quest for Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling potassium&#8208;ion battery is demonstrated, using a K2MnFe(CN)6 Prussian white cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode, and a concentrated electrolyte. This full cell delivers a high energy density of 260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and stable cycling over 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted wide interest for energy storage because of the abundance of the electrode materials involved; however, their electrochemical performances are far behind what can be achieved from lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) or sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, key promising electrode and electrolyte materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries are identified, the coupled electrochemical reactions in the cell are investigated, and the compatibility between different materials is demonstrated to play the most important role. K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode can deliver a high capacity of &#8776;125 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability over 61&#160;000 cycles (&#8776;9 months) if the side reactions from the anode can be prevented. Graphite is a good anode material but is subjected to degradation in traditional carbonate electrolytes. New concentrated electrolytes are developed and evaluated. A stable KIB system is demonstrated by coupling a stable K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode with a concentrated electrolyte to achieve a high energy density of &#8776;260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and good cycling of over 1000 cycles.

         <title>High Miscibility Compatible with Ordered Molecular Packing Enables an Excellent Efficiency of 16.2% in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel small&#8208;molecule donors with thioalkyl chains in the para&#8208; (P&#8208;PhS) and the meta&#8208;position (M&#8208;PhS) are synthesized to regulate surface tension and molecular packing. An optimized morphology with small domains and ordered packing is simultanously obtained in the M&#8208;PhS:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, promoting a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.2% with excellent (FF&#160;&#215; Jsc) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs).








Abstract
In all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs), a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) usually needs a small phase separation, while a high fill factor (FF) is generally realized in a highly ordered packing system. However, small domain and ordered packing always conflicted each other in ASM&#8208;OSCs, leading to a mutually restricted Jsc and FF. In this study, alleviation of the previous dilemma by the strategy of obtaining simultaneous good miscibility and ordered packing through modulating homo&#8208; and heteromolecular interactions is proposed. By moving the alkyl&#8208;thiolation side chains from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208;position in the small&#8208;molecule donor, the surface tension and molecular planarity are synchronously enhanced, resulting in compatible properties of good miscibility with acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9 and strong self&#8208;assembly ability. As a result, an optimized morphology with multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale domains and highly ordered packing is realized. The device exhibits a long carrier lifetime (39.8 &#956;s) and fast charge collection (15.5&#160;ns). A record efficiency of 16.2% with a high FF of 75.6% and a Jsc of 25.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the ASM&#8208;OSCs is obtained. These results demonstrate that the strategy of simultaneously obtaining good miscibility with high crystallinity could be an efficient photovoltaic material design principle for high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs.

         <dc:description>
To develop scalable, high&#8208;temperature capacitors, polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymer&#8208;based nanocomposites with very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed. The outstanding energy density of &#8776;1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;96%&#160;is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C under 200 MV m&#8722;1 (working conditions in hybrid electric vehicles), &#8776;2.5 times higher than the room&#8208;temperature performance of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biaxially oriented polypropylene.








Abstract
The developments of next&#8208;generation electric power systems and electronics demand for high temperature (&#8776;150&#160;&#176;C), high energy density, high efficiency, scalable, and low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;based dielectric capacitors are still scarce. Here, the nanocomposites based on polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymers with a very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed and synthesized. Under the actual working condition in hybrid electric vehicles of 200 MV m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, a high energy density of 1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency higher than 96% is achieved. This is about 2.5 times higher than the room temperature energy density (&#8776;0.39 J cm&#8722;3 under 200 MV m&#8722;1) of the commercially used biaxially oriented polypropylene, the benchmark of dielectric polymer. Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#160;&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20&#160;000 cycles of charge&#8208;discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high&#8208;temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low&#8208;cost strategy to develop high&#8208;temperature polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#160;&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20&#160;000 cycles of charge-discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high-temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low-cost strategy to develop high-temperature polymer-based capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Architecting Endogenous Heterojunction of MoS2 Coupling with Mo2CTx MXenes for Optimized Li+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX is constructed in situ. The obtained hetero&#8208;Mo2C shows extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with reversible structural transformation. Moreover, the improved capability of electron and ion transport endows hetero&#8208;Mo2C electrode with superior lithium storage performance, which surpasses all reported Mo2C MXenes electrode materials.








Abstract
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications, which is impeded by complex synthesis method and finite MAX materials. Herein, an in situ hydrothermal strategy is implemented to successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx (hetero&#8208;Mo2C) directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure caused by the introduction of MoS2 endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with improved charge transport and lithium ion adsorption capabilities. As a result, hetero&#8208;Mo2C exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 1242 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and long cycle stability of 683.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycling. This work provides new insights into rational design of novel MXenes heterojunctions, practically important for the development of MXenes and their applications in high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Nonfused Wide&#8208;Bandgap Acceptor for Versatile Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap nonfused nonfullerene acceptor named GS&#8208;ISO is designed and synthesized. GS&#8208;ISO exhibits a very flat molecular backbone and stable molecular conformation. Based on GS&#8208;ISO, outstanding power conversion efficiencies of over 19% (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for a tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell and over 28% (500&#160;lux, 2700&#160;K LED) for an indoor OPV cell are achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with nonfused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, NFAs named GS&#8208;OEH, GS&#8208;OC6, and GS&#8208;ISO, with optical bandgaps larger than 1.70&#160;eV, are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS&#8208;OEH and GS&#8208;OC6, GS&#8208;ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS&#8208;ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based cell with effective area of 1.0&#160;cm2&#160;exhibits a PCE of 28.37% under 2700&#160;K illumination of 500&#160;lux. A tandem OPV cell using PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO as the front subcell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based OPV cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing nonfused NFAs and also that GS&#8208;ISO is a promising WBG acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Photoconductivity Caused by Surface Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Stannates with Ultraviolet Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressure can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. Utilizing surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient, ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of the perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially&#160;confined and optically&#160;programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.








Abstract
Programmable optoelectronic devices call for the reversible control of the photocarrier recombination process by in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancies as a source of in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors have hampered the reversible formation of oxygen vacancies and their related phenomena. Here, a new strategy to manipulate the 2D photoconductivity from perovskite stannates is demonstrated by exploiting spatially&#160;selective photochemical reaction under ultraviolet illumination at room temperature. Remarkably, the ideal trap&#8208;free photocurrent of air&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;200&#160;pA) is reversibly switched into three orders of magnitude higher photocurrent of vacuum&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;335&#160;nA) with persistent photoconductivity depending on ambient oxygen pressure under illumination. Multiple characterizations elucidate that ultraviolet illumination of BaSnO3&#160;under low oxygen pressure induces surface oxygen vacancies as a result of surface photolysis combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient of BaSnO3; the concentrated oxygen vacancies are likely to induce a two&#8208;step transition of photocurrent response by changing the characteristics of in&#8208;gap states from the shallow level to the deep level. These results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8211;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#160;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Manipulating Electroluminochromism Behavior of Viologen&#8208;Substituted Iridium(III) Complexes through Ligand Engineering for Information Display and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes is designed to manipulate their electroluminochromism behavior. By attaching pyridiniums to the diimine or cyclometalating ligand and judiciously selecting the co&#8208;ligands, luminescence response to electrical stimuli is achieved in intensity, wavelength, and lifetime, which demonstrates anti&#8208;counterfeiting display through naked&#8208;eye detection, near&#8208;infrared camera, or time&#8208;resolved luminescence.








Abstract
Electrically controlling photoluminescence has attracted great research interest and offers many opportunities for technological developments. Electroluminochromic materials undergo redox reactions under low&#8208;voltage stimuli to achieve reversible luminescence switching. Till now, photoluminescence switching of a single molecule caused by electrical stimuli is restricted to intensity response because the redox&#8208;active moieties are good electron donors or acceptors and electrical stimuli can regulate the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer and affect the luminescence intensity. In this work, the manipulation of the electroluminochromism behavior of a series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes through the regulation of ligand orbital energy levels and electronic communication between the viologen pendants and the iridium(III) complex core is reported. Electrochemical redox reactions reversibly modulate either the luminescence quenching effect or the push&#8211;pull electronic effect of the viologen substituents, achieving multicolor &#8220;on&#8211;off&#8221; luminescence response toward electrical stimuli and luminescence manipulation between two emissive states with different wavelengths and lifetimes. To illustrate the promising applications of these electroluminochromic materials, recording and displaying luminescence information under electrical stimuli are demonstrated. Information encryption is realized by letting the electroluminochromism occur in the near&#8208;infrared region or in the time domain. Near&#8208;infrared camera or time&#8208;resolved luminescence analysis can be used to help read the invisible information.

         <title>High&#8208;Performing Self&#8208;Powered Photosensing and Reconfigurable Pyro&#8208;photoelectric Memory with Ferroelectric Hafnium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hafnium oxide (HfO2)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered, ultrafast (60 &#181;s), and high&#8208;performing (68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1) infrared pyroelectric sensor is developed. Further, a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory with controllable suspension and reestablishment of self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse is demonstrated. Using the innovative approach, advanced applications like memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency warning systems are offered.








Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8776; 60 &#181;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 is developed. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of the self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse are demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory. Potentially, the novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel Embodied with Macrophage&#8208;Regulation and Responsive&#8208;Gene&#8208;Silencing Properties for Synergistic Prevention of Peritendinous Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>

The MMP&#8208;2&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) loading guanidinobenzoic acid&#8208;modified generation 5 polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;GBA)/Smad3&#8208;small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticles (siRNA@MS) were fabricated by microfluidics technique, and then were incorporated into a self&#8208;healing hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel (siRNA@MS@HA) on the polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibers to form peritendinous anti&#8208;adhesion membrane. Here it is hypothesized that Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles would be released from GelMA MSs responded to the elevation of MMP&#8208;2 after tendon injury, thus downregulating the expression of Smad3 and fibroblast proliferation in peritendinous area. Moreover, the hydrogel&#8208;electrospun nanofibers could attenuate inflammation and act as a physical barrier to prevent adhesion tissue invading into the repaired tendon.








Abstract
Antiadhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self&#8208;healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel is constructed as a peritendinous antiadhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2)&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles are entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. GelMA MSs are responsively degraded by upregulation of MMP&#8208;2, achieving on&#8208;demand release of siRNA nanoparticles. Silencing effect of Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles is around 75% toward targeted gene. Furthermore, the self&#8208;healing hydrogel shows relatively attenuated inflammation compared to non&#8208;healing hydrogel. The mean adhesion scores of composite barrier group are 1.67 &#177; 0.51 and 2.17 &#177; 0.75 by macroscopic and histological evaluation, respectively. The proposed self&#8208;healing hydrogel antiadhesion barrier with MMP&#8208;2&#8208;responsive drug release behavior is highly effective for decreasing inflammation and inhibiting tendon adhesion. Therefore, this research provides a new strategy for the development of safe and effective antiadhesion barriers.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Polymerization of AIEgens for Light&#8208;Up Tumor Localization and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>

An aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen&#8208;peptide conjugates (D2P1) and 3CBT that can undergo in situ polymerization to form aggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin B enzyme reactions, the peptide cleavage on D2P1 induces covalent polymerization between 3CBT, which triggers aggregation and accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal and tumor treatment efficacy.








Abstract
Improving the enrichment of drugs or theranostic agents within tumors is vital to achieve effective cancer diagnosis and therapy with reduced dosage and damage to normal tissues. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;mediated aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen (AIEgen) intracellular polymerization strategy that can simultaneously promote the accumulation and retention of the AIEgen in the tumor for prolonged imaging and enhanced tumor growth inhibition is described. An AIEgen&#8208;peptide conjugate (D2P1) and cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;cysteine (3CBT) that can undergo rapid condensation reaction to form nanoaggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light&#8208;up. Such enzyme&#8208;mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built&#8208;in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 can remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme&#8208;mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescence from Pillar&#8208;Layer MOFs by Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient (QYphos.&#160;= 80.6%), long&#8208;lived (169.7&#160;ms) blue phosphorescence has been achieved in pillar&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on the isolation and lock of ligand chromophores. The potential applications of these phosphors in 3D printing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and fingerprint visualization have been demonstrated owing to the excellent chemical and mechanical stability.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy&#8208;metal containing complexes and purely organic systems. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long&#8208;lived lifetimes. Taking the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a model, herein, a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization is proposed, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long&#8208;lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co&#8208;ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores&#8217; motions through coordination and host&#8208;guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with highly efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization have been also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

         <title>Tailored Double Emulsions Made Simple</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method is developed to produce double emulsions of a single core and a thin shell at a milliliter per minute production rate, requiring minimal instrumentation, cost, and expertise. This two&#8208;step emulsification technique offers control of shell thickness, diversity of liquid formulations, integration with microfluidic devices, and potential to scale&#8208;up.








Abstract
Double emulsions, such as water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplets, are important material platforms for conducting fundamental research and for technological applications. To date, well&#8208;defined double&#8208;emulsion droplets consisting of a single water core and a thin oil shell can be exclusively formed with sophisticated microfluidic devices. The fabrication, preparation, and operation of such devices is challenging, which reduces the availability of tailored double emulsions to a limited community of experts. Here, a simple method is introduced to produce single&#8208;core double emulsions with high yield in large quantities, using a vortex mixer. Utilizing the density difference between the dispersed droplet and the continuous phase, this two&#8208;step emulsification method can achieve very small core droplet diameters below 10 &#956;m and ultrathin shells with thicknesses below 1 &#956;m. A detailed picture of the formation mechanism is provided and it is demonstrated that the process can be extended to produce multishell and multicore emulsions. Finally, its application is demonstrated to produce structurally colored colloidal supraparticles with unprecedented uniformity and yield. The method allows the creation of tailored double emulsions with minimal time, cost, effort, and expertise, and may widen its application to nonspecialized scientific communities.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted 4D Programming and Reprogramming of Liquid Crystalline Organogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropic approach is reported to program and reprogram the molecular ordering in liquid crystalline organogels via directed solvent evaporation. A wide variety of active origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of 3D printed LCNs with unattainable spatial and temporal control can be readily reached without meticulous alignment during network formation.








Abstract
Encoding molecular ordering during liquid crystalline network (LCN) formation endows preprogrammed but fixed shape morphing in response to external stimuli. The incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds enables shape reprogramming but also permanently alters the network structures. Here, an entropic approach that can program complex shapes via directed solvent evaporation from an isotropic LCN organogel is discoursed. Different shapes can be erased and reprogrammed from the same LCN on demand depending on the modes of deformation of the organogel during solvent evaporation. The ability to decouple network synthesis and molecular alignment relaxes the requirements to LCN chemistry and alignment methods, allowing for the realization of a variety of origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of LCNs printed from the digital light processing technique with unattainable spatial and temporal controls.

         <title>Strong Metal Phosphide&#8211;Phosphate Support Interaction for Enhanced Non&#8208;Noble Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for heterogeneous catalysis but limited by reducible oxide supports and the activity and stability contradiction. A new strong metal phosphide&#8211;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI) induced by P activation is reported for the non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with superior hydrogenation activity, stability, anti&#8208;oxidant and anti&#8208;acid capacity.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for supported catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Here is the first report on strong metal phosphide&#8208;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI). The key to SMPSI is the activation of P species on the support, which leads to simultaneous generation of metal phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) and core&#8211;shell nanostructures formed by support migration onto the NPs. The encapsulation state of metal phosphide and charge transfer are identical to those of classical SMSIs and can be optimally regulated. Furthermore, the strong interactions of Co2PL/MnP&#8208;3 not only significantly enhance the anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;acid capability of non&#8208;noble metal but also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability toward hydrogenating a wide range of compounds into value&#8208;added fine chemicals with 100% selectivity, which is even better than Pd/C and Pt/C. The SMPSI construction can be generally extended to other systems such as Ni2PL/Mn3(PO4)2, Co2PL/LaPO4, and CoPL/CePO4. This study provides a new approach for the rational design of advanced non&#8208;noble metal catalysts and introduce a novel paradigm for the strong interaction between NPs and support.

         <title>Toward Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens&#8217; Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces based on disordered arrangements of silicon nanoresonators are used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective optical diffusers with nearly Lambertian scattering profiles and a high tolerance for incidence angles and polarizations. Their working principles and scattering performances are discussed on the basis of exhaustive experimental and numerical studies. Such diffusers open new opportunities in applications like fluorescence microscopy, augmented reality displays, or wavefront&#8208;shaping.








Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. This work explores how dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces can implement wavelength&#8208;selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. The combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is shown to be an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. The proposed metasurfaces&#8217; directional scattering performance is characterized both experimentally and numerically, and their usability in wavefront&#8208;shaping applications is highlighted. Since the metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality displays.

Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. This work explores how dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces can implement wavelength-selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. The combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is shown to be an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. The proposed metasurfaces&#8217; directional scattering performance is characterized both experimentally and numerically, and their usability in wavefront-shaping applications is highlighted. Since the metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality displays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cell Sheet&#8208;Like Soft Nanoreactor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#160;nm&#8208;thick soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays are designed to confine and guide the inward crystallization of nanocrystals. Such cell&#8208;like soft nanoreactor sheets change the reaction kinetics and offer a general platform to synthesize a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures that are difficult to achieve using traditional bulk solution&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
Tissues, which consist of groups of closely packed cell arrays, are essentially sheet&#8208;like biosynthesis plants. In tissues, individual cells are discrete microreactors working under highly viscous and confined environments. Herein, soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays, as analogous nanoscale &#8220;sheet&#8208;like chemosynthesis plants&#8221;, for the controlled synthesis of novel nanocrystals, are reported. Although the soft polystyrene (PS) is only 3&#160;nm thick, it is elastic, robust, and permeable to aqueous solutes, while significantly slowing down their diffusion. PEN&#8208;associated palladium (Pd) crystallization follows a diffusion&#8208;controlled zero&#8208;order kinetics rather than a reaction&#8208;controlled first&#8208;order kinetics in bulk solution. Each individual PEN reactor has a volume in the zeptoliter range, which offers a unique confined environment, enabling a directional inward crystallization, in contrast to the conventional outward nucleation/growth that occurs in an unconfined bulk solution. This strategy makes it possible to generate a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures, which are difficult to achieve with normal systems based on bulk solutions.

         <title>Electronically and Geometrically Modified Single&#8208;Atom Fe Sites by Adjacent Fe Nanoparticles for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlations between electronic and geometric structures of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance are investigated by varying the secondary heat&#8208;treatment of a NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst. The adjacent Fe nanoparticles can regulate the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites, reducing energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials exhibit excellent activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most promising candidates to replace commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, it is challenging to unravel features of the superior ORR activity originating from Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials. In this work, the electronic and geometric structures of the isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their correlations with the ORR performance are investigated by varying the secondary thermal activation temperature of a rationally designed NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC). The systematic analyses demonstrate the significant role of coordinated atoms of SA and metallic Fe nanoparticles (NPs) in altering the electronic structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Meanwhile, strong interaction between isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and adjacent Fe NPs can change the geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that optimal regulation of the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites by the co&#8208;existence of Fe NPs narrows the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance. This work not only provides the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationship, but also sheds light on designing efficient Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging at 1550&#160;nm Boosts Orthotopic Glioblastoma Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of nanofluorophores is a promising approach for theranostic of orthotopic glioma. Brain&#8208;targeting nanofluorophores featuring novel molecular design of &#8220;backbone distortion + molecular rotor&#8221; are prepared. They can balance the photon energy flow to achieve advanced NIR&#8208;II imaging at 1550&#160;nm and photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat ratio for PTT in orthotopic&#8208;glioma&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
A remaining challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surmounting the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Such a challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) nanoparticles are developed via rational design, which involves twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation&#8208;mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550&#160;nm and non&#8208;radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR&#8208;PTT). The brain&#8208;targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550&#160;nm band&#8208;pass filter is utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of the nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcomes previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that the ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Collectively, the work highlights the smart design of a brain&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE theranostic approach that opens new diagnosis and treatment options in the photonic therapy of GBM.

Hetero&#8208;MXenes
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications. In article number 2108809, Li Song and co&#8208;workers successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX via an optimal in situ hydrothermal strategy. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and an optimized Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, with improved charge transport and Li+&#8208;adsorption capabilities.

   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; directly from Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C MAX via an optimal in situ hydrothermal strategy. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure endow the hetero-MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and an optimized Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-storage mechanism, with improved charge transport and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-adsorption capabilities.

2D Photoconductivity
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressures can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. In article number 2107650, utilizing a surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction, Junwoo Son and co&#8208;workers report that ultraviolet&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of a perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially confined and optically programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202105338"&gt;2105338&lt;/a&gt;, Donghee Son, Changhyun Pang, and co-workers report an electrostatic&#8211;mechanical synergistic multiscale tissue adhesive for sustainable residue-free bioelectronics interfaces. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. This patch also successfully demonstrates reliable real-time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, muscle, brain, and human skin.

         <title>Advanced Multifunctional Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries Design: From Materials and Devices to Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) can provide additional functions to realize unprecedented applications where conventional batteries normally fail. This review describes the recent advances of MARBs in terms of materials engineering, device design, system integration, and applications. The challenges and opportunities for further developments in the emerging field of MARBs are deeply discussed.








Abstract
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) are regarded as safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable electrochemical energy storage devices, which offer additional functionalities that conventional batteries cannot achieve, which ideally leads to unprecedented applications. Although MARBs are among the most exciting and rapidly growing topics in scientific research and industrial development nowadays, a systematic summary of the evolution and advances in the field of MARBs is still not available. Therefore, the review presented comprehensively and systematically summarizes the design principles and the recent advances of MARBs by categories of smart ARBs and integrated systems, together with an analysis of their device design and configuration, electrochemical performance, and diverse smart functions. The two most promising strategies to construct novel MARBs may be A) the introduction of functional materials into ARB components, and B) integration of ARBs with other functional devices. The ongoing challenges and future perspectives in this research and development field are outlined to foster the future development of MARBs. Finally, the most important upcoming research directions in this rapidly developing field are highlighted that may be most promising to lead to the commercialization of MARBs and to a further broadening of their range of applications.

         <dc:description>
This review analyzes the key factors that hinder the reversible conversion of conversion&#8208;type materials, provides a fundamental understanding of graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs), and provides guidance on the bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs to be used in high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation batteries, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G&#8208;ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G&#8208;ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion&#8208;type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMC materials for next&#8208;generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.

         <title>A Logic&#8208;Based Diagnostic and Therapeutic Hydrogel with Multistimuli Responsiveness to Orchestrate Diabetic Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel responsive to diabetic microenvironmental cues combined with the controlled delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory and osteogenic protein drugs. The logic&#8208;based drug release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects.








Abstract
The regeneration of diabetic bone defects remains challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by glucose fluctuation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and overexpression of proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual&#8208;logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel consisting of phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and gelatin colloids. It exhibits a &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; logic to interpret pathological cues (glucose fluctuation, ROS, MMPs) and determines when to release drug in a diabetic microenvironment and a therapeutic logic to program different cargo release to match immune&#8208;osteo cascade for better tissue regeneration. The hydrogel is also shown to be mechanically adaptable to the local complexity at the bone defect. Furthermore, the underlying therapeutic mechanism is elucidated, whereby the logic&#8208;based cargo release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects.

     alt="A Logic-Based Diagnostic and Therapeutic Hydrogel with Multistimuli Responsiveness to Orchestrate Diabetic Bone Regeneration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual logic-based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is developed through the design of a double-network hydrogel responsive to diabetic microenvironmental cues combined with the controlled delivery of anti-inflammatory and osteogenic protein drugs. The logic-based drug release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria-related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regeneration of diabetic bone defects remains challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by glucose fluctuation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and overexpression of proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual-logic-based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a double-network hydrogel consisting of phenylboronic-acid-crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and gelatin colloids. It exhibits a &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; logic to interpret pathological cues (glucose fluctuation, ROS, MMPs) and determines when to release drug in a diabetic microenvironment and a therapeutic logic to program different cargo release to match immune-osteo cascade for better tissue regeneration. The hydrogel is also shown to be mechanically adaptable to the local complexity at the bone defect. Furthermore, the underlying therapeutic mechanism is elucidated, whereby the logic-based cargo release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria-related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects. This study provides critical insight into the design and biological mechanism of dual-logic-based tissue-engineering strategies for diabetic bone regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanophotonic Materials for Twisted&#8208;Light Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted light, an unbounded set of helical spatial modes of electromagnetic light fields, offers both fundamental new insights into structured light&#8211;matter interactions and a new degree of freedom to boost optical and quantum information capacity. Recently, the nanophotonics field has transformed the photonic design and unveiled a diverse range of compact and multifunctional nanophotonic materials and devices for twisted&#8208;light manipulation.








Abstract
Twisted light, an unbounded set of helical spatial modes carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), offers not only fundamental new insights into structured light&#8211;matter interactions, but also a new degree of freedom to boost optical and quantum information capacity. However, current OAM experiments still rely on bulky, expensive, and slow&#8208;response diffractive or refractive optical elements, hindering today's OAM systems to be largely deployed. In the last decade, nanophotonics has transformed the photonic design and unveiled a diverse range of compact and multifunctional nanophotonic devices harnessing the generation and detection of OAM modes. Recent metasurface devices developed for OAM generation in both real and momentum space, presenting design principle and exemplary devices, are summarized. Moreover, recent development of whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode&#8208;based passive and tunable microcavities, capable of extracting degenerate OAM modes for on&#8208;chip vortex emission and lasing, is summarized. In addition, the design principle of different plasmonic devices and photodetectors recently developed for on&#8208;chip OAM detection is discussed. Current challenges faced by the nanophotonic field for twisted&#8208;light manipulation and future advances to meet these challenges are further discussed. It is believed that twisted&#8208;light manipulation in nanophotonics will continue to make significant impact on future development of ultracompact, ultrahigh&#8208;capacity, and ultrahigh&#8208;speed OAM systems&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>Understanding Nanomaterial&#8211;Liver Interactions to Facilitate the Development of Safer Nanoapplications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread exposure of nanomaterials to the body and gaining access to systemic circulation lead to nanomaterial liver accumulation. This induces cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses to NMs with various physicochemical properties. Understanding nano&#8208;liver interactions helps to develop safer nanoproducts and more effective nanomedicine.








Abstract
Nanomaterials (NMs) are widely used in commercial and medical products, such as cosmetics, vaccines, and drug carriers. Exposure to NMs via various routes such as dermal, inhalation, and ingestion has been shown to gain access to the systemic circulation, resulting in the accumulation of NMs in the liver. The unique organ structures and blood flow features facilitate the liver sequestration of NMs, which may cause adverse effects in the liver. Currently, most in vivo studies are focused on NMs accumulation at the organ level and evaluation of the gross changes in liver structure and functions, however, cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses, as well as the molecular mechanisms at cellular levels leading to effects at organ levels are lagging. Herein, the authors systematically review diverse interactions of NMs with the liver, specifically on major liver cell types including Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes as well as the detailed molecular mechanisms involved. In addition, the knowledge gained on nano&#8208;liver interactions that can facilitate the development of safer nanoproducts and nanomedicine is also reviewed.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Wide&#8208;Gamut Coloration at the Diffraction Limit in Flexible, Self&#8208;Assembled Hierarchical Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric structural coloration platform that simultaneously addresses all areas required for real&#8208;world commercial applications is implemented: wide colors gamut, also exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum, low manufacturing costs, large&#8208;scale printing demonstrated on entire wafers and 4 in. flexible substrates, and high printing resolutions at a constant 101&#8201;600 dots per inch.








Abstract
Unveiling physical phenomena that generate controllable structural coloration is at the center of significant research efforts due to the platform potential for the next generation of printing, sensing, displays, wearable optoelectronics components, and smart fabrics. Colors based on e&#8208;beam facilities possess high resolutions above 100k dots per inch (DPI), but limit manufacturing scales up to 4.37&#160;cm2, while requiring rigid substrates that are not flexible. State&#8208;of&#8208;art scalable techniques, on the contrary, provide either narrow gamuts or small resolutions. A common issue of current methods is also a heterogeneous resolution, which typically changes with the color printed. Here, a structural coloration platform with broad gamuts exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum in inexpensive, thermally resistant, flexible, and metallic&#8208;free structures at constant 101&#8201;600&#160;DPI (at the diffraction limit), obtained via mass&#8208;production manufacturing is demonstrated. This platform exploits a previously unexplored physical mechanism, which leverages the interplay between strong scattering modes and optical resonances excited in fully 3D dielectric nanostructures with suitably engineered longitudinal profiles. The colors obtained with this technology are scalable to any area, demonstrated up to the single wafer (4 in.). These results open real&#8208;world applications of inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution, large&#8208;scale structural colors with broad chromatic spectra.

         <title>Unraveling Crystallization Mechanisms and Electronic Structure of Phase&#8208;Change Materials by Large&#8208;Scale Ab Initio Simulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization mechanism of GeSb2Te4 is described via ab initio computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1000 atoms. The smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel is utilized to reveal the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order during crystallization. The connection between structural and electronic properties of the recrystallized models is studied.








Abstract
Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te (&#8220;GST&#8221;) alloys are leading phase&#8208;change materials for digital memories and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon fast crystallization, these materials form rocksalt&#8208;like phases with large structural and vacancy disorder, leading to an insulating phase at low temperature. Here, a comprehensive description of crystallization, structural disorder, and electronic properties of GeSb2Te4 based on realistic, quantum&#8208;mechanically based (&#8220;ab initio&#8221;) computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1000 atoms is provided. It is shown how an analysis of the crystallization mechanism based on the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel reveals the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order. The connection between structural and electronic properties of the disordered, as&#8208;crystallized models, which are relevant to the transport properties of GST, is then studied. Furthermore, it is shown how antisite defects and extended Sb&#8208;rich motifs can lead to Anderson localization in the conduction band. Beyond memory applications, these findings are therefore more generally relevant to disordered rocksalt&#8208;like chalcogenides that exhibit self&#8208;doping, since they can explain the origin of Anderson insulating behavior in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;doped chalcogenide materials.

The benefits of 3D bioprinting technologies for skeletal muscle tissue engineering are highlighted. Skeletal muscle physiology, muscle regeneration following injury, and current treatments are discussed. Subsequently, bioprinting strategies implemented for muscle tissue engineering are critically reviewed. Recent advances in bioinks and bioprinting strategies to construct large tissues, boost myogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and enhance integration are discussed.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles play important roles in critical body functions and their injury or disease can lead to limitation of mobility and loss of independence. Current treatments result in variable functional recovery, while reconstructive surgery, as the gold&#8208;standard approach, is limited due to donor shortage, donor&#8208;site morbidity, and limited functional recovery. Skeletal muscle tissue engineering (SMTE) has generated enthusiasm as an alternative solution for treatment of injured tissue and serves as a functional disease model. Recently, bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for recapitulating the complex and highly organized architecture of skeletal muscles at clinically relevant sizes. Here, skeletal muscle physiology, muscle regeneration following injury, and current treatments following muscle loss are discussed, and then bioprinting strategies implemented for SMTE are critically reviewed. Subsequently, recent advancements that have led to improvement of bioprinting strategies to construct large muscle structures, boost myogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and enhance tissue integration are discussed. Bioinks for muscle bioprinting, as an essential part of any bioprinting strategy, are discussed, and their benefits, limitations, and areas to be improved are highlighted. Finally, the directions the field should expand to make bioprinting strategies more translational and overcome the clinical unmet needs are discussed.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Confined Printing of Programmable Organic Microcrystal Assemblies for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable organic microcrystal assemblies with dynamic tunable shapes and orientations are manufactured using a virtual, dynamic, noncontact template created by magnetic domain confined printing method. The highly reproducible shape switching enables it to be encoded into a multilevel QR code that encrypts, decrypts, and erases security information by applying a magnetic field.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale assembly of organic micro/nanocrystals into well&#8208;defined patterns with programmable structures is essential for applications such as information encryption at both high data density and high security level. Here, a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted approach that produces programmable assemblies of organic microcrystals with various shapes and orientations, using the magnetic domains of the underlying ferromagnetic metal microarrays as the printing templates, is developed. The diamagnetic microcrystals tend to aggregate in the regions of minimal field strength, and thus their assembly behavior is precisely controlled by the local field distribution on top of magnetic domains on substrate. The dynamic assembly process of microcrystal assemblies can be programmed upon the sequence of applied field, and their shape changes are &#8776;100% reproducible on a large scale (&gt;20&#8201;000 sites over 1 cm2). These features of magnetically programmable assemblies are ideally suited for information encryption, for which the encryption&#8211;decryption&#8211;erasing of multilevel information from a QR&#8208;code pattern based on the microcrystal assemblies under magnetic field is demonstrated.

         <title>Boosting Continuous&#8208;Wave Laser&#8208;Driven Nonlinear Photothermal White Light Generation by Nanoscale Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;laser&#8208;driven white light emission intensity can be enhanced up to 100 folds by introducing nanoscale porosity to a silica medium doped with rare&#8208;earth ions. The process involves strong nonlinear photothermal emission, and it is promising to be used as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing.








Abstract
The irradiation of an optically absorptive medium by a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser can result in a spectral continuum emission covering both the visible and NIR regions, which is attractive for applications as continuum light sources in diverse fields. It is shown here that this NIR&#8208;laser&#8208;driven light emission can be effectively modulated with nanoscale architecture in the medium. By using porous silica as the model matrix and Yb3+ ions as the photothermally active centers, up to 100 folds increment in NIR&#8208;laser&#8208;induced emission intensity and dramatic decrease in threshold excitation density are demonstrated. It is observed that the emission intensity exhibits a strong nonlinear dependence on the power of the NIR excitation laser, featuring clear excitation power thresholds. Based on combined numerical simulation and spectral and temperature measurements, the improved broadband emission and photothermal nonlinearity are interpreted by enhanced optical energy localization around the laser spot that results in boosting the photon&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion efficiency. The use of the nonlinear photothermal emission process as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing, is further demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.

         <title>Tough, Transparent, 3D&#8208;Printable, and Self&#8208;Healing Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;Gel (PEGgel)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient solvent strategy is proposed to enhance and refine the performance of polymer gel with a large range via using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent. Due to this unique solvent system, the obtained gel exhibits long&#8208;lasting performance (&gt;1 month), high stretchability (6000%), rapid self&#8208;healing (1&#160;min), suitable for self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuators.








Abstract
Polymer gels, such as hydrogels, have been widely used in biomedical applications, flexible electronics, and soft machines. Polymer network design and its contribution to the performance of gels has been extensively studied. In this study, the critical influence of the solvent nature on the mechanical properties and performance of soft polymer gels is demonstrated. A polymer gel platform based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent is reported (PEGgel). Compared to the corresponding hydrogel or ethylene glycol gel, the PEGgel with physically cross&#8208;linked poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) demonstrates high stretchability and toughness, rapid self&#8208;healing, and long&#8208;term stability. Depending on the molecular weight and fraction of PEG, the tensile strength of the PEGgels varies from 0.22 to 41.3 MPa, fracture strain from 12% to 4336%, modulus from 0.08 to 352 MPa, and toughness from 2.89 to 56.23 MJ m&#8211;3. Finally, rapid self&#8208;healing of the PEGgel is demonstrated and a self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuator is fabricated by 3D&#8208;printing. The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system may be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross&#8208;linked). Such a simple 3D&#8208;printable, self&#8208;healing, and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.

         <title>Gridization&#8208;Driven Mesoscale Self&#8208;Assembly of Conjugated Nanopolymers into Luminescence&#8208;Anisotropic Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors create the photonic&#8208;crystal&#8208;directed molecular design platform through covalent gridization of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers. Via solvent&#8208;casting method, conjugated nanopolymers perform the in situ mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into 1D photonic crystals with multilayer microstructures. These photonic crystals show a high mechanical toughness, a high optical transmittance, an angle&#8208;dependent photoluminescence switching, and an ultralow waveguide loss, potential for bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Organic semiconducting emitters integrated with butterfly&#8208;mimetic photonic crystals (PhCs) are fascinating for dramatic advantages over light outcoupling efficiency and multifunctional strain sensors, as well as the key step toward electrically pumped lasers. Herein, an unprecedentedly direct mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into 1D PhCs is reported through a covalently gridization&#8208;driven approach of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers.

&lt;p&gt;The authors create the photonic-crystal-directed molecular design platform through covalent gridization of wide-bandgap conjugated polymers. Via solvent-casting method, conjugated nanopolymers perform the in situ mesoscale self-assembly into 1D photonic crystals with multilayer microstructures. These photonic crystals show a high mechanical toughness, a high optical transmittance, an angle-dependent photoluminescence switching, and an ultralow waveguide loss, potential for bio-inspired multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic semiconducting emitters integrated with butterfly-mimetic photonic crystals (PhCs) are fascinating for dramatic advantages over light outcoupling efficiency and multifunctional strain sensors, as well as the key step toward electrically pumped lasers. Herein, an unprecedentedly direct mesoscale self-assembly into 1D PhCs is reported through a covalently gridization-driven approach of wide-bandgap conjugated polymers. A simple solvent-casting procedure allows for in situ self-assembly of the state-of-the-art conjugated nanopolymer, poly{[4-(octyloxy)-9,9-diphenylfluoren-2,7-diyl]grid}-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-{[5-(octyloxy)-9,9-diphenylfluoren-2,7-diyl]grid} (PODPFG), into well-defined multilayer architectures with an excellent toughness (30&#8211;40 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;3&lt;/sup&gt;). This ordered meso-architecture shows a typical Bragg&#8211;Snell diffraction behavior to testify the PhC nature, along with a high effective refractive index (1.80&#8211;1.88) and optical transmittance (85&#8211;87%).

         <title>Tunable Nanoscale Evolution and Topological Phase Transitions of a Polar Vortex Supercrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical simulation and X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that the stability and nanoscale evolution of the polar vortex supercrystal with 3D periodicity in the PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice under optical, thermal, and electrical stimuli, which includes the erase process of the supercrystal, the new stripe supercrystal, as well as the vortex&#8211;skyrmion topological phase transition.








Abstract
Understanding the phase transitions and domain evolutions of mesoscale topological structures in ferroic materials is critical to realizing their potential applications in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance storage devices. Here, the behaviors of a mesoscale supercrystal are studied with 3D nanoscale periodicity and rotational topology phases in a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 (PTO/STO) superlattice under thermal and electrical stimuli using a combination of phase&#8208;field simulations and X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. A phase diagram of temperature versus polar state is constructed, showing the formation of the supercrystal from a mixed vortex and a&#8208;twin state and a temperature&#8208;dependent erasing process of a supercrystal returning to a classical a&#8208;twin structure. Under an in&#8208;plane electric field bias at room temperature, the vortex topology of the supercrystal irreversibly transforms to a new type of stripe&#8208;like supercrystal. Under an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the vortices inside the supercrystal undergo a topological phase transition to polar skyrmions. These results demonstrate the potential for the on&#8208;demand manipulation of polar topology and transformations in supercrystals using electric fields. The findings provide a theoretical understanding that may be utilized to guide the design and control of mesoscale polar structures and to explore novel polar structures in other systems and their topological nature.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions in a Thickness Tunable 2D Ferromagnet from a Defect Driven Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of skyrmions in 2D materials has opened a door to novel tunability of their magnetic structure. Here, it is shown that the chiral N&#233;el skyrmions are stabilized in the metallic 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, as a result of breaking of the inversion symmetry of its crystal structure that is derived from an asymmetric distribution of Fe atoms in alternate layers in the compound. It is found that the skyrmion size in this compound is strongly influenced by the sample thickness and changes from &#8776;100 to &#8776;700&#160;nm as the sample thickness is increased from &#8776;90&#160;nm to &#8776;2 &#181;m.








Abstract
There is considerable interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials as potential hosts for chiral skyrmionic spin textures. Of particular interest is the ferromagnetic, metallic compound Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), which has a comparatively high Curie temperature (150&#8211;220 K). Several recent studies have reported the observation of chiral N&#233;el skyrmions in this compound, which is inconsistent with its presumed centrosymmetric structure. Here the observation of N&#233;el type skyrmions in single crystals of FGT via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) is reported. It is shown from detailed X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis that FGT lacks an inversion symmetry as a result of an asymmetric distribution of Fe vacancies. This vacancy&#8208;induced breaking of the inversion symmetry of this compound is a surprising and novel observation and is a prerequisite for a Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya vector exchange interaction which accounts for the chiral N&#233;el skyrmion phase. This phenomenon is likely to be common to many 2D vdW materials and suggests a path to the preparation of many such acentric compounds. Furthermore, it is found that the skyrmion size in FGT is strongly dependent on its thickness: the skyrmion size increases from &#8776;100 to &#8776;750&#160;nm as the thickness of the lamella is increased from &#8776;90&#160;nm to &#8776;2&#160;&#181;m. This extreme size tunability is a feature common to many low symmetry ferro&#8208; and ferri&#8208;magnetic compounds.

         <title>P&#8208;Doped NiTe2 with Te&#8208;Vacancies in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries Prevents Shuttling and Promotes Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doped NiTe2 electrocatalysts with Te&#8208;vacancies are fabricated on maize&#8208;straw carbon nanosheets to act as separators in Li&#8211;S batteries. They exhibit high conductivities and strong polysulfide adsorption, which increase redox conversions and sulfur electrochemistry.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish polysulfide conversion kinetics. Here, a P&#8208;doped nickel tellurium electrocatalyst with Te&#8208;vacancies (P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x) anchored on maize&#8208;straw carbon (MSC) nanosheets, served as a functional layer (MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x) on the separator of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. The P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x electrocatalyst enhanced the intrinsic conductivity, strengthened the chemical affinity for polysulfides, and accelerated sulfur redox conversion. The MSC nanosheets enabled NiTe2 nanoparticle dispersion and Li+ diffusion. In situ Raman and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra confirmed that the MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x restrained the shuttle effect and accelerated the redox conversion. The MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x&#8208;based cell has a cyclability of 637 mAh g&#8208;1 at 4 C over 1800 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.0139% per cycle, high rate performance of 726 mAh g&#8208;1 at 6 C, and a high areal capacity of 8.47 mAh cm&#8208;2 under a sulfur configuration of 10.2&#160;mg cm&#8208;2, and a low electrolyte/sulfur usage ratio of 3.9. This work demonstrates that vacancy&#8208;induced doping of heterogeneous atoms enables durable sulfur electrochemistry and can impact future electrocatalytic designs related to various energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Electronegativity&#8208;Induced Charge Balancing to Boost Stability and Activity of Amorphous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability of amorphous MoSxOy via a charge&#8208;balancing strategy is reported. Co&#8208;doping of Rh and Sn with different electronegativities induces local charge redistribution, which shifts the H attacking site and HER&#8208;active sites. As a result, the co&#8208;doped amorphous catalysts outperform undoped and single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped MoSxOy.








Abstract
Amorphization is an efficient strategy to activate intrinsically inert catalysts. However, the low crystallinity of amorphous catalysts often causes high solubility and poor electrochemical stability in aqueous solution. Here, a different mechanism is developed to simultaneously stabilize and activate the water&#8208;soluble amorphous MoSxOy via a charge&#8208;balancing strategy, which is induced by different electronegativity between the co&#8208;dopants Rh (2.28) and Sn (1.96). The electron&#8208;rich Sn prefers to stabilize the unstable apical O sites in MoSxOy through charge transfer, which can prevent the H from attacking. Meanwhile, the Rh, as the charge regulator, shifts the main active sites on the basal plane from inert Sn to active apical Rh sites. As a result, the amorphous RhSn&#8208;MoSxOy exhibits drastic enhancement in electrochemical stability (&#951;10 increases only by 12&#160;mV) after 1000 cycles and a distinct activity (&#951;10: 26&#160;mV and Tafel: 30.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic solution. This work paves a route for turning impracticably water&#8208;soluble catalysts into treasure and inspires new ideas to design high&#8208;performance amorphous electrocatalysts.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Flux Nanoporous Graphene Membrane for Sustainable Seawater Desalination using Low&#8208;Grade Heat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin nanoporous graphene membrane is developed, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The fabrication process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes generally required for graphene membranes. In direct&#8208;contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature gradient, the membrane shows outstanding performance and holds great potential for water desalination toward a low&#8208;carbon future.








Abstract
Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development of sustainable desalination and zero&#8208;discharge processes because of its possibility of recovering 100% water and the potential for integration with low&#8208;grade heat, such as solar energy. However, the conventional membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing its practical application. Here, ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes are reported by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top edges of a highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the direct&#8208;contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair of 65/25&#160;&#176;C,&#160;the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average water flux of 421.7 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with over 99.8% salt rejection, which is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes. The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using water from the Red Sea heated under direct sunlight radiation show that the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from 8 am to 8 pm, showing a great potential for real applications in seawater desalination.

         <title>Graphene on Chromia: A System for Beyond&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust spin&#8208;dependent transport is demonstrated well beyond room temperature in heterostructures of graphene and the antiferromagnetic oxide chromia. The spin&#8208;dependent transport is attributed to the symmetry&#8208;breaking action of chromia, and persists at zero magnetic field and despite the absence of any ferromagnetic elements in the devices. These results represent an important advance for practical spintronics based on graphene.








Abstract
Evidence of robust spin&#8208;dependent transport in monolayer graphene, deposited on the (0001) surface of the antiferromagnetic (AFM)/magneto&#8208;electric oxide chromia (Cr2O3), is provided. Measurements performed in the non&#8208;local spin&#8208;Hall geometry reveal a robust signal that is present at zero external magnetic field and which is significantly larger than any possible ohmic contribution. The spin&#8208;related signal persists well beyond the N&#233;el temperature (&#8776;307 K) that defines the transition between the AFM and paramagnetic states, remaining visible at the highest studied temperature of close to 450 K. This robust character is consistent with prior theoretical studies of the graphene/Cr2O3 system, predicting that the lifting of sub&#8208;lattice symmetry in the graphene shall induce an effective spin&#8211;orbit term of &#8776;40 meV. Overall, the results indicate that graphene&#8208;on&#8208;chromia heterostructures are a highly promising framework for the implementation of spintronic devices, capable of operation well beyond room temperature.

Abstract
Impossible voltage plateau regulation for the cathode materials with fixed active elemental center is a pressing issue hindering the development of Na&#8208;super&#8208;ionic conductor (NASICON) type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we pioneeringly utilize high&#8208;entropy substitution strategy, to alter detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing central active V atom, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. As&#8208;prepared carbon&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE&#8208;NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81&#160;V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1, which is attributed by the diverse transition metal elemental substitution in high&#8208;entropy crystalline. More importantly, high&#8208;entropy introducing can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low&#8208;voltage region, further lifting up mean working voltage to realize a full Na ions storage at high voltage plateau. Coupling with hard carbon (HC) anode, HE&#8208;NVPF//HC SIBs full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 at 5C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg&#8211;1. This route let the unlikely potential regulation in NASICON&#8208;type crystal with unchangeable active center becomes possible, inspiring new ideas on elevating mean working voltage for SIBs cathodes.

         <title>Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Enables Tuning of Nanopores in Atomically Thin Graphene Membranes for Highly Selective Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membranes with precise pore size distributions are needed for efficient and selective separations for a sustainable future. Self&#8208;assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes across nanopores in atomically thin graphene membranes is shown to enable controllable size&#8208;dependent sealing of nanopores to tighten their size distribution and attenuate leakage. The enhanced membrane selectivity, without compromising water permeance, allows for desalination under forward osmosis.








Abstract
Atomically thin membranes comprising nanopores in a 2D material promise to surpass the performance of polymeric membranes in several critical applications, including water purification, chemical and gas separations, and energy harvesting.

     alt="Molecular Self-Assembly Enables Tuning of Nanopores in Atomically Thin Graphene Membranes for Highly Selective Transport"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membranes with precise pore size distributions are needed for efficient and selective separations for a sustainable future. Self-assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes across nanopores in atomically thin graphene membranes is shown to enable controllable size-dependent sealing of nanopores to tighten their size distribution and attenuate leakage. The enhanced membrane selectivity, without compromising water permeance, allows for desalination under forward osmosis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically thin membranes comprising nanopores in a 2D material promise to surpass the performance of polymeric membranes in several critical applications, including water purification, chemical and gas separations, and energy harvesting. However, fabrication of membranes with precise pore size distributions that provide exceptionally high selectivity and permeance in a scalable framework remains an outstanding challenge. Circumventing these constraints, here, a platform technology is developed that harnesses the ability of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to self-assemble preferentially across larger, relatively leaky atomically thin nanopores by exploiting the lower steric hindrance of such larger pores to molecular interactions across the pores. By selectively tightening the pore size distribution in this manner, self-assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes simultaneously introduced on opposite sides of nanoporous graphene membranes is demonstrated to discriminate between nanopores to seal non-selective transport channels, while minimally compromising smaller, water-selective pores, thereby remarkably attenuating solute leakage. This improved membrane selectivity enables desalination across centimeter-scale nanoporous graphene with 99.7% and &amp;gt;90%&#160;rejection of MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NaCl, respectively, under forward osmosis. These findings provide a versatile strategy to augment the performance of nanoporous atomically thin membranes and present intriguing possibilities of controlling reactions across 2D materials via exclusive exploitation of pore size-dependent intermolecular interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alternate Storage of Opposite Charges in Multisite for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Al&#8210;MOF Battery</title>

Abstract
The limited active sites of cathode materials in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) restrict the storage of more large&#8208;sized Al&#8208;complex ions, leading to a low celling of theoretical capacity. To make the utmost of active sites, we herein propose an alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges (AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations) in multisites to achieve an ultrahigh capacity in Al&#8210;MOF battery. The bipolar ligands (oxidized from 18&#960; to 16&#960; electrons and reduced from 18&#960; to 20&#960; electrons in a planar cyclic conjugated system) can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which can double the capacity of unipolar ligands. Moreover, the high&#8208;density active Cu sites (Cu nodes) in 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF could also store AlCl2+ cations for a higher capacity. The rigid and extended MOF structure can address the problems of high solubility and poor stability of small organic molecules. As a result, three&#8208;step redox reactions with two&#8208;electron transfer in each step are demonstrated in charge/discharge processes, achieving high reversible capacity (184 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (177&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) of the optimized cathode in Al&#8210;MOF battery. Our findings provide a new insight for rational design of stable high&#8208;energy Al&#8211;MOF batteries.

         <title>Plasmonic Active &#8220;Hot Spots&#8221;&#8208;Confined Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity for CH4 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures have tremendous potential to be applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, since their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can collect low&#8208;energy&#8208;photons to derive energetic &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; for reducing the CO2 activation&#8208;barrier. However, the hot electron&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is usually limited by poor efficiency and low selectivity for producing kinetically unfavourable hydrocarbons. Here, we propose a new idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalysis to overcome this drawback. We assemble W18O49 nanowires on the outer surface of Au nanoparticles&#8208;embedded TiO2 electrospun nanofibers to obtain lots of Au/TiO2/W18O49 sandwich&#8208;like sub&#8208;structures in the formed plasmonic heterostructure. The short distance (&lt; 10&#160;nm) between Au and adjacent W18O49 can induce an intense plasmon&#8208;coupling to form the active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the sub&#8208;structures. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; are capable of not only gathering the incident light to enhance &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; generation and migration, but also capturing protons and CO through the dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;active&#8208;sites (Au&#8208;O&#8208;Ti and W&#8208;O&#8208;Ti) at the Au/TiO2/W18O49 interface, as evidenced by systematic experiments and simulation analyses. Thus, during photocatalytic CO2 reduction at 43&#177; 2&#8451;,&#160;these active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; enriched in the well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure could synergistically confine the hot&#8208;electron, proton, and CO intermediates for resulting in the CH4 and CO production&#8208;rates at &#8764;35.55 and &#8764;2.57&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, and the CH4&#8208;product selectivity at &#8764;93.3%.

         <title>Interpretation of Rubidium&#8208;based Perovskite Recipes towards Electronic Passivation and Ion Diffusion Mitigation</title>

Abstract
Rubidium cation (Rb+) addition has been witnessed to play a pivotal role in boosting the comprehensive performance of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, the origin of such success derived from irreplaceable superiorities brought by Rb+ remains ambiguous. Herein, grain boundary&#8208;included atomic models, for the first time, have been adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb+ distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution covering both grain interiors and boundaries has been thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron&#8208;based grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior have been expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb+ addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability has been elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb+ concentration on electronic defect, ion migration and phase stability are completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high&#8208;efficiency cascade incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Artificial Hybrid Nanocells for Boosted Vascular Regeneration in Ischemic Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Restoration of sufficient blood supply for the treatment of ischemia remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Here, we introduce a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery technology that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions for the spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration. Specifically, a copper&#8208;containing protein was successfully prepared using a recombinant protein scaffold based on a de novo design strategy, which facilitated the timely release of nitric oxide (NO) and improved accumulation of particles within ischemic tissues. Through closely mimicking physiological cues, we demonstrated the benefits of bioactive factors secreted from hypoxic stem cells on promoting angiogenesis. Following this cell&#8208;mimicking manner, artificial hybrid nano&#8208;sized cells (Hynocell) were constructed by integrating the hypoxic stem cell secretome into nanoparticles with surface coatings of cell membranes fused with copper&#8208;containing protein. The Hynocell, hybridized with different cell&#8208;derived components, provided synergistic effects on targeting ischemic tissues and promoting vascular regeneration in acute hindlimb ischemia and acute myocardial infarction models. This study offers new insights into the utilization of nanotechnology to potentiate the development of cell&#8208;free therapeutics.

MOF&#8208;derived electrocatalysts/electrodes have excellent prospects in energy storage and conversion systems. This paper presents an in&#8208;depth review of the application of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and overall water splitting, highlighting experimental and computational results demonstrated in the literature. Recent progress in synthesis routes and strategies used to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of ZIF&#8208;67 derived electrocatalysts is explicitly discussed.








Abstract
Design and construction of low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is a challenging task in the field of catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water&#8208;splitting reaction. Then, different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt&#8208;based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF&#8208;67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal&#8208;doped carbon, noble metal&#8208;supported ZIF&#8208;67 derivatives) reported for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and the perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Artificial Heterogeneous Interphase Layer with Boosted Ion Affinity and Diffusion for Na/K Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic Na (K) is considered a promising anode material for Na (K) metal batteries because of its high theoretical capacity, low electrode potential, and abundant resources. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, we introduce a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K). Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that a heterogeneous Na2S/V (K2S/V) protective layer can effectively improve Na (K)&#8208;ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics, inhibiting the growth of Na (K) dendrites during Na (K) plating/stripping. Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na2S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, and the K2S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na3V2(PO4)3||Na2S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 and a high power density of 23.5&#160;kW kg&#8211;1. Our achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Unconventional Doping Effect Leads to Ultrahigh Average Thermoelectric Power Factor in Cu3SbSe4&#8208;based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric materials are typically highly degenerate semiconductors, which require high carrier concentration. However, the efficiency of conventional doping by replacing host atoms with alien ones is restricted by solubility limit, and more unfavorably, such doping method is likely to cause strong charge carrier scattering at ambient temperature, leading to deteriorated electrical performance. Here, we propose an unconventional doping strategy by using a small trace of alien atoms to stabilize cation vacancies in Cu3SbSe4 by compositing with CuAlSe2, in which cation vacancies rather than alien atoms provide high density of holes. Consequently, the hole concentration enlarges by 6 times but the carrier mobility is well maintained. As a result, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19 &#956;W cm&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 in the temperature range of 300&#8764;723 K is attained. Finally, with further reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a peak zT value of 1.4 and a record&#8208;high average zT value of 0.72 are achieved within the diamond&#8208;like compounds. Our new doping strategy not only can be applied for boosting the average power factor for thermoelectrics, but more generally can be used to maintain carrier mobility for a variety of semiconductors that need high carrier concentration.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Dopant Selection for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: The Case Study of Fe2O3 and CuO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning is applied to guide rational dopant selection in metal oxide photoelectrodes with improved photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. The chemical state is found to be the most significant factor for dopant selection, while dopants with stronger metal&#8211;oxygen bond and larger ionic radius are preferred for charge separation and transfer.








Abstract
Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide&#8208;based semiconductors for solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Machine learning (ML) is promising in providing predictable insights on the dopant selection for high&#8208;performing PEC systems because it can uncover correlations from the seemingly ambiguous linkages between vast features of dopants and the PEC performance of doped photoelectrodes. Herein, the authors successfully build ML model to predict the doping effect of 17 metal dopants into hematite (Fe2O3), a prototype photoelectrode material. Their findings disclose the critical parameters from the 10 intrinsic features of each dopant. The model is further experimentally validated by the coherent prediction on Y and La dopants&#8217; behaviors. Further interpretation of the ML model suggests that the chemical state is the most significant selection criteria, meanwhile, dopants with higher metal&#8211;oxygen bond formation enthalpy and larger ionic radius are favored in improving the charge separation and transfer (CST) in the Fe2O3 photoanodes. The generic feature of this ML guided selection criteria has been further extended to CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes showing improved CST by alkaline metal ions doping.

         <title>Organic Single Crystal Actuators and Waveguides that Operate at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Applications in extreme conditions, such as those encountered in space exploration, require lightweight materials that can retain their elasticity in extremely cold environments. However, cryogenic treatment of most soft polymeric and elastomeric materials results in complete loss of their ability for elastic flow, whereby such materials that are normally ductile become stiff, brittle and prone to cracking. Here we report a facile method for preparation of hybrid organic crystalline materials that are not only cryogenically robust, but are also capable of large, recoverable and reversible deformation at low temperatures. To that end, flexible organic crystals were first mechanically reinforced by polymer coating and combined with a thermally responsive polymer. The resulting hybrid materials respond linearly and reversibly to temperatures from &#8722;15&#176;C to &#8722;120&#176;C without fatigue in air as well as in cold vacuum. The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that is inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost&#8208;effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low&#8208;temperature environmental settings.

         <title>A Redox Couple Strategy Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes by Suppressing Oxygen Release</title>

Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The poor cycling stability and fast voltage fading resulting from oxygen release during charging, however, severely hinder their practical application. Herein, a strategy of introducing an additional redox couple is first proposed to eliminate the persistent problem of oxygen release. As a proof of concept, the cycling stability of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, which is a typical LMRO cathode, is substantially enhanced with the help of the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple, and the capacity shows no decay with a retention of 100% after 700 cycles at 1C, far superior to the bare counterpart (61.7%). The surface peroxide ions (O22&#8722;) are readily chemically reduced back to immobile O2&#8722; by S2&#8722; during charging, accompanied by the formation of SO32&#8722;, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the oxygen lattice and eventually inhibiting the release of oxygen. More importantly, the S2&#8722; ions are regenerated during the following discharging process and participate in the chemical redox reaction again. Our findings shed light on a potential direction to tackle the poor cycling stability of high&#8208;energy anion&#8208;redox cathode materials for rechargeable metal&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Li- and Mn-rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next-generation high-energy lithium-ion batteries.

         <title>Heterojunction Annealing Enabling Record Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage in Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) thin&#8208;film solar cell has undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit still remains to be the biggest bottleneck as even the world record device suffers from a large VOC deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) was subjected to a post&#8208;annealing treatment using rapid thermal process. It was found that non&#8208;radiative recombination near the Sb2Se3/CdS HTJ including interface recombination and space charge region recombination were greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb2Se3/CdS thin&#8208;film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record VOC of 0.52&#160;V has been successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated VOC deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;Block Metals in Water Electrolysis: Status Quo and Perspectives</title>

Abstract
Transition metals, in particular noble metals, are the most common species in metal&#8208;mediated water electrolysis because they serve as highly active catalytic sites. In many cases, the presence of non&#8208;transition metals, that is, s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals with high natural abundance in the earth&#8208;crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline&#8208;earth metals, rare&#8208;earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these non&#8208;transition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments towards a knowledge&#8208;based catalyst design. In this review, we discuss five classes of non&#8208;transition metals species which were successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure&#8208;catalytic activity relationships and phase stability. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field have also been addressed in this account. We anticipate that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals species towards the discovery of advanced polymetal&#8208;containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stretchable and fast self&#8208;healing ionic hydrogel in cryogenic environments for artificial nerve fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials behave irreplaceable advantages in biomimetic intelligent robots (BIR) for avoiding or reducing safety hazards and economic losses from accidental damage during service. However, the self&#8208;healing ability is unreservedly lost and even becomes rigid, fragile in the cryogenic environment where BIR is precisely needed. Here, we report a versatile ionic hydrogel with fast self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and stable conductivity, even at &#8208;80&#8451;. The hydrogel is systematically optimized to improve hydrogen&#8208;bonded network nanostructure, coordinated achieving a quick self&#8208;healing ability within 10&#160;min, large deformation tolerance of over 7000%, superior conductivity of 11.76 S&#183;cm&#8211;1 and anti&#8208;freezing ability, which is difficult to obtain simultaneously. Such hydrogel provides new opportunities for artificial electronic devices in harsh environments. As a prospective application, we fabricate an artificial nerve fiber by mimicking the structure and functions of the myelinated axon, exhibiting the property of fast and potential&#8208;gated signal transmission. This artificial nerve fiber is integrated into a robot for demonstrating a real&#8208;time high fidelity and high throughput information interaction under big deformation and cryogenic temperature. The hydrogel and bionic device will bring pioneering functions for robots and open a broad application scenario in extreme conditions.

         <title>Hybrid Membrane&#8208;Decorated Prussian Blue for Effective Cancer Immunotherapy via Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages Polarization and Hypoxia Relief</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Both tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and hypoxia condition severely restrict the antitumor potency during cancer immunotherapy. It is essential to overcome the two issues for improving therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we built hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption to form Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ. It could facilitate cellular internalization via mannose&#8208;receptor mediated endocytosis and induce TAM polarization via iron ion/HCQ release with HMPB degradation. The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane was camouflaged on Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ surface, denoted as TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, to reduce in vivo reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake, enhance tumor accumulation and mitigate hypoxia. The in vivo results indicated that TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ notably inhibited tumor growth, induced TAM polarization, facilitated cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration and alleviated hypoxia microenvironment. The rational design may provide a new pathway to modulate TME for promoting cancer immunotherapy effects.

&lt;p&gt;Both tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and hypoxia condition severely restrict the antitumor potency during cancer immunotherapy. It is essential to overcome the two issues for improving therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we built hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption to form Man-HMPB/HCQ. It could facilitate cellular internalization via mannose-receptor mediated endocytosis and induce TAM polarization via iron ion/HCQ release with HMPB degradation. The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane was camouflaged on Man-HMPB/HCQ surface, denoted as TK-M@Man-HMPB/HCQ, to reduce in vivo reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake, enhance tumor accumulation and mitigate hypoxia. The in vivo results indicated that TK-M@Man-HMPB/HCQ notably inhibited tumor growth, induced TAM polarization, facilitated cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration and alleviated hypoxia microenvironment. The rational design may provide a new pathway to modulate TME for promoting cancer immunotherapy effects.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrically Programmable Interfacial Adhesion for Ultrastrong Hydrogel Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Adjustable interfacial adhesion is of great significance in smart hydrogel&#8208;related engineering fields. This study presents an electroadhesion strategy for universal and ultrastrong hydrogel bonding with electrically programmable strength. An ionic hydrogel containing lithium ions is designed to achieve hydrated ion diffusion&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, where external electric fields are employed to precisely control spatio&#8208;temporal dynamics of the ion diffusion across ionic adhesion region (IAR). The hydrogel can realize a universal, ultrastrong, efficient, tough, reversible and environmentally tolerant electroadhesion to diverse hydrogels, whose peak adhesion strength and interfacial adhesion toughness are as high as 1.2&#160;MPa and 3750 J m&#8211;2, respectively. With a mechanoelectric coupling model, the dominant role of the hydrated ions in IAR played in the interfacial electroadhesion is further quantitatively revealed. The proposed strategy opens a door for developing high&#8208;performance adhesion hydrogels with electrically programmable functions, which are indispensable for various emerging fields like flexible electronics and soft robotics.

         <title>A Minimalist Binary Vaccine Carrier for Personalized Postoperative Cancer Vaccine Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of minimalist vaccine carriers based on azole molecules&#8208;modified branched polyethylenimine is reported, which orchestrates the innate stimulating activity and antigen cross&#8208;presentation processes in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and achieves impressive personalized vaccine therapy results with the thus prepared binary vaccine.








Abstract
In recent years, significant evolutions have been made in applying nanotechnologies for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine design. However, the clinical translation of nanovaccines is still limited owing to their complicated compositions and difficulties in the spatiotemporal coordination of antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, a minimalist binary nanovaccine (BiVax) is designed that integrates innate stimulating activity into the carrier to elicit robust antitumor immunity. The authors started by making a series of azole molecules end&#8208;capped polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;M), and were&#160;surprised to find that over 60% of the PEI&#8208;M polymers have innate stimulating activity via activation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. PEI&#8208;4BImi, a PEI&#8208;M obtained from a series of polymers, elicits robust antitumor immune responses when used as a subcutaneously injected nanovaccine by simply mixing with ovalbumin antigens, and this BiVax system performs much better than the traditional ternary vaccine system, as well as, commercialized aluminum&#8208;containing adjuvants. This system also enables the fast preparation of personalized BiVax by compositing PEI&#8208;4BImi with autologous tumor cell membrane protein antigens, and a 60% postoperative cure rate is observed when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance In&#8208;Memory Photodetector Realized by Charge Storage in a van der Waals MISFET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;memory photodetector is successfully designed based on a WSe2/h&#8208;BN/SiO2 van der Waals heterostructure, which demonstrates not only an ultrahigh photoresponsivity (337.8 A W&#8722;1) but also an extremely long&#8208;term retention (&gt;10 years). Moreover, the working mechanism with charge&#8208;storage effect of the h&#8208;BN/SiO2 structure is proved through a novel in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy analysis.








Abstract
The emerging data&#8208;intensive applications in optoelectronics are driving innovation toward the fused integration of sensing, memory, and computing to break through the restrictions of the von Neumann architecture. However, the present photodetectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunctions required in single devices. Here, a novel route for the integration of non&#8208;volatile memory into a photodetector is proposed, with a WSe2/h&#8208;BN van der Waals heterostructure on a Si/SiO2 substrate to realize in&#8208;memory photodetection. This photodetector exhibits an ultrahigh readout photocurrent of 3.4 &#181;A and photoresponsivity of 337.8 A W&#8722;1 in the solar&#8208;blind wavelength region, together with an extended retention time of more than 10 years. Furthermore, the charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based non&#8208;volatile mechanism of h&#8208;BN/SiO2 is successfully proven through a novel analysis of in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. These results represent a leap forward to future applications and insightful mechanisms of in&#8208;memory photodetection.

         <title>Synthetic Matrix Scaffolds Engineer the In Vivo Tumor Immune Microenvironment for Immunotherapy Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor growth dynamics and reproducibility of preclinical breast cancer models are improved utilizing a system leveraging synthetic material scaffolds. These scaffolds induce reliable tumor formation and programmable immune infiltration based on composition, enabling enhanced consistency and relevance to human disease. Various immunotherapeutic strategies are tested, revealing differential efficacy based on immune milieu, demonstrating the promise to improve clinical immunotherapy applications.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most powerful anti&#8208;cancer therapies but is stymied by the limits of existing preclinical models with respect to disease latency and reproducibility. Additionally, the influence of differing immune microenvironments within tumors observed clinically and associated with immunotherapeutic resistance cannot be tuned to facilitate drug testing workflows without changing model system or laborious genetic approaches. To address this testing platform gap in the immune oncology drug development pipeline, the authors deploy engineered biomaterials as scaffolds to increase tumor formation rate, decrease disease latency, and diminish variability of immune infiltrates into tumors formed from murine mammary carcinoma cell lines implanted into syngeneic mice. By altering synthetic gel formulations that reshape infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, responsiveness of the same tumor model to varying classes of cancer immunotherapies, including in situ vaccination with a molecular adjuvant and immune checkpoint blockade, diverge. These results demonstrate the significant role the local immune microenvironment plays in immunotherapeutic response. These engineered tumor immune microenvironments therefore improve upon the limitations of current breast tumor models used for immune oncology drug screening to enable immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments underlying immunotherapeutic resistance seen in human patients.

         <title>A Universal Ternary&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Ink Strategy toward Efficient Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
An environmentally&#8208;friendly ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink system with excellent printability and film&#8208;forming ability is tailor&#8208;made for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). A record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs for the first time.








Abstract
Toward next&#8208;generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high&#8208;quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology toward practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX3) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs. With this tailor&#8208;made ternary halogen&#8208;free solvent (naphthene, n&#8208;tridecane, and n&#8208;nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX3 QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film&#8208;forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and n&#8208;tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43&#160;883.39&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system&#8208;based devices (EQE = 2.26%). Moreover, the ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet&#8208;printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)&#8208;based QLEDs. This work demonstrates a new strategy for tailor&#8208;making a general ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;QD&#8208;ink system for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs as well as the other solution&#8208;processed electronic devices in the future.

Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green technology to use ubiquitous and intermittent sunlight. The emerging S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress and provides new insights into its general designing criteria. It starts with the challenges confronted by single photocatalyst from the perspective of energy dissipation by borrowing the common behaviors in the dye molecule. Subsequently, other problems faced by single photocatalyst are summarized. Then a viable solution for these problems is the construction of heterojunctions. To overcome the problems and mistakes of type&#8208;II and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed and the underlying reaction mechanism is summarized. Afterward, the design principles for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Following this, direct characterization techniques for testifying the charge transfer in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are presented. Finally, different photocatalytic applications of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are summarized. Specifically, this work endeavors to clarify the critical understanding on curved Fermi level in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interface, which can help strengthen and advance the fundamental theories of photocatalysis. Moreover, the current challenges and prospects of the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst are critically discussed.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Efficient Sequential Drug Delivery of Biomimetic Nanosystem for Multimodal Chemo&#8208;, Antiangiogenic, and Anti&#8208;MDSC Therapy in Melanoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biomimetic DS@HLipo targets the tumor site, where near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeation triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib for both antiangiogenic therapy and anti&#8208;MDSC immunotherapy. The liberated doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) from the liposomes can then be more easily ingested by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy.








Abstract
In view of the multiple pathological hallmarks of tumors, nanosystems for the sequential delivery of various drugs whose targets are separately located inside and outside tumor cells are desired for improved cancer therapy. However, current sequential delivery is mainly achieved through enzyme&#8208; or acid&#8208;dependent degradation of the nanocarrier, which would be influenced by the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, and unloading efficiency of the drug acting on the target outside tumor cells is usually unsatisfactory. Here, a light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy based on a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) and free sunitinib in the aqueous cavity, is developed. The liposomal membrane is doped with photosensitizer porphyrin&#8211;phospholipid (PoP) and hybridized with red blood cell membrane to confer biomimetic features. Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeabilization triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib (100% release in 5&#160;min) for antiangiogenic therapy and also myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) inhibition to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Subsequently, the small&#8208;sized DOX&#8208;NP liberated from the liposomes is more easily uptaken by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy. RNA sequencing and immune&#8208;related assay indicates therapeutic immune enhancement. This light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy demonstrates the potency in cancer multimodal therapy against multiple targets in different spatial positions in tumor microenvironment.

         <title>2D FeP Nanoframe Superlattices via Space&#8208;Confined Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are designed and synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess a number of unique features unavailable in conventional nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly promising as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled nanocrystal superlattices represent an emergent class of designer materials with potentially programmable functionalities. The ability to construct hierarchically structured nanocrystal superlattices with tailored geometry and porosity is critical for extending their applications. Here, 2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach induced by the Kirkendall effect, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The particle shape and the close&#8208;packed nature of Fe3O4 nanocubes as well as the interconnected carbon layer network contribute to the topochemical transformation process. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess several unique and advantageous structural features that are unavailable in conventional 3D nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly attractive for catalytic applications. As a proof of concept, such 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices are harnessed as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, the performance of which is superior to that of most FeP&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. This topochemical transformation approach is scalable and general, representing a new route of designing hierarchical superlattices with highly open features that cannot be accessible by traditional self&#8208;assembly methods.

The PDI&#8208;NH performs a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), exceeding most of photocatalysts. The high crystallinity of PDI&#8208;NH ensures the built&#8208;in electric field, acting as a kinetic force to promote the charge separation.








Abstract
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is synthesized via imidazole solvent method. The catalyst shows a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) with apparent quantum yield of 10.4% at 400&#160;nm, which is 1353 times higher than the low crystalline PDI&#8208;NH. The highly crystalline structure comes from the ordered self&#8208;assembly process in molten imidazole solvent via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding. Further, the excellent performance ascribes to the robust built&#8208;in electric field induced by its high crystallinity, which greatly accelerates the charge separation and transfer. What is more, the PDI&#8208;NH is quite stable and can be reused over 50 h without performance attenuation. Briefly, the crystalline PDI&#8208;NH with strong built&#8208;in electric field throws light on photocatalytic oxygen evolution, showing a new perspective for the design of organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Fabrication of Stretchable Superamphiphobic Surfaces with Deformation&#8208;Induced Rearrangeable Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable and durable superamphiphobic surface is fabricated by a simple and low&#8208;cost spray&#8208;coating method. Low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids can easily slide off the surface, even when the tensile strain of the surface is &#8805;225%.








Abstract
Stretchable superamphiphobic surfaces with a high deformation resistance are in demand to achieve liquid&#8208;repellent performance in flexible electronics, artificial skin, and textile dressings. However, it is challenging to make mechanically robust superamphiphobic coatings, which maintain their superliquid repellency in a highly stretched state. Here, a stretchable superamphiphobic surface is reported, on which the microstructures can rearrange during stretching to maintain a stable superamphiphobicity even under a high tensile strain. The surface is prepared by spray&#8208;coating silicone nanofilaments onto a prestretched substrate (e.g., cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polyisoprene) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layer as a binder. After subsequent fluorination, this surface keeps its superamphiphobicity to both water and n&#8208;hexadecane up to the tensile strain of at least 225%. The binding PDMS layer and rearrangeable structures maximize the deformation resistance of the surface during the stretching process. The superamphiphobicity and morphology of the surface are maintained even after 1000 stretch&#8211;release cycles. Taking advantage of the mentioned benefits, a liquid manipulation system is designed, which has the potential for fabricating reusable and low&#8208;cost platforms for biochemical detection and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>Engineering Radiosensitizer&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Advanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy suffers from high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome these limitations, a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network is engineered to achieve a synergy of radiosensitization and stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation. This tactic promotes dendritic cell maturation and evokes potent systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a mainstay of first&#8208;line cancer treatment, suffers from its high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The synergy between radiosensitization and immunomodulation may overcome these obstacles for advanced radiotherapy. Here, the authors propose a radiosensitization cooperated with stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway activation strategy by fabricating a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network, NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4@PEG&#8208;polyphenol/Mn (DSPM). The amphiphilic PEG&#8208;polyphenol successfully coordinates with NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4 (radiosensitizer) and Mn2+ via robust metal&#8208;phenolic coordination. After cell internalization, the pH&#8208;responsive disassembly of DSPM triggers the release of their payloads, wherein radiosensitizer sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray and Mn2+ promote STING pathway activation. This radiosensitizer&#8208;based DSPM remarkably benefits dendritic cell maturation, anticancer therapeutics in primary tumors, accompanied by robust systemic immune therapeutic performance against metastatic tumors. Therefore, a powerful radiosensitization with STING pathway activation mediated immunostimulation strategy is highlighted here to optimize cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Growth of Amorphous Discharge Products toward an Ultrawide Band Light&#8208;Assisted Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for an ultrawide band photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed. The bifunctional Ag/Bi2MoO6 cathode is favorable to promoting the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics due to the discharge products is amorphous Li2O2. The reaction mechanism is revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. 








Abstract
Photoassisted electrochemical reaction is regarded as an effective approach to reduce the overpotential of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. However, the achievement of both broadband absorption and long term battery cycling stability are still a formidable challenge. Herein, an oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for a photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed with a silver/bismuth molybdate (Ag/Bi2MoO6) hybrid cathode. The cathode can offer both double advantages for light absorption covering UV to visible region and excellent electrochemical activity for O2. Upon discharging, the photoexcited electrons from Ag nanoplate based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are injected into the oxygen vacancy in Bi2MoO6. The fast oxygen reaction kinetics generate the amorphous Li2O2, and the discharge plateau is improved to 3.05&#160;V. Upon charging, the photoexcited holes are capable to decompose amorphous Li2O2 promptly, yielding a very low charge plateau of 3.25&#160;V. A first cycle round&#8208;trip efficiency is 93.8% and retention of 70% over 500 h, which is the longest cycle life ever reported in photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries. This work offers a general and reliable strategy for boosting the electrochemical kinetics by tailoring the crystalline of Li2O2 with wide&#8208;band light.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Solar Cells for Building Integrated Photovoltaics: Transforming Building Fa&#231;ades into Power Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase solar production in city centers, one either needs to increase the power generation per unit area or increase the harvesting area by utilizing the building fa&#231;ade for solar electricity generation. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) appear to be an ideal solution for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which transforms windows or fa&#231;ades into electric power generators.








Abstract
The rapid emergence of organic&#8211;inorganic lead halide perovskites for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics promises to impact new photovoltaic concepts. Their high power conversion efficiencies, ability to coat perovskite layers on glass via various scalable deposition techniques, excellent optoelectronic properties, and synthetic versatility for modulating transparency and color allow perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to be an ideal solution for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which transforms windows or fa&#231;ades into electric power generators. In this review, the unique features and properties of PSCs for BIPV application are accessed. Device engineering and optical management strategies of active layers, interlayers, and electrodes for semitransparent, bifacial, and colorful PSCs are also discussed. The performance of PSCs under conditions that are relevant for BIPV such as different operational temperature, light intensity, and light incident angle are also reviewed. Recent outdoor stability testing of PSCs in different countries and other demonstration of scalability and deployment of PSCs are also spotlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for realizing perovskite&#8208;based BIPV are discussed.

In this review, the unique features and properties of PSCs for BIPV application are accessed. Device engineering and optical management strategies of active layers, interlayers, and electrodes for semitransparent, bifacial, and colorful PSCs are also discussed. The performance of PSCs under conditions that are relevant for BIPV such as different operational temperature, light intensity, and light incident angle are also reviewed. Recent outdoor stability testing of PSCs in different countries and other demonstration of scalability and deployment of PSCs are also spotlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for realizing perovskite-based BIPV are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Blind ZnMgO Colloidal Quantum Dot Downconverters Expand Silicon CMOS Sensors Spectral Coverage into Ultraviolet and Enable UV&#8208;Band Discrimination</title>

         <dc:description>
A nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based downconverting thin&#8208;film technology that offers a ninefold enhancement in the UV sensitivity of a silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor sensor without deteriorating its performance in the visible and near&#8208;infrared is reported. Additionally, a tandem stack of such QDs is reported, which enables UV&#8208;band discrimination in a cost effective and facile manner.








Abstract
Selective spectral detection of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is highly important across numerous fields from health and safety to industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Herein, a nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind, quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based sensing scheme that expands the spectral coverage of silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) sensors into the UV, enabling efficient UV detection without affecting the sensor performance in the visible and UV&#8208;band discrimination, is reported. This scheme uses zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) QDs with compositionally tunable absorption across UV and high photoluminescence quantum yield in the visible. The efficient luminescence and large Stokes shift of these QDs are exploited herein to act as an efficient downconverting material that enhances the UV sensitivity of Si&#8208;photodetectors (Si&#8208;PDs). A Si&#8208;PD integrated with the QDs results in a ninefold improvement in photoresponsivity from 0.83 to 7.5&#160;mA W&#8722;1 at 260&#160;nm. Leveraging the tunability of these QDs, a simple UV&#8208;band identification scheme is further reported, which uses two distinct&#8208;bandgap ZnMgO QDs stacked in a tandem architecture whose spectral emission color depends on the UV&#8208;band excitation light. The downconverting stack enables facile discrimination of UV light using a standard CMOS image sensor (camera) or by the naked eye and avoids the use of complex optics.

         <title>PEG&#8208;Like Brush Polymer Conjugate of RNA Aptamer That Shows Reversible Anticoagulant Activity and Minimal Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a path is offered to rescuing RNA therapeutics from the deleterious immune side effects of PEG that induces life&#8208;threatening hypersensitivity reactions upon reactivity toward PEG antibodies using a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like stealth polymer conjugate technology. These results breathe new life into an established and valuable drug delivery technology facing an impasse.








Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics are an emerging class of drugs. RNA aptamers are of significant therapeutic and clinical interest because their activity can be easily reversed in vivo&#8212;a useful feature that is difficult to achieve using other therapeutic modalities. Despite their therapeutic promise, RNA aptamers are limited by their poor blood circulation. The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to RNA aptamers addresses this limitation. However, an RNA aptamer&#8208;PEG conjugate that is a reversible anticoagulant fails in a clinical trial due to the reactivity of the conjugate with pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies and has cast a pall over PEGylation of aptamers and other biologics, despite its long history of utility in drug delivery. Here, PEG antibody&#8208;reactivity of this RNA aptamer is eliminated by conjugating it to a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like brush polymer&#8212;poly[(oligoethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)] (POEGMA). The conjugate retained the drug's therapeutic action and the ability to be easily reversed. Importantly, this conjugate does not bind pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies that are prevalent in humans and does not induce a humoral immune response against the polymer itself in mice. These findings suggest a path to rescuing the PEGylation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines from the deleterious side&#8208;effects of PEG.

         <title>Design Rules of a Sulfur Redox Electrocatalyst for Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Seeking an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides to insoluble products is crucial to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and thus increase their practical energy density. We have used Mn&#8208;based mullite (SmMn2O5) as a model catalyst for the sulfur redox reaction to show how the design rules involving lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection improve catalyst performance. Theoretical simulation shows that the positions of Mn and O active sites on the (001) surface, are a good match with those of Li and S atoms in polysulfides, resulting in their tight anchoring to each other. Fundamentally, dz2 and dx2&#8208;y2 around the Fermi level are found to be crucial for strongly coupling with the p&#8208;orbitals of the polysulfides and thus decreasing the redox overpotential. Following the theoretical calculation, SmMn2O5 catalyst has been synthesized and used as an interlayer in a Li&#8208;S battery. The resulted battery has a high cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 0.5 C and more promisingly a high areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved with a sulfur loading of &#8764;5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 under a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) value &#8764;4.6&#160;&#956;L mg&#8211;1 condition.

         <title>2D FeOCl: A Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor Synthesized via Temperature&#8208;Oscillation Chemical Vapor Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) transition&#8208;metal oxyhalides with low symmetry, novel magnetism, and good stability provide a versatile platform for conducting fundamental research and developing spintronics. Antiferromagnetic FeOCl has attracted significant interest owing to its unique semiconductor properties and relatively high N&#233;el temperature. Herein, good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized using the universal temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport (TO&#8208;CVT) method. The crystal structure, bandgap, and anisotropic behavior of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. The absorption spectrum and electrical measurements reveal that 2D FeOCl is a semiconductor with an optical bandgap of &#8764;2.1&#160;eV and a resistivity of &#8764;10&#8211;1 &#937;&#183;m at 295 K, and the bandgap increases with decreasing thickness. Strong in&#8208;plane optical and electrical anisotropies are observed in 2D FeOCl flakes, and the maximum resistance anisotropic ratio reaches 2.66 at 295 K. Additionally, the lattice vibration modes are studied through temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectra and first&#8208;principles density functional calculations. A significant decrease in the Raman frequencies below the N&#233;el temperature is observed, which results from the strong spin&#8208;phonon coupling effect in 2D FeOCl. This study provides a high&#8208;quality low&#8208;symmetry vdW magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronics.

         <title>Bioinspired Five&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozyme for Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) represent a new research frontier in the biomedical fields. The rational design and controllable synthesis of SAzymes with well&#8208;defined electronic and geometric structures are essential for maximizing their enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity and therapeutic efficacy but remain challenging. Here we first report a melamine&#8208;mediated pyrolysis activation strategy for the controllable fabrication of iron&#8208;based SAzyme containing five&#8208;coordinated structure (FeN5), identified by transmission electron microscopy imaging and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses. The FeN5 SAzyme exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity owing to the optimized coordination structure, and the corresponding catalytic efficiency of Fe&#8208;species in FeN5 SAzyme is 7.64 and 3.45 &#215; 105 times higher than those in traditional FeN4 SAzyme and Fe3O4 nanozyme, respectively, demonstrated by steady&#8208;state kinetic assay. In addition, the catalytic mechanism is jointly disclosed by experimental results and density functional theory studies. The as&#8208;synthesized FeN5 SAzyme demonstrates significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo due to the excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity under tumor microenvironment.

         <title>High&#8208;Z Sensitized Radiotherapy Synergizes with the Intervention of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway for In Situ Tumor Vaccination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In situ tumor vaccination has been preliminarily pursued to strengthen anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Immunogenic tumor cell death would spontaneously release abundant antigens and adjuvants for activation of dendritic cells (DCs), providing a paragon opportunity for establishing efficient in situ vaccination. Herein, we construct Phy@PLGdH nanosheets by integrating Physcion (Phy, an inhibitor of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) with layered gadolinium hydroxide nanosheets (PLGdH nanosheets) to boost Radiation Therapy (RT)&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for potent in situ tumor vaccination. We first observe that sheet&#8208;like PLGdH could present superior X&#8208;ray deposition and tumor penetrability, exhibiting improved Radio&#8208;sensitization in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the destruction of cellular NADPH and nucleotide homeostasis by Phy&#8208;mediated PPP intervention could further amplify PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage, which correspondingly result in effective ICD and enhance the immunogenicity of irradiated tumor cells. Consequently, Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT successfully primes robust CD8+ T cell dependent antitumor immunity to potentiate checkpoint blockade immunotherapies against primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;Derivative Decorated Hierarchical Porous Host Enabling Ultrahigh Rates and Superior Long&#8208;Term Cycling of Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their high intrinsic capacity, high safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, uncontrollable dendrite growth and adverse side reactions of Zn anodes seriously hinder their further application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous graphene&#8208;carbon nanotubes scaffold decorated with metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derived ZnO/C nanoparticles (3D&#8208;ZGC) is fabricated as the host for dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal composite anodes. The zincophilic ZnO/C nanoparticles act as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to induce homogeneous Zn deposition. The mechanically robust 3D scaffold with high conductivity not only suppresses the formation of dendritic Zn by reducing the local current density and homogenizing Zn2+ ion flux, but also inhibits volume changes during the long&#8208;term plating/stripping process. As a result, the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anodes afford unprecedented Zn plating&#8208;stripping stability at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for 1500 cycles with low overpotential (&lt;65&#160;mV) when used in a symmetric cell. When coupled with MnO2 cathodes, the assembled Zn@3D&#8208;ZGC//MnO2 full batteries deliver an enhanced cycling stability for up to 6000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8211;1, demonstrating the potential of the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anode for advanced Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Synergistic Disruption of Metabolic Homeostasis through Hyperbranched Poly(ethylene glycol) Conjugates as Nanotherapeutics to Constrain Cancer Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanotherapeutic is presented for combination therapy through controllable co&#8208;delivery of doxorubicin and pyropheophorbide&#8208;a using nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) co&#8208;assembled from two hyperbranched polymer&#8208;based conjugates (HP&#8208;P and HP&#8208;D). The demonstrated tumor suppression effect can result from the reduced protein translation due to disruption of metabolic homeostasis as evidenced by metabolic variations.








Abstract
Combination therapy is a promising approach for effective treatment of tumors through synergistically regulating pathways. However, the synergistic effect is limited, likely by uncontrolled co&#8208;delivery of different therapeutic payloads in a single nanoparticle. Herein, a combination nanotherapeutic is developed by using two amphiphilic conjugates, hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) (HP&#8208;P) and hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;doxorubicin (DOX) (HP&#8208;D) to construct co&#8208;assembly nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) for controllably co&#8208;loading and co&#8208;delivering Ppa and DOX. In vitro and in vivo antitumor studies confirm the synergistic effect of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy from HP&#8208;PD NPs. Metabolic variations reveal that tumor suppression is associated with disruption of metabolic homeostasis, leading to reduced protein translation. This study uncovers the manipulation of metabolic changes in tumor cells through disruption of cellular homeostasis using HP&#8208;PD NPs and provides a new insight into the rational design of synergistic nanotherapeutics for combination therapy.

         <title>Modulating Tumor Extracellular Matrix by Simultaneous Inhibition of Two Cancer Cell Receptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin pathways with recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates treatment improves the tumor accumulation and cellular internalization of drug through regulating the F&#8208;actin content in cancer cells and extracellular matrix in the tumor environments as well as the physical environment of tumors, leading to an improved tumor therapy compared to free drug.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in fundamental cellular processes and pathological progression of many diseases. While most research and current knowledge focuses on the processes of biological and mechanical changes in ECM signaling residing cancer cells to respond, little is known of the converse&#8211;of how cancer cells initiate the changes of ECM properties. Here, it is reported that blocking the cancer cell signaling leads to disruption of tumor ECM. Using recombinant proteins (RPs) and recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates (RPDCs) that simultaneously target both epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin, it is demonstrated that multireceptor&#8208;mediated active modulation of tumor ECM can inhibit and even reverse tumor remodeling of the physiological and structural microenvironment. These results not only provide insights into the regulatory roles of cancer cells in developing a protumoral microenvironment, but also introduce a new therapeutic platform or strategy to treat cancers.

         <title>A Stiffness&#8208;Switchable, Biomimetic Smart Material Enabled by Supramolecular Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stiffness&#8208;changing biomimetic smart material is developed through a unique water&#8211;ethanol solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;induced supramolecular reconfiguration strategy. The dynamic switchable supramolecular network imparts the material with an interesting self&#8208;regulation behavior in mechanical properties between soft and hard states, self&#8208;healing capability, and excellent formability, which holds great application potential in smart buildings, personal protection devices, soft robots, intelligent devices, and beyond.








Abstract
In nature, stiffness&#8208;changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials. Here, a stiffness&#8208;changing smart material, through developing interchangeable supramolecular configurations inspired from the dermis of the sea cucumber, which shows extreme, switchable mechanical properties, is reported.

&lt;p&gt;A stiffness-changing biomimetic smart material is developed through a unique water&#8211;ethanol solvent-exchange-induced supramolecular reconfiguration strategy. The dynamic switchable supramolecular network imparts the material with an interesting self-regulation behavior in mechanical properties between soft and hard states, self-healing capability, and excellent formability, which holds great application potential in smart buildings, personal protection devices, soft robots, intelligent devices, and beyond.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, stiffness-changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials. Here, a stiffness-changing smart material, through developing interchangeable supramolecular configurations inspired from the dermis of the sea cucumber, which shows extreme, switchable mechanical properties, is reported. In the hydrated state, the material, possessing a stretched, double-stranded supramolecular network, showcases a soft-gel behavior with a low stiffness and high pliability. Upon the stimulation of ethanol to transform into the coiled supramolecular configuration, it self-adjusts to a hard state with nearly 500-times enhanced stiffness from 0.51&#160;to 243.6&#160;MPa, outstanding load-bearing capability (over 35&#160;000&#160;times its own weight), and excellent puncture/impact resistance with a specific impact strength of &#8776;116&#160;kJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (g&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (higher than some metals and alloys such as aluminum, and even comparable to the commercially available protective materials such as D3O and Kevlar). Moreover, this material demonstrates reconfiguration-dependent self-healing behavior and designable formability, holding great promise in advanced engineering fields that require both high-strength durability and good formability.

         <title>Nonvolatile Ferroelectric&#8208;Domain&#8208;Wall Memory Embedded in a Complex Topological Domain Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype memory based on conductive ferroelectric domain&#8208;walls confined in a topological quadrant domain is demonstrated, which exhibits a resistive&#8208;switching characteristic with a large on/off ratio &gt;104&#160;and high readout current, as well as an excellent endurance over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention over 12&#160;days.








Abstract
The discovery and precise manipulation of atomic&#8208;size conductive ferroelectric domain walls offers new opportunities for a wide range of prospective electronic devices, and the emerging field of walltronics. Herein, a highly stable and fatigue&#8208;resistant nonvolatile memory device is demonstrated, which is based on deterministic creation and erasure of conductive domain walls that are geometrically confined in a topological domain structure. By introducing a pair of delicately designed coaxial electrodes onto the epitaxial BiFeO3&#160;film, a center&#8208;type quadrant topological domain with conductive charged domain walls can be easily created. More importantly, reversible switching of the quadrant domain between the convergent state with highly conductive confined walls and the divergent state with insulating confined walls can be realized, resulting in an apparent resistance change with a large on/off ratio of &gt;104&#160;and a technically preferred readout current (up to 40&#160;nA). Owing to restrictions from the clamped quadrant ferroelastic domain, the device exhibits excellent restoration repeatability over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention of over 12&#160;days (&gt;106&#160;s). These results provide a new pathway toward high&#8208;performance ferroelectric&#8208;domain&#8208;wall memory, which may spur extensive interest in exploring the immense potential in the emerging field of walltronics.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Nanophotonic Structures for High&#8208;Performance SEIRA Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of high&#8208;performance nanophotonic surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) sensor employing liquid gallium as the ground plane of nanopatch antennas is demonstrated. Superior performance for sensing thin analyte films such as monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol is achieved. The developed cost&#8208;effective procedure for realizing such liquid&#8208;gallium&#8208;based nanophotonic SEIRA sensors is suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy can provide label&#8208;free, nondestructive detection and identification of analytes with high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore has been widely used for various sensing applications. SEIRA sensors usually employ resonant nanophotonic structures, which can substantially enhance the electric field and hence light&#8211;matter interactions by orders of magnitude in certain nanoscale hot spots of the devices. However, as ever, smaller hot spots are employed to further enhance the field, the delivery of analytes into such hot spots becomes increasingly challenging. Here, high&#8208;performance nanophotonic SEIRA sensors based on nanopatch antennas with a liquid gallium ground plane are demonstrated, which not only lead to ultrahigh field confinement and enhancement, but also allow for convenient and efficient delivery of analytes into nanometric hot spots by employing a simple procedure suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The sensors exhibit superior sensitivity in the midinfrared spectral region. Around 10% molecular vibrational signals (i.e., the modulation of a sensor's reflection spectrum owing to the molecular vibrational modes of the analytes) near 2900&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;are achieved from sensing monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol. This cost&#8208;effective and reliable method for realizing liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanophotonic structures provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance sensors and other photonics applications in the infrared region.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Anode with an Exceptional Cycling&#8208;Induced Capacity Enhancement for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZIF glass (melt&#8208;quench Co ZIF&#8208;62 glass), for the first time, is evaluated as anode for high performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This ZIF glass anode exhibits an unusual capacity enhancement during charge&#8208;discharge cycling. This exceptional phenomenon is related to the unique structure of ZIF glass, e.g., short&#8208;range disorder.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high&#8208;energy anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium&#8208;ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it is fabricated by melt&#8208;quenching Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 (Co(Im)1.75(bIm)0.25) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&#8722;1), outstanding cycling stability, and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 and the amorphous one prepared by high&#8208;energy ball&#8208;milling. Importantly, it is found that the Li&#8208;ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge&#8211;discharge cycling and even tripled after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, reveal the origin of the cycling&#8208;induced enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, the increased distortion and local breakage of the Co&#63743;N coordination bonds making the Li&#8208;ion intercalation sites more accessible.

         <title>Oxide/ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Nanofiber Yarns: Heightened Surface Activity for Exceptional Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional chemiresistive gas sensor composed of nanofiber yarn sputter&#8208;deposited with indium tin oxide (ITO) as a sensing layer is designed, and then coated with zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for nanofiltration of gas analytes. Through comprehensive sensing experiments and molecular modeling, it is demonstrated that yarn@ITO@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits highly sensitive and selective sensing properties toward NO at room temperature with accelerated responding speeds.








Abstract
Though highly promising as powerful gas sensors, oxide semiconductor chemiresistors have low surface reactivity, which limits their selectivity, sensitivity, and reaction kinetics, particularly at room temperature (RT) operation. It is proposed that a hybrid design involving the nanostructuring of oxides and passivation with selective gas filtration layers can potentially overcome the issues with surface activity. Herein, unique bi&#8208;stacked heterogeneous layers are introduced; that is, nanostructured oxides covered by conformal nanoporous gas filters, on ultrahigh&#8208;density nanofiber (NF) yarns via sputter deposition with indium tin oxide (ITO) and subsequent self&#8208;assembly of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals. The NF yarn composed of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;coated ITO films can offer heightened surface activity at RT because of high porosity, large surface area, and effective screening of interfering gases. As a case study, the hybrid sensor demonstrated remarkable sensing performances characterized by high NO selectivity, fast response/recovery kinetics (&gt;60&#8208;fold improvement), and large responses (12.8&#8208;fold improvement @ 1&#160;ppm) in comparison with pristine yarn@ITO, especially under highly humid conditions. Molecular modeling reveals an increased penetration ratio of NO over O2 to the ITO surface, indicating that NO oxidation is reliably prevented and that the secondary adsorption sites provided by the ZIF&#8208;8 facilitate the adsorption/desorption of NO, both to and from ITO.

Through comprehensive sensing experiments and molecular modeling, it is demonstrated that yarn@ITO@ZIF-8 exhibits highly sensitive and selective sensing properties toward NO at room temperature with accelerated responding speeds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though highly promising as powerful gas sensors, oxide semiconductor chemiresistors have low surface reactivity, which limits their selectivity, sensitivity, and reaction kinetics, particularly at room temperature (RT) operation. It is proposed that a hybrid design involving the nanostructuring of oxides and passivation with selective gas filtration layers can potentially overcome the issues with surface activity. Herein, unique bi-stacked heterogeneous layers are introduced; that is, nanostructured oxides covered by conformal nanoporous gas filters, on ultrahigh-density nanofiber (NF) yarns via sputter deposition with indium tin oxide (ITO) and subsequent self-assembly of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) nanocrystals. The NF yarn composed of ZIF-8-coated ITO films can offer heightened surface activity at RT because of high porosity, large surface area, and effective screening of interfering gases. As a case study, the hybrid sensor demonstrated remarkable sensing performances characterized by high NO selectivity, fast response/recovery kinetics (&amp;gt;60-fold improvement), and large responses (12.8-fold improvement @ 1&#160;ppm) in comparison with pristine yarn@ITO, especially under highly humid conditions. Molecular modeling reveals an increased penetration ratio of NO over O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the ITO surface, indicating that NO oxidation is reliably prevented and that the secondary adsorption sites provided by the ZIF-8 facilitate the adsorption/desorption of NO, both to and from ITO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Oligomer Enables Green Solvent Processed 17.5% Ternary Organic Solar Cells: Synergistic Energy Loss Reduction and Morphology Fine&#8208;Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low energy loss ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve significantly improved power conversion efficiencies of 17.54% and 17.32% by introducing novel oligomers with higher HOMO level as third&#8208;components, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs by green solvent. The significance of high electroluminescence quantum efficiency is highlighted and new understanding of energy loss mechanisms is provided toward high&#8208;performance, ecofriendly OSCs.








Abstract
The large non&#8208;radiative recombination is the main factor that limits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two novel structurally similar oligomers (named 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D and A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration are synthesized for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination in OSCs. Although the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers enabled ultra&#8208;high electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of 0.05% and improved VOC, indicating suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP&#8208;BO4Cl fine&#8208;tunes the active layer morphology with synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTPBO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art OSCs processed by green solvent of o&#8208;xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance in ternary OSCs. This is the first work that demonstrates novel structurally compatible D&#8208;A type oligomers are effective third components, and provides new understanding of synergetic energy loss mechanisms towards high performance OSCs.

Abstract
Reconfiguring the structure and selectivity of existing chemotherapeutics represents an opportunity for developing novel tumor&#8208;selective drugs. Here; we demonstrate; as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept; the use of high&#8208;frequency sound waves to transform the non&#8208;selective anthracycline doxorubicin into a tumor selective drug molecule. The transformed drug self&#8208;aggregates in water to form &#8764;200&#160;nm nanodrugs; without requiring organic solvents; chemical agents and surfactants. The nanodrugs preferentially interact with lipid rafts; abundant in the mitochondria of cancer cells. The mitochondrial localization of the nanodrugs plays a key role in inducing reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated selective death of human breast cancer; colorectal carcinoma; ovarian carcinoma and drug&#8208;resistant cell lines. Only marginal cytotoxicity (80&#8208;100% cell viability) towards fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes is observed; even after administration of high doses of the nanodrug (25&#8208;40&#160;&#956;g/mL). Penetration; cytotoxicity and selectivity of the nanodrugs in tumor mimicking tissues are validated by using a 3D co&#8208;culture of cancer and healthy cells and 3D cell&#8208;collagen constructs in a perfusion bioreactor. The nanodrugs exhibit tropism for lung and limited accumulation in the liver and spleen; as suggested by in vivo biodistribution studies. Our results highlight the potential of this approach to transform the structure and bioactivity of commercial anticancer drugs and antibiotics bearing sono&#8208;active moieties.

         <title>Assembly of Bioactive Nanoparticles via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Complexation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and tunable strategy is developed to assemble a range of biomacromolecules into bioactive metal&#8211;phenolic nanoparticles (b&#8208;MPN NPs), while retaining the intrinsic activity of the biomacromolecules. The bioactivity of the b&#8208;MPN NPs enables their use in various applications, including cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, cascade reactions, and gene silencing.








Abstract
The integration of bioactive materials (e.g., proteins and genes) into nanoparticles holds promise in fields ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. However, it is challenging to develop a simple and broadly applicable nanoparticle platform that can readily incorporate distinct biomacromolecules without affecting their intrinsic activity. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic assembly approach is presented whereby diverse functional nanoparticles can be readily assembled in water by combining various synthetic and natural building blocks, including poly(ethylene glycol), phenolic ligands, metal ions, and bioactive macromolecules. The assembly process is primarily mediated by metal&#8211;phenolic complexes through coordination and hydrophobic interactions, which yields uniform and spherical nanoparticles (mostly &lt;200&#160;nm),&#160;while preserving the function of the incorporated biomacromolecules (siRNA and five different proteins used). The functionality of the assembled nanoparticles is demonstrated through cancer cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, catalysis, and gene downregulation studies. Furthermore, the resulting nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for the secondary engineering of superstructures via templating and cross&#8208;linking with metal ions. The bioactivity and versatility of the platform can potentially be used for the streamlined and rational design of future bioactive materials.

         <title>Active and Passive Tuning of Ultranarrow Resonances in Polaritonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field nanoscopy monitors active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas over a wide spectral range (&#8722;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1). Passive tunability can be realized by tailoring the dielectric environment of nanoantennas made of boron nitride, while reversible in situ tuning of narrow resonances is realized by placing nanoantennas on top of a graphene layer.








Abstract
Optical nanoantennas are of great importance for photonic devices and spectroscopy due to their capability of squeezing light at the nanoscale and enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions. Among them, nanoantennas made of polar crystals supporting phonon polaritons (phononic nanoantennas) exhibit the highest quality factors. This is due to the low optical losses inherent in these materials, which, however, hinder the spectral tuning of the nanoantennas due to their dielectric nature. Here, active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas is realized over a wide spectral range (&#8776;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1), monitored by near&#8208;field nanoscopy. To do that, the local environment of a single nanoantenna made of hexagonal boron nitride is modified by placing it on different polar substrates, such as quartz and 4H&#8208;silicon carbide, or covering it with layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index van der Waals crystal (WSe2). Importantly, active tuning of the nanoantenna polaritonic resonances is demonstrated by placing it on top of a gated graphene monolayer in which the Fermi energy is varied. This work presents the realization of tunable polaritonic nanoantennas with ultranarrow resonances, which can find applications in active nanooptics and (bio)sensing.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Treatment for Highest&#8208;Efficiency Ambient Printed Stable All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (EMIMHSO4), is employed for managing defects in printed cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) films. The EMIMHSO4 can succesfully regulate perovskite thin&#8208;film growth and strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+, which enable the achievement of the highest&#8208;efficiencies ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells, both under 1 sun illumination (20.01%, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and indoor light illumination (37.24%, 1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite is well known for its unparalleled stability at high temperatures up to 500 &#176;C and under oxidative chemical stresses. However, upscaling solar cells via ambient printing suffers from imperfect crystal quality and defects caused by uncontrollable crystallization. Here, the incorporation of a low concentration of novel ionic liquid is reported as being promising for managing defects in CsPbI3 films, interfacial energy alignment, and device stability of solar cells fabricated via ambient blade&#8208;coating. Both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements reveal that the ionic liquid successfully regulates the perovskite thin&#8208;film growth to decrease perovskite grain boundaries, strongly coordinates with the undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to decrease the energy barrier at the electron&#8208;transporting layer, and relaxes the lattice strain to promote phase stability. Consequently, ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells with power conversion efficiency as high as 20.01% under 1 sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and 37.24% under indoor light illumination (1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) are achieved; both are the highest for printed all&#8208;inorganic cells for corresponding applications. Furthermore, the bare cells show an impressive long&#8208;term ambient stability with only &#8776;5% PCE degradation after 1000 h aging under ambient conditions.

         <title>Bioinspired lipoproteins of furoxans&#8208;oxaliplatin remodels physical barriers in tumor to potentiate T&#8208;cell infiltration</title>

Abstract
The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we synthesized a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8208;oxaliplatin (FO) and designed a stroma cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S&#8208;LFO), aiming to facilitate CTLs infiltration in tumors for anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. S&#8208;LFO treatment significantly promoted tumor vessel normalization and eliminated multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96&#8208;, 5.02&#8208; and 8.65&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells, their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and granzyme B&#8208;expressing sub&#8208;types when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S&#8208;LFO with an anti&#8208;programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (aPD&#8208;L1) produced notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extended survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTLs infiltration for anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anti-cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we synthesized a reduction-sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans-oxaliplatin (FO) and designed a stroma cell-accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S-LFO), aiming to facilitate CTLs infiltration in tumors for anti-cancer immunotherapy. S-LFO treatment significantly promoted tumor vessel normalization and eliminated multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96-, 5.02- and 8.65-fold increase of CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, their interferon-&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;- and granzyme B-expressing sub-types when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S-LFO with an anti-programmed death ligand-1 (aPD-L1) produced notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extended survivals in three murine tumor models.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Epitaxial Ferroelectric Oxide Nano&#8208;spring with Super&#8208;scalability</title>

Abstract
Oxide nano&#8208;springs have attracted many research interests because of their anti&#8208;corrosion, high&#8208;temperature tolerance, oxidation resistance, and enhanced&#8208;mechanic&#8208;response from unique helix structures, enabling various nano&#8208;manipulators, nano&#8208;motors, nano&#8208;switches, sensors, and energy harvesters. However, preparing oxide nano&#8208;springs is a challenge for their intrinsic lack of elasticity. Here, we developed an approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled, epitaxial, ferroelectric nano&#8208;springs with built&#8208;in strain due to the lattice mismatch in freestanding La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 (LSMO/BTO) bilayer heterostructures. We find that these LSMO/BTO nano&#8208;springs can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometry limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under co&#8208;existing axial and shear strains. In addition, the oxide hetero&#8208;structural springs exhibit strong resilience due to the limited plastic deformation nature and the built&#8208;in strain between the bilayers. This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nano&#8208;springs that can be applied to various technologies.

         <title>Polymerized Small Molecular Acceptor with Branched Side Chains for All Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 16.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of small molecule acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based organic solar cells have already exceeded 18%. However, the development of polymer acceptors still lags far behind their SMA counterparts mainly due to the lack of efficient polymer acceptors. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X (with X being the branched alkyl chain) by employing the same central core with the SMA L8&#8208;BO but with different branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains on the beta position of the thiophene unit has previously shown improved structural order and charge transport compared to those of Y6. It was found that the molecular packing of SMA&#8208;HD featuring 2&#8208;hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY&#8208;HD is similar to L8&#8208;BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high&#8208;order molecular assembly in SMA&#8208;HD molecules. When combined with PM6, PY&#8208;HD&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) exhibits a high PCE of 16.41%, representing the highest PCE value for the binary all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, the side&#8208;chain modification on the pyrrole site position further improves the performance of the all&#8208;PSCs, and the PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device delivers a new record high efficiency of 16.76% (certified as 16.3%), with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.949&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 23.73&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and a decent fill factor of 74.4%. Our work provides new insights for understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship of polymer acceptors and paves a feasible avenue to develop efficient conjugated polymer acceptors.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal&#8208;Infused Porous Surfaces for Manipulation of Underwater Gas Bubble Transport and Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomimetic artificial surfaces that enable the manipulation of gas bubble mobility have been explored in a wide range of applications in nanomaterial synthesis, surface defouling, biomedical diagnostics, and therapeutics. Although many superhydrophobic surfaces and isotropic lubricant&#8208;infused porous surfaces have been developed to manipulate gas bubbles, the simultaneous control over the adhesion and transport of gas bubbles underwater remains a challenge. Thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs), a class of structured fluids, provide an opportunity to tune the behavior of gas bubbles through LC mesophase transitions using a variety of external stimuli. Using this central idea, we report the design and synthesis of liquid crystal&#8208;infused porous surfaces (LCIPS) and elucidate the effects of the LC mesophase on the transport and adhesion of gas bubbles on LCIPS immersed in water. We demonstrate that LCIPS are a promising class of surfaces with an unprecedented level of responsiveness and functionality, which enable the design of cyanobacteria&#8208;inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen levels in biomimetic cell cultures.

Thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs), a class of structured fluids, provide an opportunity to tune the behavior of gas bubbles through LC mesophase transitions using a variety of external stimuli. Using this central idea, we report the design and synthesis of liquid crystal-infused porous surfaces (LCIPS) and elucidate the effects of the LC mesophase on the transport and adhesion of gas bubbles on LCIPS immersed in water. We demonstrate that LCIPS are a promising class of surfaces with an unprecedented level of responsiveness and functionality, which enable the design of cyanobacteria-inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen levels in biomimetic cell cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Solution&#8208;Deposited and Patternable Conductive Polymer Thin Film Electrodes for Microbial Bioelectronics</title>

Abstract
Microbial bioelectronic devices integrate naturally occurring or synthetically engineered electroactive microbes with microelectronics. These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, we report a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics. Our coating is based on a blend of PEDOT:PSS crosslinked with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying ITO electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current&#8208;producing bacterium&#160;Shewanella oneidensis&#160;MR&#8208;1, this material produces&#160;a 178&#8208;fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin&#8208;film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. We characterize the chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings and demonstrate the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based microbial sensors. We envision that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Synergetic Anion Vacancies and Dense Heterointerfaces into Bimetal Chalcogenide Nanosheet Arrays for Boosting Electrocatalysis Sulfur Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenide. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenide in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn&#8208;S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur&#8208;vacancy and build&#8208;in interfacial field in CoZn&#8208;S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well&#8208;designed 3D nanosheet array structures short ion&#8208;transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn&#8208;S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the build&#8208;in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improve their intrinsic activity.

Abstract
A reliable method for preparing a conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer with a thickness of 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level, was tested as a possible Cu diffusion barrier layer for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh density semiconductor device miniaturization. A polystyrene brush of uniform thickness was grafted onto 4&#8208;inch SiO2/Si wafer substrates with &#8220;self&#8208;limiting&#8221; chemistry favoring such a uniform layer. UV crosslinking and subsequent carbonization transformed this polymer film into an ultrathin a&#8208;C layer without pinholes or hillocks. The uniform coating of nonplanar regions or surfaces is also possible. The Cu diffusion &#8220;blocking ability&#8221; was evaluated by time&#8208;dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests using a metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure. A 0.82&#160;nm&#8208;thick a&#8208;C barrier gave TDDB lifetimes 3.3&#215; longer than that obtained using the conventional 1.0&#160;nm&#8208;thick TaNx diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a&#8208;C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom&#8208;scale thickness, and when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.

         <title>Biomineralized Materials as Model Systems for Structural Composites: 3D Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomineralized materials are sophisticated material systems with hierarchical 3D organizations of minerals and organics, which have been broadly used as model systems for fundamental mechanical, materials science, and biomimetic studies. Our current knowledge of the structure of biological materials is mainly based on 2D imaging techniques, which often impedes comprehensive and accurate understanding of the materials&#8217; intricate 3D architecture and consequently their mechanics, functions, and bioinspired designs. The development of 3D techniques like tomography, additive manufacturing, and 4D testing has opened pathways to study biological materials fully in 3D. In this review, we discuss how applying 3D techniques can provide new insights into biomineralized materials that are either well&#8208;known or possess complex microstructures that are extremely challenging to understand in the 2D framework. Specifically, the diverse structures of biomineralized materials are understood based on four universal structural motifs. Nacre is selected as an example to demonstrate how the progression of knowledge from 2D to 3D can bring substantial improvements to the growth mechanism, biomechanics theories, and bioinspired designs. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiscale 3D tomographic techniques are discussed with a focus on their integration with 3D geometric quantification, 4D in&#8208;situ experiments, and multiscale modeling. Outlook is given on the emerging approaches to investigate the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;function&#8208;biomimetics relationship.

         <title>Advances in High&#8208;Performance Autonomous Energy and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing Textiles with Novel 3D Fabric Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The seamless integration of emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology with traditional wearable textile materials has given the birth to the next&#8208;generation smart textiles, i.e., textile TENGs, which will play a vital role in the era of Internet of Things and artificial intelligences. However, low output power and inferior sensing ability have largely limited the development of textile TENGs. Among various approaches to improve the output and sensing performance, such as material modification, structural design, and environmental management, 3D fabric structural scheme is a facile, efficient, controllable and scalable strategy to increase the effective contact area for contact electrification of textile TENGs without cumbersome material processing and service area restrictions. In this review, the recent advances of the current reported textile TENGs with 3D fabric structures are comprehensively summarized and systematically analyzed in order to clarify their superiorities over 1D fiber and 2D fabric structures in terms of power output and pressure sensing. The forward&#8208;looking integration abilities of the 3D fabrics are also discussed at the end. We hope that the overview and analysis of textile TENGs with distinctive 3D fabric structures will contribute to the development and realization of high&#8208;power output micro/nano wearable power sources and high&#8208;quality self&#8208;powered wearable sensors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seamless integration of emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology with traditional wearable textile materials has given the birth to the next-generation smart textiles, i.e., textile TENGs, which will play a vital role in the era of Internet of Things and artificial intelligences. However, low output power and inferior sensing ability have largely limited the development of textile TENGs. Among various approaches to improve the output and sensing performance, such as material modification, structural design, and environmental management, 3D fabric structural scheme is a facile, efficient, controllable and scalable strategy to increase the effective contact area for contact electrification of textile TENGs without cumbersome material processing and service area restrictions. In this review, the recent advances of the current reported textile TENGs with 3D fabric structures are comprehensively summarized and systematically analyzed in order to clarify their superiorities over 1D fiber and 2D fabric structures in terms of power output and pressure sensing. The forward-looking integration abilities of the 3D fabrics are also discussed at the end. We hope that the overview and analysis of textile TENGs with distinctive 3D fabric structures will contribute to the development and realization of high-power output micro/nano wearable power sources and high-quality self-powered wearable sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Achieving Remarkable Charge Density Via Self&#8208;polarization of Polar High&#8208;k Material in Charge&#8208;excitation Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>

Abstract
Boosting output charge density is top priority for achieving high performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The charge excitation strategy has been demonstrated to be a superior approach to acquire high output charge density. Meanwhile, the molecular charge behaviors in dielectric under strong electric field from high charge density brings new physics that is worth exploring. Here, we report a rapid self&#8208;polarization effect of polar dielectric material by the super&#8208;high electric field in charge excitation TENG, by which the permittivity of polar dielectric material realizes self&#8208;increase to a saturation, and thus enhances the output charge density. Consequently, an ultra&#8208;high charge density of 3.53 mC m&#8722;2 is obtained with 7&#160;&#956;m homemade Lead Zirconate Titanate&#8208;Polyvinylidene fluoride composite film in the atmosphere with 5% relative humidity, which is the highest charge density for TENG with high durability currently. This work provides new guidance for dielectric material optimization under charge excitation to boost the output performance of TENG toward practical applications.

         <title>Highly Active and Durable Single&#8208;Atom Tungsten&#8208;Doped NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanosheet@NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanorod Heterostructures for Water Splitting</title>

Abstract
Developing robust and high active non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) is crucial for the industrialization of hydrogen energy. In this study, we prepared a highly active and durable single&#8208;atom W doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet@NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) electrocatalyst. W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the HER and OER with ultralow overpotentials (39 and 106&#160;mV for the HER and 171 and 239&#160;mV for the OER at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively) and excellent long&#8208;term durability (500 h), outperforming commercial precious&#8208;metal catalysts and many other previously reported transition metal&#8208;based compounds. The introduction of single&#8208;atom W delocalized the spin state of Ni, which resulted in an increase in the Ni d&#8208;electron density. This caused the optimization of the adsorption/desorption process of H and a significant reduction in the adsorption free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (O* &#8594; OOH*), thus accelerating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HER and OER. This work provides a rational feasible strategy to design single&#8208;atom catalysts for water splitting and to develop advanced transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts by regulating delocalized spin states.

         <title>Realizing 19.05% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells by Progressively Improving Charge Extraction and Suppressing Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Improving the charge extraction and suppressing the charge recombination are critical important to minimize the loss of absorbed photons and improve the device performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, highly efficient PSCs are demonstrated by progressively improving the charge extraction and suppressing the charge recombination through the combination of side chain engineering of new nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), adopting ternary blend and introducing volatilizable solid additive. The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) side chains on BTP&#8208;Th induce certain steric hindrance for molecular packing and phase separation, which is mitigated by fluorination of side chains on BTP&#8208;FTh. Moreover, by introducing two highly crystalline molecules, IDIC and DTT, as the second acceptor and volatilizable solid additive, respectively, into the PTQ10:BTP&#8208;FTh host blend, the molecular crystallinity is significantly improved and the blend morphology is finely optimized. As expected, the enhanced charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination are progressively realized, contributing to the largely improved fill factor (FF) of the resultant devices. Accompanied by the enhanced open circuit voltage (Voc) and short current density (Jsc), a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% is realized by adding IDIC acceptor and DTT additive to the PTQ10:BTP&#8208;FTh host blend.

         <title>Direct Observation of Strong Anomalous Hall Effect and Proximity&#8208;induced Ferromagnetic State in SrIrO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The 5d iridium&#8208;based transition metal oxides have gained broad interest because of their strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling which favors new or exotic quantum electronic states. On the other hand, they rarely exhibit more mainstream orders like ferromagnetism due to generally weak electron&#8208;electron correlation strength. Here, we show a proximity&#8208;induced ferromagnetic (FM) state with TC &#8776; 100 K and strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy in a SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure via interfacial charge transfer by using a ferromagnetic insulator in contact with SIO. Electrical transport allows to selectively probe the FM state of the SIO layer and the direct observation of a strong, intrinsic and positive anomalous Hall effect (AHE). For T &#8804; 20 K, the AHE displays unusually large coercive and saturation field, a fingerprint of a strong pseudospin&#8208;lattice coupling. A Hall angle, &#963;xyAHE/&#963;xx, larger by an order of magnitude than in typical 3d metals and a FM net moment of about 0.1 &#956;B/Ir, is reported. This emphasizes how efficiently the nontrivial topological band properties of SIO can be manipulated by structural modifications and the exchange interaction with 3d TMOs.

Abstract
The looming impact of climate change and the diminishing supply of fossil fuels both highlight the need for a transition to more sustainable energy sources. Whilst solar and wind can produce much of the energy needed, to meet all our energy demands there is a need for a diverse sustainable energy generation mix. Thermoelectrics can play a vital role in this, by harvesting otherwise wasted heat energy and converting it into useful electrical energy. Whilst efficient thermoelectric materials have been known since the 1950's, thermoelectrics has not been utilised beyond a few niche applications. This can in part be attributed to the high cost of manufacturing and the geometrical restraints of current commercial manufacturing techniques. Printing offers a potential route to manufacture thermoelectric materials at a lower price point and allow for the fabrication of generators that are custom build to meet the waste heat source requirements. This review details the significant progress that has been made in recent years in printing of thermoelectric materials in all thermoelectric material groups and printing methods, and highlights very recent publications that show printing can now offer comparable performance to commercially manufactured thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Organometal Halide Perovskite Nanowalls Grown By Glancing Angle Deposition</title>

Abstract
Polarizers are ubiquitous components in current optoelectronic devices as displays or photographic cameras. Yet the control over light polarization is an unsolved challenge as the main drawback of the existing display technologies relays in significant optical losses. In such a context, organometal halide perovskites (OMHP) can play a decisive role given their flexible synthesis with under design optical properties such as tunable bandgap and photoluminescence, and excellent light emission with a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate. Therefore, along with their outstanding electrical properties have elevated hybrid perovskites as the material of choice in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Among the different OMHP nanostructures, nanowires and nanorods have lately arisen as key players in the control of light polarization for lighting or detector applications. Herein, we present the fabrication of highly aligned and anisotropic methylammonium lead iodide perovskite nanowalls by Glancing Angle Deposition, compatible with most substrates. Their high alignment degree provides the samples with anisotropic optical properties such as light absorption and photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization&#8208;sensitive response. Our facile vacuum&#8208;based approach embodies a milestone in the development of last&#8208;generation polarization&#8208;sensitive perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as lighting appliances or self&#8208;powered photodetectors.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Ultrathin Highly&#8208;Crystalline Pt&#8208;Ni Nanostructure on Metal Carbide Template for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Structure engineering strategies such as core&#8208;shell and hollow nanostructures are effective pathways to improve the utilization of noble metals for catalysis. However, nowadays materials design based on these strategies are still largely rely on precious metals templates. Herein, we report the epitaxial growth of highly&#8208;crystalline Pt3Ni overlayer on earth abundant nickel carbide, forming Ni3C@Pt3Ni core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with well&#8208;define interface through a new lattice&#8208;match&#8208;directed synthetic strategy. Derived from such core&#8208;shell nanostructure, ultrathin highly&#8208;crystalline Pt3Ni nanocage has an advantageous configuration of ORR favored facets and inherent high active surface area for ORR, bringing high mass activity and specific activity as much as 4.71 A/mgPt and 5.14&#160;mA/cm2, which are 26 and 20 times to that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. This novel epitaxial growth of platinum opens up new avenues to rationally design highly active and economical electrocatalysts.

         <title>Diverging Expressions of Anharmonicity in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lead&#8208;based halide perovskite (PbHaP) crystals were&#160;shown to have strongly anharmonic structural dynamics. This behavior is important because it may be the origin of their exceptional photo&#8208;voltaic properties. The double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6, has been recently studied as a lead&#8208;free alternative for optoelectronics applications. However, it does not exhibit the excellent photo&#8208;voltaic activity of the PbHaPs. Therefore, to explore the correlation between the anharmonic structural dynamics and optoelectronic properties in PbHaPs, we&#160;investigate the structural dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6 and compare it to its lead&#8208;based analog CsPbBr3. Using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman measurements, we&#160;find that both materials are indeed strongly anharmonic. Nonetheless, the expression of their anharmonic behavior is markedly different. Cs2AgBiBr6 has well&#8208;defined normal modes throughout the measured temperature range, while CsPbBr3 exhibits a complete breakdown of the normal mode picture above 200&#160;K. We&#160;suggest that the breakdown of the normal mode picture implies that the average crystal structure may not be a proper starting point to understand the electronic properties of the crystal. In addition to our main findings, we&#160;also discovered an unreported phase of Cs2AgBiBr6 below&#160;&#8764;37&#160;K.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Photosensitizable Bacterial Cellulose as Engineered Living Material for Skin Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Living materials based on bacterial cellulose (BC) represent a natural and promising candidate for wound dressing. Both physical adsorption and chemical methods have been applied to BC for realizing antibacterial function. However, effective and long&#8208;lasting incorporation of bactericidal moieties to BC remains challenging. We herein explore a Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans&#8208;based direct synthetic method to fabricate photosensitizer&#8208;grafted BC through&#160;in situ&#160;bacterial metabolism in the presence of TPEPy&#8208;modified glucose (TPEPy&#8208;Glc). Our results verify that the direct biosynthesis method is efficient and convenient to endow BC with outstanding fluorescence and light&#8208;triggered photodynamic bactericidal activity for skin wound repair. This work presents a new approach to fabricate eco&#8208;friendly and active wound dressing with light&#8208;controlled bactericidal activity by microbial metabolism. The successful modification of the glucose carbon source of microorganisms also offers insights for biosyntheses of other living materials through microbial metabolism.

         <title>Enabling Fast Na+ Transfer Kinetics in the Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Region of Hard Carbon Anodes for Ultrahigh Rate Sodium Storage</title>

Abstract
Efficient electrode materials, that combine high power and high energy, are the crucial requisites of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) which have unwrapped new possibilities in the areas of grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Hard carbons (HCs) are considered as the leading candidate anode materials for SIBs, however, the primary challenge of slow charge transfer kinetics at the low potential region (&lt; 0.1&#160;V) remains unresolved till date, and the underlying structure&#8208;performance correlation is under debate. Herein, we report ultrafast sodium storage in the whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;region (0.01&#8208;2&#160;V) with the Na+ diffusion coefficient enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude (&#8764;10&#8211;7 cm2 s&#8211;1) through rational deploying the physical parameters of HC using a ZnO assisted bulk etching strategy. We unveil that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p&#8208;band center, respectively, and balanced of Ea and Eb is critical in enhancing the charge storage kinetics. The charge storage mechanism in HCs is evidenced through comprehensive in(ex)&#8208;situ techniques. The as prepared HC microspheres deliver a record high rate performance of 107 mAh g&#8211;1 @ 50 A g&#8211;1 and unprecedented electrochemical performance at extremely low temperature (426 mAh g&#8211;1 @ &#8208;40&#176;C).

         <title>Mucosa&#8208;Like Conformal Hydrogel Coating for Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mucosa is a protective and lubricating barrier in biological tissue, which has a great clinical inspiration because of its slippery, soft, and hydrophilic surface. However, mimicking mucosal traits on complex surface remains an enormous challenge. Herein, a novel approach to create mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating is developed. A thin conformal hydrogel layer mimicking the epithelial layer is obtained by first absorbing micelles, followed by forming covalent interlinks with the polymer substrate via interface&#8208;initiated hydrogel polymerization. The resulting coating exhibits uniform thickness (&#8764; 15&#160;&#956;m), mucosa&#8208;matched compliance (Young's modulus = 1.1&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;kPa) and lubrication (coefficients of friction = 0.018&#160;&#177; 0.003), robust interfacial bonding against peeling (peeling strength = 1218.0&#160;&#177; 187.9 J m&#8211;2), as well as high water absorption capacity. It effectively resists adhesion of proteins and bacteria without compromising biocompatibility. As demonstrated by a in vivo cynomolgus monkey model and clinical trial, applications of the mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating on the endotracheal tube significantly reduces intubation&#8208;related complications, such as invasive stimuli, mucosal lesions, laryngeal oedema, inflammation, and postoperative pain. This work offers a promising prototype for surface decoration of biomedical devices and holds great prospects for clinical translation to enable interventional operations with minimally invasive impacts

         <title>Scalable Growth of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films via Orientation Filter Funnel for High&#8208;Performance Transistors with Excellent Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. However, crystallization of organic films is normally governed by stochastic nucleation and incoherent growth, posing a formidable challenge to grow large&#8208;sized OSCFs. Here, we present an &#8220;orientation filter funnel&#8221; concept for the scalable growth of OSCFs with well&#8208;aligned, single&#8208;orientated crystals. By rationally designing solvent wetting/dewetting patterns on the substrate, this approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic orientation and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of large&#8208;area OSCFs. As a result, this unique concept for crystal growth not only enhances average mobility of organic film by 4.5&#8208;fold, but also improves its uniformity of electrical properties with a low mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%, the new lowest record among the organic devices. Our method offers a general and scalable route to produce OSCFs towards real&#8208;word electronic applications.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Integration of Silicon Nanomembranes with 2D Materials for Bioresorbable, Wireless Neurochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although neurotransmitters are key substances closely related to evaluate degenerative brain diseases as well as regulate essential functions in the body, many research efforts have been focused on monitoring relatively associated physical, mechanical and electrophysiological parameters, rather than direct observation of such biochemical messengers. Here, we introduce a bioresorbable silicon&#8208;based neurochemical analyzer incorporated with two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides as a completely implantable brain&#8208;integrated system that can wirelessly monitor time&#8208;dynamic behaviors of dopamine and relevant parameters in a simultaneous mode. Extensive range of examinations of molybdenum/tungsten disulfide (MoS2/WS2) nanosheets and catalytic iron nanoparticles (Fe NPs) highlights underlying mechanisms of strong chemical and target&#8208;specific responses to the neurotransmitters along with theoretical modeling tools. Systematic characterizations demonstrate reversible, stable and long&#8208;term operational performances of the degradable bioelectronics with excellent sensitivity and selectivity over those of non&#8208;dissolvable counterparts. A complete set of in vivo experiments with comparative analysis using carbon fiber electrodes illustrates capabilities for a potential use as a clinically accessible tool to associated neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Mechanically Guided Hierarchical Assembly of 3D Mesostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D), hierarchical micro/nanostructures formed with advanced functional materials are of growing interest due to their broad potential utilities in electronics, robotics, battery technology, and biomedical engineering. Among various strategies in 3D micro/nanofabrication, a set of methods based on compressive buckling offers wide&#8208;ranging material compatibility, fabrication scalability, and precise process control. Previously reported works of this type rely on a single, planar prestretched elastomeric platform to transform thin&#8208;film precursors with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layouts into 3D architectures. The simple planar configuration of bonding sites between these precursors and their assembly substrates prevents realization of certain types of complex 3D geometries. In this paper we report a set of hierarchical assembly concepts that leverage multiple layers of prestretched elastomeric substrates to induce not only compressive buckling of 2D precursors bonded to them but also of themselves, thereby creating 3D mesostructures mounted at multiple levels of 3D frameworks with complex, elaborate configurations. Control over strains used in these processes provides reversible access to multiple different 3D layouts in a given structure. Examples to demonstrate these ideas through both experimental and computational results span vertically aligned helices to closed 3D cages, selected for their relevance to 3D conformal bio&#8208;interfaces and multifunctional microsystems.

Abstract
We demonstrate the design, fabrication, and characterization of wafer&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;bias power detectors based on two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs). The MoS2 FETs are fabricated using a wafer&#8208;scale process on 8&#160;&#956;m thick Polyimide film, which in principle serves as flexible substrate. The performances of two CVD&#8208;MoS2 sheets, grown with different processes and showing different thicknesses, are analyzed and compared from the single device fabrication and characterization steps to the circuit level. The power detector prototypes exploit the nonlinearity of the transistors above the cut&#8208;off frequency of the devices. The proposed detectors are designed employing a transistor model based on measurement results. The fabricated circuits operate in Ku&#8208;band between 12 and 18&#160;GHz, with a demonstrated voltage responsivity of 45&#160;V/W at 18&#160;GHz in the case of monolayer MoS2 and 104&#160;V/W at 16&#160;GHz in the case of multilayer MoS2, both achieved without applied DC bias. They are the best performing power detectors fabricated on flexible substrate reported to date. The measured dynamic range exceeds 30&#160;dB outperforming other semiconductor technologies like silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits and GaAs Schottky diodes.
