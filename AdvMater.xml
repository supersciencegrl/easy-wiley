         <title>An Injectable Hydrogel with Ultrahigh Burst Pressure and Innate Antibacterial Activity for Emergency Hemostasis and Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable hydrogel with excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, inherent antibacterial activity, and on&#8208;demand removability is developed using &#949;&#8208;polylysine and tetra&#8208;armed poly(ethylene glycol) succinimidyl succinate. The optimized hydrogel gelatinizes rapidly, sustains ultrahigh burst pressure, and effectively stops lethal hemorrhage in anticoagulated large animals. Furthermore, it facilitates sutureless repair of liver defects, skin incisions, and infected full&#8208;thickness skin wounds in rat models.








Abstract
Uncontrolled bleeding and wound infections following severe trauma pose significant challenges for existing tissue adhesives, primarily due to their weak wet adhesion, slow adhesion formation, cytotoxicity concerns, and lack of antibacterial properties. Herein, an injectable hydrogel (denoted as ES gel) with rapid, robust adhesive sealing and inherent antibacterial activity based on &#949;&#8208;polylysine and a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative is developed. The engineered hydrogel exhibits rapid gelation behavior, high mechanical strength, strong adhesion to various tissues, and can sustain an ultrahigh burst pressure of 450&#160;mmHg. It also presents excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibacterial properties, and on&#8208;demand removability. Significantly improved hemostatic efficacy of ES gel compared to fibrin glue is demonstrated using various injury models in rats and rabbits. Remarkably, the adhesive hydrogel can effectively halt lethal non&#8208;compressible hemorrhages in visceral organs (liver, spleen, and heart) and femoral artery injury models in fully anticoagulated pigs. Furthermore, the hydrogel outperforms commercial products in sutureless wound closure and repair in the rat liver defect, skin incision, and infected full&#8208;thickness skin wound models. Overall, this study highlights the promising clinical applications of ES gel for managing uncontrolled hemorrhage, sutureless wound closure, and infected wound repair.

         <title>Designer Anions for Better Rechargeable Lithium Batteries and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamental considerations on the structural design and modifications of robust salt anions for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries are comprehensively discussed, and recent achievements in this domain are briefly outlined. Particular attention are paid to the different cell chemistries imposed by electroactive materials and electrolyte systems, and their impact on the selection of suitable salt anions.








Abstract
Non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, generally consisting of metal salts and solvating media, are indispensable elements for building rechargeable batteries. As the major sources of ionic charges, the intrinsic characters of salt anions are of particular importance in determining the fundamental properties of bulk electrolyte, as well as the features of the resulting electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases/interfaces. To cope with the increasing demand for better rechargeable batteries requested by emerging application domains, the structural design and modifications of salt anions are highly desired. Here, salt anions for lithium and other monovalent (e.g., sodium and potassium) and multivalent (e.g., magnesium, calcium, zinc, and aluminum) rechargeable batteries are outlined. Fundamental considerations on the design of salt anions are provided, particularly involving specific requirements imposed by different cell chemistries. Historical evolution and possible synthetic methodologies for metal salts with representative salt anions are reviewed. Recent advances in tailoring the anionic structures for rechargeable batteries are scrutinized, and due attention is paid to the paradigm shift from liquid to solid electrolytes, from intercalation to conversion/alloying&#8208;type electrodes, from lithium to other kinds of rechargeable batteries. The remaining challenges and key research directions in the development of robust salt anions are also discussed.

         <title>Eliminating Hole Extraction Barrier in 1D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient and Stable Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI3 Solar Cells with a Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiocholine iodine (TchI) with a suitable functional group and dipole moment is used to construct TchPbI3/CsPbI3 1D/3D heterojunction, which eliminates the hole extraction barrier and passivates interface defect, thereby improving carriers extraction in the device. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 19.08%, and a certified efficiency of 18.7%, which is a record efficiency for inorganic perovskite C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have the advantages of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;stability, but their photovoltaic performance is limited by severe defect&#8208;induced recombination and low hole extraction efficiency. 1D perovskite is proven to effectively passivate the defects on the perovskite surface, therefore reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. However, the unsuitable energy level of most 1D perovskite renders an undesired downward band bending for 3D perovskite, resulting in a high hole extraction barrier and reduced hole extraction efficiency. Therefore, rational design and selection of 1D perovskites as the modifiers are essential in balancing defect passivation and hole extraction. In this work, based on simulation calculations, thiocholine iodide (TchI) is selected to prepare 1D perovskite with high work function and then constructs TchPbI3/CsPbI3 1D/3D perovskite heterojunction. Experimental results show that this strategy eliminates the hole extraction barrier at the perovskite/carbon interface, which improves the hole extraction efficiency of corresponding devices. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between the thiol group and Pb suppresses defect&#8208;induced recombination effectively and improves the stability of CsPbI3. The assembled C&#8208;PSCs exhibit a champion efficiency of 19.08% and a certified efficiency of 18.7%. To the best of the knowledge, this is a new efficiency record for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Ultrahigh Electrobending Deformation in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectric Ceramics via Defect Concentration Gradient Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh electrobending deformation is obtained in lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics by defect dipoles&#8217; gradient design. The contributions of electrostrain and electrobending to the measured apparent strain are distinguished for the first time. In cantilever structure, monolayer piezoelectric ceramic can generate large displacement of &#177;1.5 mm, highlighting its promising potential for practical application like vibration control.








Abstract
Recent breakthroughs in defect&#8208;engineered lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics have reported remarkable electrostrain values, surpassing the limit of lattice distortion. This has aroused wide concern on bending deformation and the associated underlying mechanism. Herein, via designing lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics with varying volatilization characteristics, it is uncovered that the ultrahigh electrobending deformation is primarily attributed to a large strain gradient induced by unevenly distributed defect dipoles. In 0.5 mm thick Sr/Sn co&#8208;doped potassium sodium niobate ceramics featuring volatile K/Na elements, the inherent bipolar electrostrain value can reach 0.3% at 20&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 due to the existence of defect dipoles, while the gradient distribution of defect dipole generates significant bending displacement, amplifying apparent electrostrain value to 1.1%. Notably, nonvolatile Ba0.99TiO2.99 ceramic with homogeneous defect dipole distribution does not present electrobending. Of particular interest is that the electrobending phenomenon can be observed through introducing a defect dipole gradient into barium titanate ceramic. A monolayer ceramic with defect dipole gradient can generate large tip displacement (&#177;1.5&#160;mm) in cantilever structure, demonstrating its promising potential in precise positioning. This study delves into the underlying mechanism driving electrobending deformation and its impact on the apparent electrostrain measurement in defect&#8208;engineered piezoelectric ceramics, providing fresh perspectives for the development of piezoelectric bending actuators.

         <title>Octahedral Nanocrystals of Ru&#8208;Doped PtFeNiCuW/CNTs High&#8208;Entropy Alloy: High Performance Toward pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;PtFeNiCuW&#160;HEA octahedra nanocrystals enclosed by {111} facets are deliberately prepared. The robust pH&#8208;universal HER performance of such octahedra nanocrystals is ascribed to the high activity and stability of the surface {111} facets, the specific high entropy alloy composition, the active W site for water splitting, and superior Cu and Pt sites for hydrogen desorption.








Abstract
Integrating high&#8208;entropy philosophy and nanocrystal&#8208;specific orientation into a single catalyst represents a promising strategy in development of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Nonetheless, shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals is challenging owing to the distinct redox potentials and growth dynamics of metal elements. Herein, a one&#8208;pot co&#8208;reduction method is developed to fabricate ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;doped PtFeNiCuW octahedral HEA nanocrystals onto carbon nanotubes (Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs). It is demonstrated that Ru dopants and W(CO)6 promote the concurrent reduction and growth of other metal precursors to obtain higher yield and larger size of HEA nanocrystals, despite low Ru content in Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs. As an electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs exhibits low overpotentials of 9, 16, and 34&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slopes of 19.2, 27.9, and 23.1&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. As a cathodic catalyst, Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs operates for up to 1500 and 1200 h in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively, at a current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a two&#8208;electrode system for full water splitting. Theoretical calculations reveal accelerated kinetics of H2O dissociation on W sites and *H desorption on hollow Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu and Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;Pt sites.

     alt="Octahedral Nanocrystals of Ru-Doped PtFeNiCuW/CNTs High-Entropy Alloy: High Performance Toward pH-Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ru-PtFeNiCuW&#160;HEA octahedra nanocrystals enclosed by {111} facets are deliberately prepared. The robust pH-universal HER performance of such octahedra nanocrystals is ascribed to the high activity and stability of the surface {111} facets, the specific high entropy alloy composition, the active W site for water splitting, and superior Cu and Pt sites for hydrogen desorption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating high-entropy philosophy and nanocrystal-specific orientation into a single catalyst represents a promising strategy in development of high-performance catalysts. Nonetheless, shape-controlled synthesis of high-entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals is challenging owing to the distinct redox potentials and growth dynamics of metal elements. Herein, a one-pot co-reduction method is developed to fabricate ruthenium (Ru)-doped PtFeNiCuW octahedral HEA nanocrystals onto carbon nanotubes (Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs). It is demonstrated that Ru dopants and W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; promote the concurrent reduction and growth of other metal precursors to obtain higher yield and larger size of HEA nanocrystals, despite low Ru content in Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs. As an electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs exhibits low overpotentials of 9, 16, and 34&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Tafel slopes of 19.2, 27.9, and 23.1&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. As a cathodic catalyst, Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs operates for up to 1500 and 1200 h in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively, at a current density of 50&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a two-electrode system for full water splitting. Theoretical calculations reveal accelerated kinetics of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation on W sites and *H desorption on hollow Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu and Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;Pt sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Van der Waals Encapsulation by Ultrathin Oxide for Air&#8208;Sensitive 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The native oxide of liquid gallium is used as van der Waals encapsulation layer for the protection of air&#8208;sensitive two&#8208;dimensional materials in ambient environment. The facile selective etching endows it with the ability of direct device fabrication without removal of encapsulation. Robust encapsulation ability is demonstrated with black phosphorus and molybdenum ditelluride, while dual&#8208;gate device can be fabricated without decapsulation.








Abstract
The ambient stability is one of the focal points for applications of 2D materials, especially for those well&#8208;known air&#8208;sensitive ones, such as black phosphorus (BP) and transitional metal telluride. Traditional methods of encapsulation, such as atomic layer deposition of oxides and heterogeneous integration of hexagonal boron nitride, can hardly avoid removal of encapsulation layer when the 2D materials are encapsulated for further device fabrication, which causes complexity and damage during the procedure. Here, a van der Waals encapsulation method that allows direct device fabrication without removal of encapsulation layer is introduced using Ga2O3 from liquid gallium. Taking advantage of the robust isolation ability against ambient environment of the dense native oxide of gallium, hundreds of times longer retention time of (opto)electronic properties of encapsulated BP and MoTe2 devices is realized than unencapsulated devices. Due to the ultrathin high&#8208;&#954; properties of Ga2O3, top&#8208;gated devices are directly fabricated with the encapsulation layer, simultaneously as a dielectric layer. This direct device fabrication is realized by selective etching of Ga2O3, leaving the encapsulated materials intact. Encapsulated 1T' MoTe2 exhibits high conductivity even after 150 days in ambient environment. This method is, therefore, highlighted as a promising and distinctive one compared with traditional passivation approaches.

         <title>Printing Green: Microalgae&#8208;Based Materials for 3D Printing with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microalgae&#8208;based materials for two&#8208;photon laser 3D printing are introduced for the first time. After functionalizing the microalgae&#8208;derived triglycerides with acrylate moieties it is possible to print intricate 3D microstructures with sub&#8208;micron resolution. Printing is enabled solely by the green pigments inherently contained in the microalgae. The 3D printed microstructures are biocompatible.








Abstract
Microalgae have emerged as sustainable feedstocks due to their ability to fix CO2 during cultivation, rapid growth rates, and capability to produce a wide variety of metabolites. Several microalgae accumulate lipids in high concentrations, especially triglycerides, along with lipid&#8208;soluble, photoactive pigments such as chlorophylls and derivatives. Microalgae&#8208;derived triglycerides contain longer fatty acid chains with more double bonds on average than vegetable oils, allowing a higher degree of post&#8208;functionalization. Consequently, they are especially suitable as precursors for materials that can be used in 3D printing with light. This work presents the use of microalgae as &#8220;biofactories&#8221; to generate materials that can be further 3D printed in high resolution. Two taxonomically different strains&#160;&#8212;Odontella aurita (O. aurita, BEA0921B) and Tetraselmis striata (T. striata, BEA1102B)&#8212;&#160;are identified as suitable microalgae for this purpose. The extracts obtained from the microalgae (mainly triglycerides with chlorophyll derivatives) are functionalized with photopolymerizable groups and used directly as printable materials (inks) without the need for additional photoinitiators. The fabrication of complex 3D microstructures with sub&#8208;micron resolution is demonstrated. Notably, the 3D printed materials show biocompatibility. These findings open new possibilities for the next generation of sustainable, biobased, and biocompatible materials with great potential in life science applications.

         <title>Evolution of Naturally Dried MXene&#8208;Based Composite Aerogels with Flash Joule Annealing for Large&#8208;Scale Production of Highly Sensitive Customized Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the naturally dried MXene&#8208;based aerogels and their applications in highly sensitive piezoresistive sensors, where a systematic drying strategy is explored in detail, including the improvement of MXene sheet stiffness, control of hydrophobicity, and optimization of pore structure. Further combined with laser engraving, customized multifunctional sensors are developed.








Abstract
MXene aerogels, known for good electrical properties, offer immense potential for the development of high&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensors. However, the intrinsic challenges stemming from the poor self&#8208;assembly capability and high hydrophilicity of MXene impede the natural drying process of MXene&#8208;based hydrogels, thereby constraining their application on a large scale in sensor technology. Herein, a graphene&#8208;assisted approach aimed at modulating the hydrophobicity and enhancing framework strength of MXene through a well&#8208;designed prefreezing technique incorporating 3D spherical macroporous structures is proposed. This synergistic strategy enables the fabrication of naturally dried MXene aerogels across various size scales. Moreover, the integration of 3D spherical macroporous structures improves elasticity and electrical responsiveness of aerogels. Consequently, the aerogel sensor exhibits great performances, including high sensitivity (1250 kPa&#8722;1), low detection limit (0.4&#160;Pa), wide frequency response range (0.1&#8211;8&#160;Hz), and excellent stability (1000 cycles). This sensor proves adept at monitoring pressure signals ranging from lightweight paper to human motion. Additionally, the application of customized laser engraving endows aerogels with unique functionalities, such as compressibility and immunity to strain, stretchability and resistance to compression, as well as wind detection. Thus, the proposed approach holds significant promise as a scalable method for the mass production of aerogels with versatile applications.

         <title>Spin Gapless Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum materials, with nontrivial quantum phenomena and mechanisms, promise efficient quantum technologies with enhanced functionalities. Quantum technology is held back because a gap between fundamental science and its implementation is not fully understood yet. In order to capitalize the quantum advantage, a new perspective is required to figure&#160;out and close this gap. In this review, spin gapless quantum materials, featured by fully spin&#8208;polarized bands and the electron/hole transport, are discussed from the perspective of fundamental understanding and device applications. Spin gapless quantum materials can be simulated by a minimal two&#8208;band models and could help to understand band structure engineering in various topological quantum materials discovered so far. It is explicitly highlighted that various types of spin gapless band dispersion are fundamental ingredients to understand quantum anomalous Hall effect. Based on conventional transport in the bulk and topological transport on the boundaries, various spintronic device aspects of spin gapless quantum materials as well as their advantages in different models for topological field effect transistors are&#160;reviewed.

         <title>Tunable Phonon Polariton Hybridization in a Van der Waals Hetero&#8208;Bicrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterostructures provide unique opportunities for controlling light at the nanoscale. Here, hetero&#8208;bicrystals composed of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are studied. These bicrystals feature phonon polaritons, the hybrid quasiparticles resulting from the coupling of photons and lattice vibrations, which show a dispersion tailorable via avoided polariton mode crossings.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons, the hybrid quasiparticles resulting from the coupling of photons and lattice vibrations, have gained significant attention in the field of layered van der Waals heterostructures. Particular interest has been paid to hetero&#8208;bicrystals composed of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which feature polariton dispersion tailorable via avoided polariton mode crossings. In this work, the polariton eigenmodes in MoO3&#8208;hBN hetero&#8208;bicrystals self&#8208;assembled on ultrasmooth gold are systematically studied using synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy. It is experimentally demonstrated that the spectral gap in bicrystal dispersion and corresponding regimes of negative refraction can be tuned by material layer thickness, and these results are quantitatively matched with a simple analytic model. Polaritonic cavity modes and polariton propagation along &#8220;forbidden&#8221; directions are also investigated in microscale bicrystals, which arise from the finite in&#8208;plane dimension of the synthesized MoO3 micro&#8208;ribbons. The findings shed light on the unique dispersion properties of polaritons in van der Waals heterostructures and pave the way for applications leveraging deeply sub&#8208;wavelength mid&#8208;infrared light&#8208;matter interactions.

         <title>Multicompartment Polyion Complex Micelles Based on Triblock Polypept(o)ides Mediate Efficient siRNA Delivery to Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts for Antistromal Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>

Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer and the third leading cause for cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. The tumor is difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat due to its inherent resistance to chemotherapy. Antistromal therapy is a novel therapeutic approach, targeting cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the tumor microenvironment. CAF&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5) is identified as a novel target for antistromal therapy of HCC with high translational relevance. Biocompatible polypept(o)ide&#8208;based polyion complex micelles (PICMs) constructed with a triblock copolymer composed of a cationic poly(l&#8208;lysine) complexing anti&#8208;MFAP&#8208;5 siRNA (siMFAP&#8208;5) via electrostatic interaction, a poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate) block loading cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine (DES) via &#960;&#8722;&#960;&#160;interaction as endosomal escape enhancer and polysarcosine originated from amino acid sarcosine (N&#8208;methylglycine) for protein&#8208;repulsive effect, are generated for siRNA delivery. Intravenous injection of siMFAP&#8208;5/DES PICMs significantly reduced the hepatic tumor burden in a syngeneic implantation model of HCC, with a superior MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown effect over siMFAP&#8208;5 PICMs or lipid nanoparticles. Transcriptome and histological analysis revealed that MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown inhibited CAF&#8208;related tumor vascularization, suggesting the anti&#8208;angiogenic effect of RNA interference therapy. In conclusion, the developed multicompartment PICMs combining siMFAP&#8208;5 and DES in a single polypept(o)ide micelle induce a specific knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and demonstrate a potent antitumor efficacy (80% reduced tumor burden versus untreated control) in a clinically relevant HCC model.

         <title>Electroactive Ionic Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity for High&#8208;Performance Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the higher&#8208;order structure of ionic polymers is a promising method to achieve high energy densities, long&#8208;term cycling stability, and straightforward processing in energy storage devices. A solution&#8208;processable viologen&#8208;based polymer of intrinsic microporosity (200 m2 g&#8722;1) hosts a 315 F g&#8722;1 gravimetric and 193 mF cm&#8722;2 areal capacitance that is maintained at &gt;90% over 10,000 charging&#8211;discharging cycles in a prototype device.








Abstract
Here, an ionic polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) as a high&#8208;functioning supercapacitor electrode without the need for conductive additives or binders is reported. The performance of this material is directly related to its large accessible surface area. By comparing electrochemical performance between a porous viologen PIM and a nonporous viologen polymer, it is revealed that the high energy and power density are both due to the ability of ions to rapidly access the ionic PIM. In 0.1&#160;m H2SO4 electrolyte, a pseudocapacitve energy of 315 F g&#8722;1 is observed, whereas in 0.1&#160;m Na2SO4, a capacitive energy density of 250 F g&#8722;1 is obtained. In both cases, this capacity is retained over 10&#160;000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles, without the need for stabilizing binders or conductive additives even at moderate loadings (5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). This desirable performance is maintained in a prototype symmetric two&#8208;electrode capacitor device, which has &gt;99% Coloumbic efficiency and a &lt;10 mF capacity drop over 2000 cycles. These results demonstrate that ionic PIMs function well as standalone supercapacitor electrodes and suggest ionic PIMs may perform well in other electrochemical devices such as sensors, ion&#8208;separation membranes, or displays.

Abstract
The use of optoelectronic devices for high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power data transmission and computing is considered in the next&#8208;generation logic circuits. Heterostructures, which can generate and transmit photoresponse signals dealing with different input lights, are highly desirable for optoelectronic logic gates. Here, the printed on&#8208;chip perovskite heterostructures are demonstrated to achieve optical&#8208;controlled &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221; optoelectronic logic gates. Perovskite heterostructures are printed with a high degree of control over composition, site, and crystallization. Different regions of the printed perovskite heterostructures exhibit distinguishable photoresponse to varied wavelengths of input lights, which can be utilized to achieve optical&#8208;controlled logic functions. Correspondingly, parallel operations of the two logic gates (&#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;) by way of choosing the output electrodes under the single perovskite heterostructure. Benefiting from the uniform crystallization and strict alignment of the printed perovskite heterostructures, the integrated 3 &#215; 3 pixels all exhibit 100% logic operation accuracy. Finally, optical&#8208;controlled logic gates responding to multiwavelength light can be printed on the predesigned microelectrodes as the on&#8208;chip integrated circuits. This printing strategy allows for integrating heterostructure&#8208;based optical and electronic devices from a unit&#8208;scale device to a system&#8208;scale device.

         <title>Imparting Ultra&#8208;High Strength to Polymers via a New Concept Strategy of Construction of up to Duodecuple Hydrogen Bonding among Macromolecular Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interconnecting macromolecules via multiple hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) can simultaneously strengthen and toughen polymers, but material synthesis becomes extremely difficult with increasing number of H&#8208;bonding donors and acceptors; therefore, most reports are limited to triple and quadruple H&#8208;bonds. Herein, we overcome this bottleneck, adopting a quartet&#8208;wise approach of constructing H&#8208;bonds instead of the traditional pairwise method. Thus, large multiple hydrogen bonds can be easily established, and the supramolecular interactions are further reinforced.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interconnecting macromolecules via multiple hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) can simultaneously strengthen and toughen polymers, but material synthesis becomes extremely difficult with increasing number of H-bonding donors and acceptors; therefore, most reports are limited to triple and quadruple H-bonds. Herein, we overcome this bottleneck, adopting a quartet-wise approach of constructing H-bonds instead of the traditional pairwise method. Thus, large multiple hydrogen bonds can be easily established, and the supramolecular interactions are further reinforced. Especially, when such multiple H-bond motifs are embedded in polymers, four macromolecular chains&#8212;rather than two as usual&#8212;are tied, distributing the applied stress over a larger volume and more significantly improving the overall mechanical properties. Proof-of-concept studies indicate that the proposed intermolecular multiple H-bonds (up to duodecuple) are readily introduced in polyurethane. A record-high tensile strength (105.2&#160;MPa) is achieved alongside outstanding toughness (352.1 MJ&#8901;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), fracture energy (480.7 kJ&#8901;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and fatigue threshold (2978.4 J&#8901;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Meantime, the polyurethane has acquired excellent self-healability and recyclability. This strategy is also applicable to nonpolar polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane, whose strength (15.3&#160;MPa) and toughness (50.3 MJ&#8901;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are among the highest reported to date for silicones.

         <title>A Highly Stretchable, Conductive, and Transparent Bioadhesive Hydrogel as a Flexible Sensor for Enhanced Real&#8208;Time Human Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Real&#8208;time continuous monitoring of non&#8208;cognitive markers is crucial for the early detection and management of chronic conditions. However, current diagnostic methods are often invasive and primarily available in clinical settings, limiting their use for at&#8208;home monitoring. To bridge this gap, soft and flexible hydrogels have emerged while facing challenges such as low electrical conductivity, poor mechanical properties and adhesion, limited durability, and low biocompatibility. To address these challenges, we have developed an elastic and biodegradable hydrogel&#8208;based wearable sensor with unparalleled accuracy, mechanical properties, and durability for intelligent gait sensing, capable of adhering to skin while monitoring real&#8208;time human health. Employing an innovative supramolecular engineering strategy, we synthesized a pseudo&#8208;slide&#8208;ring hydrogel, named &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;(pAAm/pAETAc), which combines polyacrylamide (pAAm),&#160;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), and poly 2&#8208;(acryloyloxy)ethyltrimethylammonium chloride (AETAc) bio ionic liquid (Bio&#8208;IL). This novel approach decouples conflicting mechano&#8208;chemical effects arising from different molecular building blocks and provides a balance of mechanical toughness (1.1&#215;106&#160;Jm&#8722;3), flexibility, conductivity (&#8764;0.29 S m&#8722;1), and tissue adhesion (&#8764;27&#160;kPa), along with rapid self&#8208;healing and remarkable stretchability (&#8764;3000%). Unlike traditional hydrogels, our one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy avoids chemical crosslinkers and metallic nanofillers, reducing cytotoxicity and immunogenicity risks. While the pAAm building blocks provide mechanical strength and toughness, the formation of the pseudo&#8208;slide&#8208;ring structure endows it with high stretchability and flexibility suitable for real&#8208;world applications. Additionally, the rational combination of pAAm backbone with naturally derived polymers, such as &#946;&#8208;CD and pAETAc, ensures biocompatibility and biodegradability, as reflected in our cellular and&#160;in vivo&#160;biocompatibility studies. Furthermore, the hydrogel offers transparency, passive&#8208;cooling, UV&#8208;shielding, and 3D printability, enhancing its practicality for everyday use. Most importantly, the hydrogel&#8208;based sensor demonstrated improved&#160;efficiency, stability, and sensitivity in motion/haptic sensing. This multifunctional sensor represents a significant advancement in minimally invasive real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring, particularly in human movement and motor dysfunction applications.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Mediated Neurogenic Signaling: The Impact of Surface Geometry and Chemistry on Neural Cell Behavior for Regenerative and Brain&#8208;Machine Interfacing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanomaterial advancements have driven progress in central and peripheral nervous system applications such as tissue regeneration and brain&#8208;machine interfacing. Ideally, neural interfaces with native tissue should seamlessly integrate, a process which is often mediated by the interfacial material properties. Surface topography and material chemistry are significant extracellular stimuli that can influence neural cell behavior to facilitate tissue integration and augment therapeutic outcomes. This review characterizes topographical modifications, including micropillars, microchannels, surface roughness, and porosity, implemented on regenerative scaffolding and brain&#8208;machine interfaces. Their impact on neural cell response is summarized through neurogenic outcome and mechanistic analysis. We also review the effects of surface chemistry on neural cell signaling with common interfacing compounds like carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, conductive polymers, and biologically inspired matrices. Finally, the impact of these extracellular mediated neural cues on intracellular signaling cascades is discussed to provide perspective on the manipulation of neuron and neuroglia cell microenvironments to drive therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Photonics for Neuromorphic Computing: Fundamentals, Devices, and Opportunities</title>

Abstract
In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. Conventional electronic computing has experienced certain difficulties, particularly concerning the latency, crosstalk, and energy consumption of digital processors. As the Moore's law approaches its terminus, there is a urgent need for alternative computing architectures that can satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the von Neumann model. Recently, the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub&#8208;nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. Such non&#8208;von Neumann photonic computing systems hold the promise to cater to the escalating requirements of AI and scientific computing. In this review, we&#160;study recent advancements in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, and from the perspective of materials and device engineering, we&#160;lay out the scientific and technological breakthroughs necessary to advance the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. In particular, we&#160;examine various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PICs. We&#160;evaluate the performances of different designs by energy efficiency in operations per joule (OP/J) and compute density in operations per squared millimeter per second (OP/mm2/s). Putting special emphasis on photonic components such as VCSEL lasers, optical interconnects, and frequency microcombs, we&#160;highlight the most recent breakthroughs in photonic engineering and materials science used to create advanced neuromorphic computing chips. Lastly, we&#160;recognize that existing technologies encounter obstacles in achieving photonic AI accelerators with peta&#8208;level computing speed and energy efficiency, and we&#160;also explore potential approaches in new devices, fabrication, materials, and integration to drive innovation. As the current challenges and barriers in cost, scalability, footprint, and computing capacity are resolved one&#8208;by&#8208;one, photonic neuromorphic systems are bound to co&#8208;exist with, if not replace, conventional electronic computers and transform the landscape of AI and scientific computing in the foreseeable future.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Integrated Low&#8208;Dimensional Flexible Electronics Beyond the Limitations of van der Waals Contacts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes that hydrogen&#8208;bonding significantly enhances the tunneling effect to achieve contact resistance approaching the quantum limit that enables overcoming the van der Waals gap. Experiments further demonstrate that hydrogen&#8208;bonding integrated flexible transistors have low contact resistance and high mobility with values an order of magnitude higher than their van der Waals counterparts.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) integration enables clean contacts for low&#8208;dimensional electronic devices. The limitation remains; however, that an additional tunneling contact resistance occurs owing to the inherent vdW gap between the metal and the semiconductor. Here, it is demonstrated from theoretical calculations that stronger non&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions facilitate electron tunneling and significantly reduce the contact resistance; thus, promising to break the limitations of the vdW contact. &#960;&#8208;plane hydrogen&#8208;bonding contacts in surface&#8208;engineered MXene/carbon nanotube metal/semiconductor heterojunctions are realized, and an anomalous temperature&#8208;dependent tunneling resistance is observed. Low&#8208;dimensional flexible thin&#8208;film transistors integrated by hydrogen&#8208;bonding contacts exhibit both excellent flexibility and carrier mobility orders of magnitude higher than their counterparts with vdW contacts. This strategy demonstrates a scalable solution for realizing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power flexible electronics beyond vdW contacts.

Electronic devices based on paper and banknotes are successfully developed using a solution process with PVK and SnO2 NPs. These devices display photosynaptic behavior under UV pulse illumination and achieved a 91.7% recognition rate using the Yale Face Database. For security applications, the 20 &#215; 20 array configuration exhibits excellent performance, maintaining the same code under long&#8208;term storage and bending conditions.








Abstract
Paper is a readily available material in nature. Its recyclability, eco&#8208;friendliness, portability, flexibility, and affordability make it a favored substrate for researchers seeking cost&#8208;effective solutions. Electronic devices based on solution process are fabricated on paper and banknotes using PVK and SnO2 nanoparticles. The devices manufactured on paper substrates exhibit photosynaptic behavior under ultraviolet pulse illumination, stemming from numerous interactions on the surface of the SnO2 nanoparticles. A light&#8208;modulated artificial synapse device is realized on a paper at a low voltage bias of &#8722;0.01&#160;V, with an average recognition rate of 91.7% based on the Yale Face Database. As a security device on a banknote, 400 devices in a 20 &#215; 20 array configuration exhibited random electrical characteristics owing to the local morphology of the SnO2 nanoparticles and differences in the depletion layer width at the SnO2/PVK interface. The security Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) key based on the current distribution extracted at &#8722;1&#160;V show unpredictable reproducibility with 50% uniformity, 48.7% inter&#8208;Hamming distance, and 50.1% bit&#8208;aliasing rates. Moreover, the device maintained its properties for more than 210 days under a curvature radius of 8.75&#160;mm and bias and UV irradiation stress conditions.

         <title>A Universal Coulombic Efficiency Compensation Strategy for Zinc&#8208;Based Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal CE compensation strategy is proposed for alkaline Zn/Fe flow batteries (AZIFBs) by triggering the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodic side. The strategy effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; in catholyte by consuming the extra OH&#8722; during continuous cycling process. As a result, AZIFBs demonstrate exceptional cycling performance with extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0005%/cycle).








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are well suited for energy storage because of their good safety, high cell voltage, and low cost. However, the occurrence of irreversible anodic parasitic reactions results in a diminished coulombic efficiency (CE), unbalanced charge state of catholyte/anolyte and subsequently, a poor cycling performance. Here, a universal CE compensation strategy centered around the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodic side, is reported. This strategy aims to equalize the charge state of the [Fe(CN)6]3&#8208;/4&#8722;&#8208;based catholyte and counteract pH fluctuations. The OER process can be implemented either directly on the electrode through electrochemical reaction or in an external catalytic reactor column via a redox&#8208;mediated process. This innovative approach effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; in discharged catholyte and [Zn(OH)4]2&#8722; in charged anolyte by consuming the extra OH&#8722; during a continuous cycling process. As a result, AZIFBs demonstrate exceptional cycling performance with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0128%/day (or 0.0005%/cycle) over 600 cycles at 80% state of charge (SOC). The proposed CE compensation strategy not only provides an effective way to address the CE loss issue for AZIFBs, but also can be applied to diverse battery technologies encountering CE loss caused by water/oxygen&#8208;induced parasitic reactions.

         <title>Controlled Nucleation and Oriented Crystallization of Methylammonium&#8208;Free Perovskites via In&#8208;Situ Generated 2D Perovskite Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Enhancing stability while maintaining high efficiency is among the primary challenges in the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a crystal growth technique assisted by in&#8208;situ generated 2D perovskite phases has been developed to construct high quality 2D/3D perovskite films. The in&#8208;situ generated 2D perovskite serve as templates for regulating the nucleation and oriented crystal growth in the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;rich film. This led to a high film quality with much reduced trap density and an ultralong carrier lifetime. The obtained perovskite film shows excellent stability under extreme environment conditions (T = 200 &#176;C, RH = 75 &#177; 5%). The corresponding PSC achieved an efficiency of 26.16% (certified 25.84%), along with excellent operational stability (T93 &gt; 1300 hours, T = &#8764;50&#160;&#176;C) as well as outstanding high and low temperature cycle stability.

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence through Energy Transfer within a Chiral Polymer Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8211;guest strategy that allows for energy transfer between a chiral polymer host and a representative chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter is demonstrated. Such energy transfer results in large amplification of the circular polarization of the emitter (from gPL&#160;=&#160;0.00092 to 0.091), including amplified circularly polarized electroluminescence in an organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that are able to emit high levels of circularly polarized (CP) light hold significant promise in numerous future technologies. Such devices require chiral emissive materials to enable CP electroluminescence. However, the vast majority of current OLED emitter classes, including the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triplet&#8208;harvesting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, produce very low levels of CP electroluminescence. Here a host&#8211;guest strategy that allows for energy transfer between a chiral polymer host and a representative chiral TADF emitter is showcased. Such a mechanism results in a large amplification of the circular polarization of the emitter. As such, this study presents a promising avenue to further boost the performance of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices, enabling their further development and eventual commercialization.

         <title>Lifecycle Management for Sustainable Plastics: Recent Progress from Synthesis, Processing to Upcycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports the recent progress on the entire lifecycle of plastics from synthesis, processing, to upcycling for reducing plastic pollution and fostering sustainability. Specifically, innovations in plastics synthesis techniques, optimization of polymer processing methodologies, and breakthroughs in recycling technologies are crucial to advancing sustainable plastics use and lessening its environmental footprint.








Abstract
Plastics, renowned for their outstanding properties and extensive applications, assume an indispensable and irreplaceable role in modern society. However, the ubiquitous consumption of plastic items has led to a growing accumulation of plastic waste. Unreasonable practices in the production, utilization, and recycling of plastics have led to substantial energy resource depletion and environmental pollution. Herein, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in the lifecycle management of plastics are timely reviewed. Unlike typical reviews focused on plastic recycling, this work presents an in&#8208;depth analysis of the entire lifecycle of plastics, covering the whole process from synthesis, processing, to ultimate disposal. The primary emphasis lies on selecting judicious strategies and methodologies at each lifecycle stage to mitigate the adverse environmental impact of waste plastics. Specifically, the article delineates the rationale, methods, and advancements realized in various lifecycle stages through both physical and chemical recycling pathways. The focal point is the attainment of optimal recycling rates for waste plastics, thereby alleviating the ecological burden of plastic pollution. By scrutinizing the entire lifecycle of plastics, the article aims to furnish comprehensive solutions for reducing plastic pollution and fostering sustainability across all facets of plastic production, utilization, and disposal.

         <title>Expanding RNAi to Kidneys, Lungs, and Spleen via Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) siRNA Lipid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inhibition of disease&#8208;causing mutations using RNA interference (RNAi) has resulted in clinically approved medicines with additional candidates in late stage trials. However, targetable tissues currently in pre&#8208;clinical development are limited to liver following systemic intravenous (IV) administration because predictable delivery of siRNA to non&#8208;liver tissues remains an unsolved challenge. Here we provide evidence of durable extrahepatic gene silencing enabled by siRNA Selective Organ Targeting lipid nanoparticles (siRNA SORT LNPs) to the kidneys, lungs, and spleen. LNPs excel at dose&#8208;dependent silencing of tissue&#8208;enriched endogenous targets resulting in 60&#8211;80% maximal knockdown after a single IV injection and up to 88% downregulation of protein expression in mouse lungs after two doses. To examine knockdown potency and unbiased organ targeting, we utilize B6.129TdTom/EGFP mice that constitutively express the TdTomato transgene across all cell types to demonstrate 58%, 45%, and 15% drop in TdTomato fluorescence in lungs, spleen, and kidneys respectively. Finally, we establish physiological relevance of siRNA SORT LNP&#8208;mediated gene silencing via acute suppression of endogenous Tie2 which induced lung&#8208;specific phenotypic alteration of vascular endothelial barrier. Due to plethora of extrahepatic diseases that might benefit from RNAi interventions, we anticipate that our findings will expand pre&#8208;clinical landscape of therapeutically relevant targets beyond the liver.

         <title>Volumetric 3D Printing of Endoskeletal Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overprinting, enabled by Computed Axial Lithography (CAL), opens the door for volumetrically 3D printing endoskeletal soft robots in seconds. Using a thermoreversible hydrogel, Cameron Darkes&#8208;Burkey reports the first functional overprint capable of osmotic actuation while demonstrating a ray&#8208;based dose calculation method for predicting the print time of overprinted geometries.








Abstract
Computed Axial Lithography (CAL) is an emerging technology for manufacturing complex parts, all at once, by circumventing the traditional layered approach using tomography. Overprinting, a unique additive manufacturing capability of CAL, allows for a 3D geometry to be formed around a prepositioned insert where the occlusion of light is compensated for by the other angular projections. This method opens the door for novel applications within additive manufacturing for multi&#8208;material systems such as endoskeletal robots. Herein, this work presents one such application with a simple Gelatin Methacrylate (GelMA)hydrogel osmotic actuator with an embedded endoskeletal system. GelMA is an ideal material for this application as it is swellable and has reversible thermal gelation, enabling suspension of the endoskeleton during printing. By tuning the material formulation, the actuator design, and post&#8208;processing, swelling&#8208;induced bending actuation of 60 degrees is achieved. To aid in the printing process, a simple computational method for determining the absolute dose absorbed by the resin allowing for print time prediction is also proposed.

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have shown great potential in the application of optoelectronic devices due to their unique molecular properties. Recently, emerging phosphonic acid&#8208;based SAMs, 2&#8208;(9Hcarbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz), have successfully applied in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs). More importantly, impressive results based on 2PACz SAMs have been reported recently in succession. Therefore, it is essential to provide an insightful summary to promote it further development. In this review, the molecule design strategies about 2PACz are first concluded. Subsequently, we systematically review the recent advances of 2PACz and its derivatives for single junction PSCs, tandem PSCs, OSCs and PeLEDs. Finally, we conclude and discuss future challenges for 2PACz and its derivatives to further develop in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Formation and Detriments of Residual Alkaline Compounds on High&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;nickel layered oxides LiNixM1&#8208;xO2 (x &#8805; 0.9) have emerged as promising cathode materials for automotive batteries due to their high energy density and lower cost. However, the formation and accumulation of surface alkaline compounds during storage hinder their mass production and commercialization. Here, a validated chemical method is employed to deconvolute and quantify the evolution of each residual lithium compound in four representative cathodes during ambient&#8208;air storage, viz., LiNiO2 (LNO), LiNi0.95Co0.05O2 (NC), LiNi0.95Mn0.05O2 (NM), and LiNi0.95Al0.05O2 (NA). Furthermore, the activation energy of reaction between water and the cathode is determined by measuring the leached LiOH concentration at various temperatures. While residual lithium and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry measurements collectively reveal that the air stability overall follows the trend of NM &gt; NA &#8776; NC &gt; LNO, the aged NM exhibits the highest charge&#8208;transfer resistance and the worst electrochemical performance among the cathodes. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy unveil that the aged NM is plagued by a large area of resistive spinel&#8208;like M3&#8211;xLixO4 phases, leading to aggravated particle reaction heterogeneity. Finally, a one&#8208;step recalcination method is demonstrated effective in fully restoring the degraded cathodes. This work provides insights into overcoming air sensitivity issues of high&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>Arbitrary Construction of Versatile NIR&#8208;Driven Microrobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging light&#8208;driven micro/nanorobots (LMNRs) showcase profound potential for sophisticated manipulation and various applications. However, the realization of a versatile and straightforward fabrication technique remains a challenging pursuit. This study introduces an innovative bulk heterojunction organic semiconductor solar cell (OSC)&#8208;based spin&#8208;coating approach, aiming to facilitate the arbitrary construction of LMNRs. Leveraging the distinctive properties of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive organic semiconductor heterojunction solution, this technique enables uniform coating across various dimensional structures (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D) to be LMNRs, denoted as &#8220;motorization&#8221;. The film, with a slender profile measuring approximately 140&#160;nm in thickness, effectively preserves the original morphology of objects while imparting actuation capabilities exceeding hundreds of times their own weight. The propelled motion of these microrobots is realized through NIR&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;diffusiophoresis, showcasing a versatile array of controllable motion profiles. The strategic customization of arbitrary microrobot construction addresses specific applications, ranging from 0D microrobots inducing living crystal formation to intricate, multidimensional structures designed for tasks such as microplastic extraction, cargo delivery, and phototactic precise maneuvers. This study advances user&#8208;friendly and versatile LMNR technologies, unlocking new possibilities for various applications, signaling a transformative era in multifunctional micro/nanorobot technologies.

         <title>Hofmeister Effects in Supramolecular Chemistry for Anion&#8208;Modulation to Stabilize Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage, which, however, is facing the challenge of instable Zn anodes. The anion is pivotal in the stability of anodes, which have not been paid enough attention to. Herein, we report the modulation of anions using the Hofmeister series in supramolecular chemistry to boost the stability of Zn anodes. We found that the right&#8208;side anions in the Hofmeister series (e.g., OTf&#8722;) could enhance the Zn2+ transference number, increase the Coulombic efficiency, facilitate uniform Zn deposition, reduce the freezing point of electrolytes, and thereby stabilize the Zn anodes. More importantly, the right&#8208;side anions could form strong interaction with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin compared to the left&#8208;side anions, and hence the addition of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin could further enhance the stability of Zn anodes in OTf&#8722;&#8208;based electrolytes, showing enhancement of cycling lifespan in the Zn//Zn symmetric cells more than 45.5 times with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin compared with those without &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. On the contrary, the left&#8208;side anions showed worse rate performance after the addition of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. These results provided an effective and novel approach to choose anions and matching additives to stabilize the anodes and achieve high&#8208;performance AZIBs through Hofmeister effect.

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Evolution of Li2O&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface on CoOx Embedded Carbon Fibers as Li Anode Host</title>

Abstract
Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which could show fast Li+ diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and non&#8208;uniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, we successfully prepared CoOx embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoOx) as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18O isotope labeling, we aimed to elucidate the role of CoOx during SEI evolution that CoOx contributes significantly to Li2O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li2O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li+ migration kinetics, and therefore the CNF&#8208;CoOx@Li anode could exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

         <title>An Active Halide Catholyte Boosts the Extra Capacity for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical active halide electrolyte, Li3VCl6, exhibiting both a decent ionic conductivity and a high reversible Li+&#8208;storage capacity, is proposed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The incorporation of this active electrolyte leads to a significant increase in the energy density of the composite cathode compared to traditional inactive electrolyte, advancing its multifunctionality and practicability.








Abstract
Replacing flammable organic liquid electrolytes with nonflammable solid electrolytes (SEs) in lithium batteries is crucial for enhancing safety across various applications, including portable electronics, electric vehicles, and scalable energy storage. Since typical cathode materials do not possess superionic conductivity, Li&#8208;ion conduction in the cathode predominantly relies on incorporating a significant number of SEs as additives to form a composite cathode, which substantially compromises the energy density of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, a halide SE, Li3VCl6 is demonstrated, which not only exhibits a decent Li+ conductivity, but more importantly, delivers a highly reversible capacity of approximately 80 mAh g&#8722;1 with an average voltage of 3&#160;V versus Li+/Li. The ionic conductivity of Li3VCl6 experiences marginal fluctuations upon electrochemical lithiation/delithiation, as its prototypical solid&#8208;solution reaction results solely in a reduction of lithium vacancy. When combined with the traditional LiFePO4 cathode, the active Li3VCl6 catholyte enables an impressive capacity of 217.1 mAh g&#8722;1LFP and about 50% increase in energy density compared with inactive catholytes. Harnessing the integrated mass of the catholyte&#8212;which can serve as an active material&#8212;presents an opportunity to boost the extra capacity, rendering it feasible in applications.

         <title>The Enormous Potential of Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries as The Mainstream Energy Storage Technology for Large&#8208;Scale Commercial Applications</title>

Abstract
Cost&#8208;effectiveness plays a decisive role in sustainable operating of rechargeable batteries. As such, the low cost&#8208;consumption of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) provides a promising direction for &#8220;how do SIBs/PIBs replace Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) counterparts&#8221; based on their resource abundance and advanced electrochemical performance. To rationalize the SIBs/PIBs technologies as alternatives to LIBs from the unit energy cost perspective, this review gives the specific criteria for their energy density at possible electrode&#8208;price grades and various battery&#8208;longevity levels. The cost ($ kWh&#8722;1 cycle&#8722;1) advantage of SIBs/PIBs has been ascertained by the cheap raw&#8208;material compensation for the cycle performance deficiency and the energy density gap with LIBs. Furthermore, the cost comparison between SIBs and PIBs, especially on cost per kWh and per cycle, is also involved. This review explicitly manifests the practicability and cost&#8208;effectiveness towards SIBs are superior to PIBs whose commercialization has so far been hindered by low energy density. Even so, the huge potential on sustainability of PIBs, to outperform SIBs, as the mainstream energy storage technology is revealed as long as PIBs achieve long cycle life or enhanced energy density, the related outlook of which has been proceeded as the next development directions for commercial applications.

         <title>Digital Light 3D Printing of Double Thermoplastics with Customizable Mechanical Properties and Versatile Reprocessability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Digital light processing (DLP) is a 3D printing technology offering high resolution and speed. Printable materials are commonly based on multifunctional monomers, resulting in the formation of thermosets that usually cannot be reprocessed or recycled. Some efforts have been made in DLP 3D printing of thermoplastic materials. However, these materials exhibit limited and poor mechanical properties. Here, we present a new strategy for DLP 3D printing of thermoplastics based on a sequential construction of two linear polymers with contrasting (stiff and flexible) mechanical properties. The inks consist of two vinyl monomers, which lead to the stiff linear polymer, and &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid, which forms the flexible linear polymer via thermal ring&#8208;opening polymerization in a second step. By varying the ratio of stiff and flexible linear polymers, the mechanical properties can be tuned with Young's modulus ranging from 1.1&#160;GPa to 0.7&#160;MPa, while the strain at break increased from 4% to 574%. Furthermore, these printed thermoplastics allow for a variety of reprocessability pathways including self&#8208;healing, solvent casting, reprinting, and closed&#8208;loop recycling of the flexible polymer, contributing to the development of a sustainable materials economy. Last, we demonstrate the potential of the new material in applications ranging from soft robotics to electronics.

         <title>An Ultralight Composite Current Collector Enabling High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are promising alternatives to current Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their advantages such as high energy density, low cost, and convenient production. However, the copper (Cu) current collector accounts for more than 25 wt% of the total weight of the anode&#8208;free battery without capacity contribution, which severely reduces the energy and power densities. Here, we show a new family of ultralight composite current collectors with a low areal density of 0.78&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, representing significant weight reduction of 49%&#8208;91% compared with the Cu&#8208;based current collectors for high&#8208;energy Li batteries. Rational molecular engineering of the polyacylsemicarbazide substrate enables enhanced interfacial interaction with the sputtered Cu layer, which results in excellent interfacial stability, flexibility, and safety for the obtained anode&#8208;free batteries. The battery&#8208;level energy density has been significantly improved by 36%&#8208;61%, and a maximum rate capability reaches 5 C (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) attributed to the homogeneous Li+ flux and smooth Li deposition on the nanostructured Cu layer. Our results not only open a new avenue to improve the energy and power densities of anode&#8208;free batteries via composite current collector innovation but, in a broader context, provide a new paradigm to pursue high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;safety, and flexible batteries.

         <title>Living Synthelectronics: A New Era for Bioelectronics Powered by Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of hybrid electronics combining genetically edited living organisms with nonliving bioelectronics, which is defined as living synthelectronics, is emerging recently. They use engineered cells/viruses as the building blocks, sensing components, or power source and show many unique properties such as intrinsic self&#8208;healing and dynamic programming ability. The living synthelectronics is expected to provide new possibilities for future bioelectronics.








Abstract
Bioelectronics, which converges biology and electronics, has attracted great attention due to their vital applications in human&#8211;machine interfaces. While traditional bioelectronic devices utilize nonliving organic and/or inorganic materials to achieve flexibility and stretchability, a biological mismatch is often encountered because human tissues are characterized not only by softness and stretchability but also by biodynamic and adaptive properties. Recently, a notable paradigm shift has emerged in bioelectronics, where living cells, and even viruses, modified via gene editing within synthetic biology, are used as core components in a new hybrid electronics paradigm. These devices are defined as &#8220;living synthelectronics,&#8221; and they offer enhanced potential for interfacing with human tissues at informational and substance exchange levels. In this Perspective, the recent advances in living synthelectronics are summarized. First, opportunities brought to electronics by synthetic biology are briefly introduced. Then, strategic approaches to designing and making electronic devices using living cells/viruses as the building blocks, sensing components, or power sources are reviewed. Finally, the challenges faced by living synthelectronics are raised. It is believed that this paradigm shift will significantly contribute to the real integration of bioelectronics with human tissues.

         <title>Revitalizing Oxygen Reduction Reactivity of Composite Oxide Electrodes via Electrochemically Deposited PrOx Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presents a concise, straightforward approach and mechanistic insight that enables high activity in all&#8208;ceramic electrodes, providing both industrial and academic value. An old&#8208;fashioned composite oxide cathode (i.e., LSM&#8211;YSZ) in which a Pr&#8208;based nanocatalyst is introduced using an &#8216;electrochemical deposition approach&#8217; shows reinvigorated electrochemical performance, shedding new light on its potential as an air electrode.








Abstract
Solid oxide fuel cells that operate at intermediate temperatures require efficient catalysts to enhance the inherently poor electrochemical activity of the composite electrodes. Here, a simple and practical electrochemical deposition method is presented for fabricating a PrOx overlayer on lanthanum strontium manganite&#8211;yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia (LSM&#8211;YSZ) composite electrodes. The method requires less than four minutes for completion and can be carried out under at ambient temperature and pressure. Crucially, the treatment significantly improves the electrode's performance without requiring heat treatment or other supplementary processes. The PrOx&#8208;coated LSM&#8211;YSZ electrode exhibits an 89% decrease in polarization resistance at 650&#160;&#176;C (compared to an untreated electrode), maintaining a tenfold reduction after &#8776;400&#160;h. Transmission line model analysis using impedance spectra confirms how PrOx coating improved the oxygen reduction reaction activity. Further, tests with anode&#8208;supported single cells reveal an outstanding peak power density compared to those of other LSM&#8211;YSZ&#8208;based cathodes (e.g., 418&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that multicomponent coating, such as (Pr,Ce)Ox, can also be obtained with this method. Overall, the observations offer a promising route for the development of high&#8208;performance solid oxide fuel cells.

         <title>Giant X&#8208;Ray Circular Dichroism in a Time&#8208;Reversal Invariant Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article reveals a new type of altermagnet, in which the symmetry allows for typical ferromagnetic behaviors. It presents X&#8208;ray circular dichroism observed in a chiral antiferromagnet with time&#8208;reversal symmetry. This phenomenon contrasts conventional X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism. As X&#8208;rays propagate through the material, the Berry curvature, arising from the inversion symmetry breaking, gives rise to distinct circular dichroism.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray circular dichroism, arising from the contrast in X&#8208;ray absorption between opposite photon helicities, serves as a spectroscopic tool to measure the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials and identify the handedness of chiral crystals. Antiferromagnets with crystallographic chirality typically lack X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism because of time&#8208;reversal symmetry, yet exhibit weak X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism. Here, the observation of giant natural circular dichroism in the Ni L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption of Ni3TeO6 is reported, a polar and chiral antiferromagnet with effective time&#8208;reversal symmetry. To unravel this intriguing phenomenon, a phenomenological model is proposed that classifies the movement of photons in a chiral crystal within the same symmetry class as that of a magnetic field. The coupling of X&#8208;ray polarization with the induced magnetization yields giant X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism, revealing typical ferromagnetic behaviors allowed by the symmetry in an antiferromagnet, i.e., the altermagnetism of Ni3TeO6. The findings provide evidence for the interplay between magnetism and crystal chirality in natural optical activity. Additionally, the first example of a new class of magnetic materials exhibiting circular dichroism is established with time&#8208;reversal&#160;symmetry.

         <title>A Nature&#8208;Derived, Hetero&#8208;Structured, Pro&#8208;Healing Bioadhesive Patch for High&#8208;Performance Sealing of Wet Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the SSAD is developed, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is potentially adaptable to broad applications, under different pH values and air or liquid pressures, in sutureless wound sealing and healing.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives are promising alternatives to sutures and staples to achieve wound closure and hemostasis. However, they often do not work well on tissues that are soaked in blood or other biological fluids, and organs that are typically exposed to a variety of harsh environments such as different pH values, nonhomogeneous distortions, continuous expansions and contractions, or high pressures. In this study, a nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the SSAD is developed, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is successfully applied for the sealing and healing of tissue defects within 10 s in diverse extreme injury scenarios in vivo including rat stomach perforation, small intestine perforation, fetal membrane defect, porcine carotid artery incision, and lung lobe laceration. The findings reveal a promising new type of self&#8208;adhesive regenerative SSAD&#8208;Patch, which is potentially adaptable to broad applications (under different pH values and air or liquid pressures) in sutureless wound sealing and healing.

Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CT&#8208;OLEDs) have a large color&#8208;tuning range, high efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance, making them ideal for human&#8208;machine interactive terminals of wearable biomedical devices. However, the device operational lifetime of CT&#8208;OLEDs is currently far from reaching practical requirements. To address this problem, a tetradentate Pt(II) complex named tetra&#8208;Pt&#8208;dbf, which can emit efficiently in both monomer and aggregation states, is designed. This emitter has high Td of 508&#160;&#176;C and large intermolecular bonding energy of &#8208;52.0&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8315;1, which improve its thermal/chemical stability. This unique single&#8208;emitter CT&#8208;OLED essentially avoids the &#8220;color&#8208;aging issue&#8221; and achieves a large color&#8208;tuning span (red to yellowish green) and a high external quantum efficiency &#65288;EQE&#65289; of &#8776;30% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 as well as an EQE of above 25% at 10000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. A superior LT90 operational lifetime of 520,536 h at a functional luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is over 20 times longer than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CT&#8208;OLEDs, is estimated. To demonstrate the potential application of such OLEDs in wearable biomedical devices, a simple electromyography (EMG)&#8208;visualization system is fabricated using the CT&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Focusing Micromechanical Polaritons in Topologically Nontrivial Hyperbolic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study takes a micromechanical approach to unlock topologically resilient vibrating polaritons in analog to van der Waals nanophotonics. It is shown that due to the embedded topological protection, hyperbolic focused radiation remains resilient against random defects.








Abstract
Vertically stacked multiple atomically thin layers have recently widened the landscape of rich optical structures thanks to these quantum metamaterials or van der Waals (vdW) materials, featuring hyperbolic polaritons with unprecedented avenues for light. Despite their far&#8208;reaching implications, most of their properties rest entirely on a trivial band topological origin. Here, a 2D approach is adopted toward a micromechanical vdW analogue that, as a result of engineered chiral and mirror symmetries, provides topologically resilient hyperbolic radiation of mechanical vibrations in the ultrasonic regime. By applying laser vibrometry of the micrometer&#8208;sized metasurface, we are able to exhibit the exotic fingerprints of robust hyperbolic radiation spanning several frequencies, which beyond their physical relevance, may enable ultrasonic&#160;technologies.

         <title>Monochorionic Twinning in Bioengineered Human Embryo Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a thermoformed&#8208;based microwell platform culture conditions are identified to create human monochorionic twin blastoids from na&#239;ve pluripotent stem cells. Twin blastoids form through division of the pluripotent cell mass and implant with higher efficiency than singleton blastoids in a microfluidic endometrium&#8208;on&#8208;chip adhesion assay. This technology opens new avenues for in&#8208;depth exploration of monochorionic twin formation and its developmental implications.








Abstract
Monochorionic twinning of human embryos increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. The rarity of such twinning events, combined with ethical constraints in human embryo research, makes investigating the mechanisms behind twinning practically infeasible. As a result, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the origins and early phenotypic presentation of monochorionic twin embryos. In this study, a microthermoformed&#8208;based microwell screening platform is used to identify conditions that efficiently induce monochorionic twins in human stem cell&#8208;based blastocyst models, termed &#8220;twin blastoids&#8221;. These twin blastoids contain a cystic GATA3+ trophectoderm&#8208;like epithelium encasing two distinct inner cell masses (ICMs). Morphological and morphokinetic analyses reveal that twinning occurs during the cavitation phase via splitting of the OCT4+ pluripotent core. Notably, each ICM in twin blastoids contains its own NR2F2+ polar trophectoderm&#8208;like region, ready for implantation. This is functionally tested in a microfluidic chip&#8208;based implantation assay with epithelial endometrium cells. Under defined flow regimes, twin blastoids show increased adhesion capacity compared to singleton blastoids, suggestive of increased implantation potential. In conclusion, the development of technology enabling large&#8208;scale formation of twin blastoids, coupled with high&#8208;sensitivity readout capabilities, presents an unprecedented opportunity for systematically exploring monochorionic twin formation and its impact on embryonic development.

         <title>Single Atom Catalysts Remodel Tumor Microenvironment for Augmented Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new sono&#8208;immunotherapy strategy using Pd&#948;+ single atom catalysts to enhance positive sonodynamic responses to the immunosuppressive and sono&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The introduction of rich Pd&#948;+ single atoms atomically dispersed in Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty nanosheets can dramatically augment sono&#8208;immunotherapy efficacy against primary and abscopal tumors through reactive oxygen species induced immunogenic cell death.








Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a huge hurdle in immunotherapy. Sono&#8208;immunotherapy is a new treatment modality that can reverse immunosuppressive TME, but the sonodynamic effects are compromised by overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and hypoxia in the TME. Herein, this work reports a new sono&#8208;immunotherapy strategy using Pd&#948;+ single atom catalysts to enhance positive sonodynamic responses to the immunosuppressive and sono&#8208;suppressive TME. To demonstrate this technique, this work employs rich and reductive Ti vacancies in Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty nanosheets to construct the atomically dispersed Pd&#8208;C3 single atom catalysts (SAC) with Pd content up to 2.5 wt% (PdSA/Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty). Compared with Pd nanoparticle loaded Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty, PdSA/Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty single&#8208;atom enzyme showed augmented sonodynamic effects that are ascribed to SAC facilitated electron&#8211;hole separation, rapid depletion of overexpressed GSH by ultrasound (US) excited holes, and catalytic decomposition of endogenous H2O2 for relieving hypoxia. Importantly, the sono&#8208;immunotherapy strategy can boost abscopal antitumor immune responses by driving maturation of dendritic cells and polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages into the antitumoral M1 phenotype. Bilateral tumor models demonstrate the complete eradication of localized tumors and enhance metastatic regression. Th strategy highlights the potential of single&#8208;atom catalysts for robust sono&#8208;immunotherapy by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Realizing Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 25.6% Through Crystallization Kinetics and Spatial Orientation Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating Hydantoin into the precursor, the crystallization kinetics of perovskite is effectively regulated, resulting in the formation of perovskite films with a highly&#8208;oriented out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation. This enhancement is accompanied by a significant reduction in defect density, leading to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a remarkable efficiency of 25.66% (certified 25.15%) and outstanding stability.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerged as highly promising candidates for photovoltaic applications, owing to the exceptional optoelectronic properties and low cost. Nonetheless, the performance and stability of solar cells suffer from the defect states of perovskite films aroused by non&#8208;optically active phases and non&#8208;centralized crystal orientation. Herein, a versatile organic molecule, Hydantoin, to modulate the crystallization of perovskite, is developed.

&lt;p&gt;By incorporating Hydantoin into the precursor, the crystallization kinetics of perovskite is effectively regulated, resulting in the formation of perovskite films with a highly-oriented out-of-plane orientation. This enhancement is accompanied by a significant reduction in defect density, leading to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a remarkable efficiency of 25.66% (certified 25.15%) and outstanding stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerged as highly promising candidates for photovoltaic applications, owing to the exceptional optoelectronic properties and low cost. Nonetheless, the performance and stability of solar cells suffer from the defect states of perovskite films aroused by non-optically active phases and non-centralized crystal orientation. Herein, a versatile organic molecule, Hydantoin, to modulate the crystallization of perovskite, is developed. Benefiting from the diverse functional groups, more spatially oriented perovskite films with high crystallinity are formed. This enhancement is accompanied by a conspicuous reduction in defect density, yielding efficiency of 25.66% (certified 25.15%), with superb environmental stability. Notably, under the standard measurement conditions (ISOS-L-1I), the maximum power point (MPP) output maintains 96.8% of the initial efficiency for 1600 h and exhibits excellent ion migration suppression. The synergistic regulation of crystallization and spatial orientation offers novel avenues for propelling perovskite solar cell (PSC) development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale, Vertically Aligned 2D Subnanochannel Arrays by a Smectic Liquid Crystal Network for High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically aligned 2D subnanochannel arrays in a smectic liquid crystal network is fabricated by photo&#8208;polymerization. As&#8208;prepared membrane demonstrates a power output of &#8776;22.5 W m&#8722;2 when mixing artificial river water and seawater based on its 2D directional nanochannels and high charge density. This work first presents the great potential of liquid crystal materials in osmotic energy conversion.








Abstract
The osmotic energy, an abundant renewable energy source, can be directly converted to electricity by nanofluidic devices with ion&#8208;selective membranes. 2D nanochannels constructed by nanosheets possess abundant lateral interfacial ion&#8208;exchange sites and exhibit great superiority in nanofluidic devices. However, the most accessible orientation of the 2D nanochannels is parallel to the membrane surface, undoubtedly resulting in the conductivity loss. Herein, first vertically aligned 2D subnanochannel arrays self&#8208;assembled by a smectic liquid crystal (LC) network that exhibit high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion are demonstrated. The 2D subnanochannel arrays are fabricated by in situ photopolymerization of monomers in the LC phase. The as&#8208;prepared membrane exhibits excellent water&#8208;resistance and mechanical strength. The 2D subnanochannels with excellent cation selectivity and conductivity show high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. The power density reaches up to about 22.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 with NaCl solution under a 50&#8208;fold concentration gradient, which is among with ultrahigh power density. This membrane design concept provides promising applications in osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>Building&#8208;Envelope&#8208;Inspired, Thermomechanically Robust All&#8208;Fiber Ceramic Meta&#8208;Aerogel for Temperature&#8208;Controlled Dominant Infrared Camouflage</title>

An all&#8208;fiber ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel mimicking the structure of a building envelope is fabricated. The prepared meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits high compressibility, extreme temperature&#8208;invariance of dynamic mechanical properties, superior thermal shock resistance, and infrared camouflage performance in the fields of national defense and aerospace.








Abstract
The unsatisfactory properties of ceramic aerogels when subjected to thermal shock, such as strength degradation and structural collapse, render them unsuitable for use at large thermal gradients or prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures. Here, a building&#8208;envelope&#8208;inspired design for fabricating a thermomechanically robust all&#8208;fiber ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel with interlocked fibrous interfaces and an interwoven cellular structure in the orthogonal directions is presented, which is achieved through a two&#8208;stage physical and chemical process. Inspired by the reinforced concrete building envelope, a solid foundation composed of fibrous frames is constructed and enhanced through supramolecular in situ self&#8208;assembly to achieve high compressibility, retaining over 90% of maximum stress under a considerable compressive strain of 50% for 10&#8239;000 cycles, and showing temperature&#8208;invariance when compressed at 60% strain within the range of &#8722;100 to 500 &#176;C. As a result of its distinct response to oscillation tolerance coupled with elastic recovery, the all&#8208;fiber ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits exceptional suitability for thermal shock resistance and infrared camouflage performance in cold (&#8722;196 &#176;C) and hot (1300 &#176;C) fields. This study provides an opportunity for developing ceramic aerogels for effective thermal management under extreme conditions.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Curable 3D Printing of Circularly Polarized Afterglow Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Monoliths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#160;(MOFs) nanoparticles with different afterglow times are prepared by combining chiral induction approach and auxiliary ligands regulation strategy, displaying tunable circularly polarized luminescence afterglow performance. Furthermore, the corresponding chiral MOFs nanoparticles are first prepared to various chiral monoliths by photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technology for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications.








Abstract
Developing coordination complexes (such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, MOFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is currently attracting tremendous attention and remains a significant challenge in achieving MOF with circularly polarized afterglow. Herein, MOFs&#8208;based circularly polarized afterglow is first reported by combining the chiral induction approach and tuning the afterglow times by using the auxiliary ligands regulation strategy. The obtained chiral R/S&#8208;ZnIDC, R/S&#8208;ZnIDC(bpy), and R/S&#8208;ZnIDC(bpe)(IDC = 1H&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, bpy = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine, bpe = trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl) ethylene) containing a similar structure unit display different afterglow times with 3, 1, and &lt;0.1&#160;s respectively which attribute to that the longer auxiliary ligand hinders the energy transfer through the hydrogen bonding. The obtained chiral complexes reveal a strong chiral signal, obvious photoluminescence afterglow feature, and strong CPL performance (glum up to 3.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2). Furthermore, the photo&#8208;curing 3D printing method is first proposed to prepare various chiral MOFs based monoliths from 2D patterns to 3D scaffolds for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. This work not only develops chiral complexes monoliths by photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technique but opens a new strategy to achieve tunable CPL afterglow in optical applications.

         <title>Topological Complex Charge Conservation in Nontrivial Z2 &#215; Z2 Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel conserved quantity for topological domain wall networks of a generic Z2 &#215; Z2&#160;order is discovered. Spin&#8208;polarized current generates and mobilizes Z2 &#215; Z2 domain walls in Sr2VO3FeAs, leading to merge, bifurcation, pair creation, and annihilation. Within these active dynamics, the product of the topological complex charges defined for domain wall vertices is conserved with a novel boundary&#8208;charge correspondence rule.








Abstract
Localized topological modes such as solitons, Majorana Fermions, and skyrmions are attracting great interest as robust information carriers for future devices. Here, a novel conserved quantity for topological domain wall networks of a Z2 &#215;&#160;Z2&#160;order generated with spin&#8208;polarized current in Sr2VO3FeAs is discovered. Domain walls are mobilized by the scanning tunneling current, which also observes in atomic scale active dynamics of domain wall vertices including merge, bifurcation, pair creation, and annihilation. Within this dynamics, the product of the topological complex charges defined for domain wall vertices is conserved with a novel boundary&#8208;charge correspondence rule. These results may open an avenue toward topological electronics based on domain wall vertices in generic Z2 &#215;&#160;Z2&#160;systems.

         <title>Stretch&#8208;Induced Conductivity Enhancement in Highly Conductive and Tough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive and tough hydrogels composed of liquid metal (LM), silver nanowires (AgNWs), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are constructed. The stretch&#8208;induced orientations of AgNWs, deformable LM, and PVA nanocrystalline form conductive pathways and enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels, including ultimate fracture stress, strain, toughness, and dramatically enhance the electrical conductivity (from 4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 24 S m&#8722;1 at 4200% strain).








Abstract
The resistance of gels and elastomers increases significantly with tensile strain, which reduces conductive stability and restricts their use in stable and reliable electronics. Here, highly conductive tough hydrogels composed of silver nanowires (AgNWs), liquid metal (LM), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are fabricated. The stretch&#8208;induced orientations of AgNWs, deformable LM, and PVA nanocrystalline create conductive pathways, enhancing the mechanical properties of the hydrogels, including increased ultimate fracture stress (13&#8208;33&#160;MPa), strain (3000&#8211;5300%), and toughness (390.9&#8211;765.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Notably, the electrical conductivity of the hydrogels is significantly improved from 4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 24 S m&#8722;1 when stretched to 4200% strain, representing a 6000&#8208;fold enhancement. The incorporation of PVA nanocrystalline, deformable LM, and AgNWs effectively mitigates stress concentration at the crack tip, thereby conferring crack propagation insensitivity and fatigue resistance to the hydrogels. Moreover, the hydrogels are designed with a reversible crosslinking network, allowing for water&#8208;induced recycling.

         <title>Conversion of Layered WS2 Crystals into Mixed&#8208;Domain Electrochemical Catalysts by Plasma&#8208;Assisted Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports an approach to maximize the electrocatalytic performance of mechanically exfoliated WS2 through sequential plasma treatments. This dry process can spatially tune the level of surface oxidation as well as the concentration of sulfur vacancies such that compositionally graded, mixed&#8208;domain electrochemical catalysts induced hydrogen evolution reaction performance greater than platinum with high stability over centimeter&#8208;scale areas.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting is crucial to generate clean hydrogen fuel, but implementation at an industrial scale remains limited due to dependence on expensive platinum (Pt)&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, an all&#8208;dry process to transform electrochemically inert bulk WS2 into a multidomain electrochemical catalyst that enables scalable and cost&#8208;effective implementation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis is reported. Direct dry transfer of WS2 flakes to a gold thin film deposited on a silicon substrate provides a general platform to produce the working electrodes for HER with tunable charge transfer resistance. By treating the mechanically exfoliated WS2 with sequential Ar&#8208;O2 plasma, mixed domains of WS2, WO3, and tungsten oxysulfide form on the surfaces of the flakes, which gives rise to a superior HER with much greater long&#8208;term stability and steady&#8208;state activity compared to Pt. Using density functional theory, ultraefficient atomic sites formed on the constituent nanodomains are identified, and the quantification of atomic&#8208;scale reactivities and resulting HER activities fully support the experimental observations.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm IrRuNiMoCo High&#8208;Entropy Alloy with Iridium&#8208;Rich Medium&#8208;Entropy Oxide Shell to Boost Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles with iridium&#8208;rich medium&#8208;entropy oxides shell exhibit unprecedented activity and stability in proton exchange membrane electrolyzer. The lattice distortion and slow diffusion effect retard the migration and dissolution of the transition metals, thus enhancing the corrosion resistance.








Abstract
Ensuring high catalytic activity and durability at low iridium&#160;(Ir)usage is still a big challenge for the development of electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Here, a rapid liquid&#8208;reduction combined with surface galvanic replacement strategy is reported to synthesize the sub 2&#160;nm high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles featured with Ir&#8208;rich IrRuNiMo medium&#8208;entropy oxide shell (Ir&#8208;MEO) and a IrRuCoNiMo HEA core (HEA@Ir&#8208;MEO). Advanced spectroscopies reveal that the Ir&#8208;rich MEO shell inhibits the severe structural evolution of transition metals upon the OER, thus guaranteeing the structural stability. In situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, activation energy analysis and theoretical calculations unveil that the OER on HEA@Ir&#8208;MEO follows an adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway, where the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step is substantially lowered. The optimized catalyst delivers the excellent performance (1.85&#160;V/3.0 A cm&#8722;2@80&#160;&#176;C), long&#8208;term stability (&gt;500 h@1.0 Acm&#8722;2), and low energy consumption (3.98&#160;kWh Nm&#8722;3 H2 @1.0 A cm&#8722;2) in PEMWE with low Ir usage of &#8776;0.4 mg cm&#8722;2, realizing the dramatical reduction of hydrogen (H2) production cost to 0.88 dollar&#160;per kg (H2).

         <title>Enhancing the Thermoelectric Properties of Conjugated Polymers by Suppressing Dopant&#8208;Induced Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By creating well&#8208;defined molecular cavities in P3HT&#8208;based random copolymers, the dopant&#8208;induced disorder is suppressed upon IEx&#8208;doing of the polymers, leading to optimized molecular packing with minimized structural disorder, resulting in electrical conductivities in excess of 400&#160;S cm&#8722;1 and power factor of &gt;16&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, ranking them the highest ever reports for P3HT&#8208;based polymers without chain alignment.








Abstract
Doping is a crucial strategy to enhance the performance of various organic electronic devices. However, in many cases, the random distribution of dopants in conjugated polymers leads to the disruption of the polymer microstructure, severely constraining the achievable performance of electronic devices. Here, it is shown that by ion&#8208;exchange doping polythiophene&#8208;based P[(3HT)1&#8208;x&#8208;stat&#8208;(T)x] (x&#160;=&#160;0 (P1), 0.12 (P2), 0.24 (P3), and 0.36 (P4)), remarkably high electrical conductivity of &gt;400&#160;S cm&#8722;1 and power factor of &gt;16&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 are achieved for the random copolymer P3, ranking it among highest ever reported for unaligned P3HT&#8208;based films, significantly higher than that of P1 (&lt;40&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, &lt;4&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2). Although both polymers exhibit comparable field&#8208;effect transistor hole mobilities of &#8776;0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 in the pristine state, after doping, Hall effect measurements indicate that P3 exhibits a large Hall mobility up to 1.2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, significantly outperforming that of P1 (0.06&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). GIWAXS measurement determines that the in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance of doped P3 is 3.44&#160;&#197;, distinctly shorter than that of doped P1 (3.68&#160;&#197;). These findings contribute to resolving the long&#8208;standing dopant&#8208;induced&#8208;disorder issues in P3HT and serve as an example for achieving fast charge transport in highly doped polymers for efficient electronics.

Although both polymers exhibit comparable field-effect transistor hole mobilities of &#8776;0.1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the pristine state, after doping, Hall effect measurements indicate that P3 exhibits a large Hall mobility up to 1.2&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly outperforming that of P1 (0.06&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). GIWAXS measurement determines that the in-plane &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking distance of doped P3 is 3.44&#160;&#197;, distinctly shorter than that of doped P1 (3.68&#160;&#197;). These findings contribute to resolving the long-standing dopant-induced-disorder issues in P3HT and serve as an example for achieving fast charge transport in highly doped polymers for efficient electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ingestible Artificial Urinary Biomarker Probes for Urine Test of Gastrointestinal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingestible artificial urinary biomarker probe can specifically react with cancer biomarkers in colon tumors and subsequently release renal&#8208;clearable small tetrazine fragments, allowing for fluorescence turn&#8208;on urine detection via bioorthogonal reaction with a trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged fluorophore.








Abstract
Although colorectal cancer diagnosed at an early stage shows high curability, methods simultaneously possessing point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing ability and high sensitivity are limited. Here, an orally deliverable biomarker&#8208;activatable probe (termed as HATS) for early detection of orthotopic tumors via remote urinalysis is presented. To enable its oral delivery to the colon, HATS is designed to have remarkable resistance to acidity and digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine and negligible intestinal absorption. Upon reaction with a cancer biomarker in the colon segment, HATS releases a small fragment of tetrazine that can transverse the intestinal barrier, enter blood circulation, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to urine. Subsequently, the urinary tetrazine fragment is detected by bioorthogonal reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged resorufin (TCO&#8208;Reso) to afford a rapid and specific fluorescence enhancement of TCO&#8208;Reso. Such signal readout is correlated with the urinary tetrazine concentration and thus measures the level of cancer biomarkers in the colon. HATS&#8208;based optical urinalysis detects orthotopic colon tumors two weeks earlier than clinical serological tests and can be developed to a point&#8208;of&#8208;care paper test. Thereby, HATS&#8208;based urinalysis provides a non&#8208;invasive and sensitive approach to cancer screening at low&#8208;resource settings.

         <title>A Multimodal Self&#8208;Propelling Tensegrity Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid tensegrity structure (HTS) is constructed by integrating thermally responsive cables, nonresponsive cables, and stiff rods. The HTS can continuously extract energy from the hot surface and undertake self&#8208;propelling rolling. By adjusting the position of the active cables, the HTS can roll in different repetitive locomotive modes autonomously in response to thermal stimuli.








Abstract
Tensegrity structure is composed of tensile cables and compressive rods, offering high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;mass ratio, deploy ability, and excellent energy damping capability. The active and dynamic tensegrity designs demonstrate great potential for soft robots. In previous designs, the movement has relied on carefully controlled input power or manually controlled light irradiation, limiting their potential applications. Here, a hybrid tensegrity structure (HTS) is constructed by integrating thermally responsive cables, nonresponsive cables, and stiff rods. The HTS can self&#8208;propel continuously on a hot surface due to its unique geometry. The HTS allows for the easy achievement of multimodal self&#8208;propelled locomotive modes, which has been challenging for previously demonstrated self&#8208;propelling structures. Additionally, using Velcro tapes to adhere the rods and cables together, a modulable and reassemblable HTS is created. The HTS introduced in this study presents a new strategy and offers a large design space for constructing self&#8208;propelling and modulable robots.

         <title>Sequential Dual Alignments Introduce Synergistic Effect on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Platelets for Superior Thermal Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platelet partial alignment by a directional shear force facilitates the axial rotation of the platelets for subsequent planar alignment under an external&#8208;force&#8208;couple&#8208;induced torque, and the sequential dual alignments result in a synergistic alignment effect. The realization of planar alignment of hexagonal boron nitride platelets is reported using the sequential dual&#8208;alignment approach when printing in a yield&#8208;stress support bath.








Abstract
Planarly aligning 2D platelets is challenging due to their additional orientational freedom compared to 1D materials. This study reports a sequential dual&#8208;alignment approach, employing an extrusion&#8208;printing&#8208;induced shear force and rotating&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced force couple for platelet planarly alignment in a yield&#8208;stress support bath. It is hypothesized that the partial alignment induced by a directional shear force facilitates subsequent axial rotation of the platelets for planar alignment under an external force couple, resulting in a synergistic alignment effect. This sequential dual&#8208;alignment approach achieves better planar alignment of 2D modified hexagonal boron nitride (mhBN). Specifically, the thermal conductivity of the 40 wt% mhBN/epoxy composite is significantly higher (692%) than that of unaligned composites, surpassing the cumulative effect of individual methods (only 133%) with a 5 times more synergistic effect. For 30, 40, and 50 wt% mhBN composites, the thermal conductivity values (5.9, 9.5, and 13.8&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) show considerable improvement compared to the previously reported highest values (5.3, 6.6, and 8.6&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Additionally, a 3D mhBN/epoxy heat sink is printed and evaluated to demonstrate the feasibility of device fabrication. The approach enables the planar alignment of electrically or thermally conducting 2D fillers during 3D fabrication.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Thermal&#8208;Shock Resistance Enabled by Radiative Cooling and Latent Heat Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;function strategy composed of radiative cooling and latent heat storage is proposed to enable thermal&#8208;shock resistance performance. The radiative film allows excellent subambient performance. When subjected to thermal shock, the dual&#8208;function cooler demonstrates a pinning effect of huge temperature drop by isothermal heat absorption. The molten phase change materials provide heat&#8208;time transfer effect by converting heat to delayed release.









Abstract
Radiative cooling technology is well known for its subambient temperature cooling performance under sunlight radiation. However, the intrinsic maximum cooling power of radiative cooling limits the performance when the objects meet the thermal shock. Here, a dual&#8208;function strategy composed of radiative cooling and latent heat storage simultaneously enabling the efficient subambient cooling and high&#8208;efficiency thermal&#8208;shock resistance performance is proposed. The electrospinning and absorption&#8208;pressing methods are used to assemble the dual&#8208;function cooler. The high sunlight reflectivity and high mid&#8208;infrared emissivity of radiative film allow excellent subambient temperature of 5.1&#160;&#176;C. When subjected the thermal shock, the dual&#8208;function cooler demonstrates a pinning effect of huge temperature drop of 39&#160;&#176;C and stable low&#8208;temperature level by isothermal heat absorption compared with the traditional radiative cooler. The molten phase change materials provide the heat&#8208;time transfer effect by converting thermal&#8208;shock heat to the delayed preservation. This strategy paves a powerful way to protect the objects from thermal accumulation and high&#8208;temperature damage, expanding the applications of radiative cooling and latent heat storage technologies.

         <title>Polymerizing M&#8208;Series Acceptors for Efficient Polymer Solar Cells: Effect of the Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear&#8208;shaped ADA&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptor (SMA) is shown to be more advantageous to build polymer acceptors with high charge transport and photovoltaic properties than the banana&#8208;shaped one. The polymer acceptor based on the linear&#8208;shape ADA&#8208;type SMA exhibits a high efficiency of 15.65% in binary devices and an outstanding efficiency of 18.0% in ternary devices with a PM6:M36 host blend.








Abstract
Currently, high&#8208;performance polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (PSMAs) based on ADA&#8208;type SMAs are still rare and greatly demanded for polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, two novel regioregular PSMAs (PW&#8208;Se and PS&#8208;Se) are designed and synthesized by using centrosymmetric (linear&#8208;shaped) and axisymmetric (banana&#8208;shaped) ADA&#8208;type SMAs as the main building blocks, respectively. It is demonstrated that photovoltaic performance of the PSMAs can be significantly improved by optimizing the configuration of ADA&#8208;type SMAs. Compared to the axisymmetric SMA&#8208;based polymer (PS&#8208;Se), PW&#8208;Se using a centrosymmetric SMA as the main building block exhibits better backbone coplanarity thereby resulting in bathochromically shifted absorption with a higher absorption coefficient, tighter interchain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and more favorable blend film morphology. As a result, enhanced and more&#8208;balanced charge transport, better exciton dissociation, and reduced charge recombination are achieved for PW&#8208;Se&#8208;based devices with PM6 as polymer donor. Benefiting from these positive factors, the optimal PM6:PW&#8208;Se&#8208;based device exhibits a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.65% compared to the PM6:PS&#8208;Se&#8208;based device (8.90%). Furthermore, incorporation of PW&#8208;Se as a third component in the binary active layer of PM6:M36 yields ternary devices with an outstanding PCE of 18.0%, which is the highest value for PSCs based on ADA&#8208;type SMAs, to the best of the knowledge.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Diffraction Correlation of Quantum Emitters and Local Strain Fields in Strain&#8208;Engineered WSe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The positions of spectrally pure quantum emitters in nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are mapped to the underlying strain field with a resolution below the diffraction limit (&#8776;30&#160;nm). The quantum emitters are displaced from the local strain maxima by an average distance of 240&#160;nm, which contradicts the assumption that strain&#8208;induced quantum emitters are concentrated at the local strain maxima.








Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in atomically thin metal dichalcogenides is a useful method for realizing single&#8208;photon emitters (SPEs) for quantum technologies. Correlating SPE position with local strain topography is challenging due to localization inaccuracies from the diffraction limit. Currently, SPEs are assumed to be positioned at the highest strained location and are typically identified by randomly screening narrow&#8208;linewidth emitters, of which only a few are spectrally pure. In this work, hyperspectral quantum emitter localization microscopy is used to locate 33 SPEs in nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers with sub&#8208;diffraction&#8208;limit resolution (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and correlate their positions with the underlying strain field via image registration. In this system, spectrally pure emitters are not concentrated at the highest strain location due to spectral contamination; instead, isolable SPEs are distributed away from points of peak strain with an average displacement of 240&#160;nm. These observations point toward a need for a change in the design rules for strain&#8208;engineered SPEs and constitute a key step toward realizing next&#8208;generation quantum optical architectures.

         <title>Pyroelectric Photoconductive Diode for Highly Sensitive and Fast DUV Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of highly sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors is a huge challenge. This work proposes a strategy to boost detection performance by coupling the interface pyroelectric effect with the photoconductive effect based on engineered polycrystal Ga&#8208;rich GaOx Schottky photodiode (i.e., pyroelectric photoconductive diodes). The pyroelectric photoconductive diodes exhibit ultrahigh detection performance for deep ultraviolet and X&#8208;ray light.








Abstract
Detecting high&#8208;energy photons from the deep ultraviolet (DUV) to X&#8208;rays is vital in security, medicine, industry, and science. Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors exhibit great potential for detecting high&#8208;energy photons. However, the implementation of highly sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors based on WBG semiconductors has been a huge challenge due to the inevitable deep level traps and the lack of appropriate device structure engineering. Here, a sensitive and fast pyroelectric photoconductive diode (PPD), which couples the interface pyroelectric effect with the photoconductive effect based on tailored polycrystal Ga&#8208;rich GaOx (PGR&#8208;GaOx) Schottky photodiode, is first proposed. The PPD device exhibits ultrahigh detection performance for DUV and X&#8208;ray light. The responsivity for DUV light and sensitivity for X&#8208;ray are up to 104 A W&#8722;1 and 105 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. Especially, the interface pyroelectric effect induced by polar symmetry in the depletion region of the PGR&#8208;GaOx can significantly improve the response speed of the device by 105 times. Furthermore, the potential of the device is demonstrated for imaging enhancement systems with low power consumption and high sensitivity. This work fully excavates the potential of the pyroelectric effect for detectors and provides a novel design strategy to achieve sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors.

         <title>Deciphering the Performance Enhancement, Cell Failure Mechanism, and Amelioration Strategy of Sodium Storage in Metal Chalcogenides&#8208;Based Andes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) materials can achieve excellent performance in ether&#8208;based electrolyte with Cu current collector but suffers from inevitable cycle life termination. It is delved into the origins of performance enhancement and the mechanisms behind cell failure in TMC&#8208;based anodes when paired with ether&#8208;based electrolytes, while also proposed effective strategies to mitigate such failures.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) emerge as promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), heralding a new era of energy storage solutions. Despite their potential, the mechanisms underlying their performance enhancement and susceptibility to failure in ether&#8208;based electrolytes remain elusive. This study delves into these aspects, employing CoS2 electrodes as a case in point to elucidate the phenomena. The investigation reveals that CoS2 undergoes a unique irreversible and progressive solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid phase transition from its native state to sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), and ultimately to a Cu1.8S/Co composite, accompanied by a gradual morphological transformation from microspheres to a stable 3D porous architecture. This reconstructed 3D porous structure is pivotal for its exceptional Na+ diffusion kinetics and resilience to cycling&#8208;induced stress, being the main reason for ultrastable cycling and ultrahigh rate capability. Nonetheless, the CoS2 electrode suffers from an inevitable cycle life termination due to the microshort&#8208;circuit induced by Na metal corrosion and separator degradation. Through a comparative analysis of various TMCs, a predictive framework linking electrode longevity is established to electrode potential and Gibbs free energy. Finally, the cell failure issue is significantly mitigated at a material level (graphene encapsulation) and cell level (polypropylene membrane incorporation) by alleviating the NaPSs shuttling and microshort&#8208;circuit.

         <title>Assembly of Interfacial Polyelectrolyte Complexation Fibers with Mineralization Gradient for Physiologically&#8208;Inspired Ligament Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a physiologically&#8208;inspired ligament regeneration with biomimetic hierarchical architecture, viscoelasticity, and enthesis&#8208;like mineralization gradient. Through these advancements, this research aims at improving clinical outcomes, facilitating patient recovery, and provide a long&#8208;lasting and effective solution for ligament injuries.








Abstract
Current synthetic grafts for ligament rupture repair often fail to integrate well with the surrounding biological tissue, leading to complications such as graft wear, fatigue, and subsequent re&#8208;rupture. To address this medical challenge, this study aims at advancing the development of a biological ligament through the integration of physiologically&#8208;inspired principles and tissue engineering strategies. In this study, interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation (IPC) spinning technique, along with a custom&#8208;designed collection system, to fabricate a hierarchical scaffold mimicking native ligament structure, is utilized. To emulate the bone&#8208;ligament interface and alleviate stress concentration, a hydroxyapatite (HAp) mineral gradient is strategically introduced near both ends of the scaffold to enhance interface integration and diminish the risk of avulsion rupture. Biomimetic viscoelasticity is successfully displayed to provide similar mechanical support to native ligamentous tissue under physiological conditions. By introducing the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and conducting mesenchymal stem cells transplantation, the regenerative potential of the synthetic ligament is significantly amplified. This pioneering study offers a multifaceted solution combining biomimetic materials, regenerative therapies, and advanced techniques to potentially transform ligament rupture treatment.

         <title>Full&#8208;Length Single Protein Molecules Tracking and Counting in Thin Silicon Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid full&#8208;length, single protein molecules separation, tracking, and identification in ultra&#8208;high aspect ratio silicon devices. Proteins are tagged by chemo&#8208;selective dual amino&#8208;acid specific labels and are electrophoretically separated by their mass/charge in custom thin silicon channel with subwavelength height. This approach allows the analysis of thousands of individual proteins within a few minutes by tracking their motion during the migration.








Abstract
Emerging single&#8208;molecule protein sensing techniques are ushering in a transformative era in biomedical research. Nevertheless, challenges persist in realizing ultra&#8208;fast full&#8208;length protein sensing, including loss of molecular integrity due to protein fragmentation, biases introduced by antibodies affinity, identification of proteoforms, and low throughputs. Here, a single&#8208;molecule method for parallel protein separation and tracking is introduced, yielding multi&#8208;dimensional molecular properties used for their identification. Proteins are tagged by chemo&#8208;selective dual amino&#8208;acid specific labels and are electrophoretically separated by their mass/charge in custom&#8208;designed thin silicon channel with subwavelength height. This approach allows analysis of thousands of individual proteins within a few minutes by tracking their motion during the migration. The power of the method is demonstrated by quantifying a cytokine panel for host&#8208;response discrimination between viral and bacterial infections. Moreover, it is shown that two clinically&#8208;relevant splice isoforms of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be accurately quantified from human serum samples. Being non&#8208;destructive and compatible with full&#8208;length intact proteins, this method opens up ways for antibody&#8208;free single&#8208;protein molecule quantification.

         <title>Rational Design of New Conjugated Polymers with Main Chain Chirality for Efficient Optoelectronic Devices: Carbo[6]Helicene and Indacenodithiophene Copolymers as Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of conjugated polymers (CPs) with main chain chirality and their incorporation in devices is scarce despite promising added value. In this work, the incorporation of enantiopure helicenes into a polymer backbone results in improved performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, up to 20% increase compared to the homopolymer or the racemic analog polymers.








Abstract
The unique properties of conjugated polymers (CPs) in various optoelectronic applications are mainly attributed to their different self&#8208;assembly processes and superstructures. Various methods are utilized to tune and control CP structure and properties with less attention paid to the use of chirality. CPs with main chain chirality are rare and their microscopic and macroscopic properties are still unknown. In this work, the first experimental results are provided along these lines by synthesizing a series of racemic and enantiopure CPs containing statistical and alternating carbo[6]helicene and indacenodithiophene moieties and evaluating their microscopic (optical, energy levels) and macroscopic properties (hole mobilities, photovoltaic performance). It is demonstrated that a small statistical insertion of either the racemic or enantiopure helicene into the polymer backbone finely tunes the microscopic and macroscopic properties as a function of the statistical content. The microscopic properties of the enantiopure versus the racemic polymers with the same helicene loading remain similar. On the contrary, the macroscopic properties, and more interestingly those between the two enantiomeric forms, are altered as a function of the statistical content. Once incorporated into a solar cell device, these chiral CPs display better performance in their enantiopure versus racemic forms.

         <title>Manipulating Hetero&#8208;Nanowire Films for Flexible and Multifunctional Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible multifunctional thermoelectric device with radiative cooling performance is fabricated by the interface assembly and in situ reaction of nanowires. The thermoelectric device can sense temperature (object and ambient), heat proximity, thermal conductivity of the object, and airflow, where the encapsulating materials endow the device with radiative cooling performance and extreme environmental tolerance.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices hold significant promise in wearable electronics owing to their capacity for green energy generation, temperature sensing, and comfortable wear. However, the simultaneous achievement of excellent multifunctional sensing and power generation poses a challenge in these devices. Here, ordered tellurium&#8208;based hetero&#8208;nanowire films are designed for flexible and multifunctional thermoelectric devices by optimizing the Seebeck coefficient and power factor. The obtained devices can efficiently detect both object and environment temperature, thermal conductivity, heat proximity, and airflow. In addition, combining the thermoelectric units with radiative cooling materials exhibits remarkable thermal management capabilities, preventing device overheating and avoiding degradation in power generation. Impressively, this multifunctional electronics exhibits excellent resistance in extreme low earth orbit environments. The fabrication of such thermoelectric devices provides innovative insights into multimodal sensing and energy harvesting.

         <title>A Freestanding, Dissolution&#8208; and Diffusion&#8208;Limiting, Flexible Sulfur Electrode Enables High Specific Capacity at High Mass Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize a practically battery with high energy density, it is crucial to achieve stable and high&#8208;loading S electrodes (&gt;5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). A freestanding electrode with dissolution&#8208;limiting and diffusion&#8208;blocking functions is introduced for flexible Li&#8211;S batteries. This design offers an unconventional improvement in specific capacity at higher mass loading, excellent cycling stability, and remarkable energy density.








Abstract
The acquisition of stable and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity S cathodes over 10&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 is a critical and indispensable step to realize the high energy density configuration. However, increasing the areal capacity of S cathodes often deteriorates the specific capacity and stability due to the aggravated dissolution of S and diffusion of solvable polysulfides in the thick electrode. Herein, the design of a freestanding composite cathode that leverages 3D covalent binding sites and chemical adsorption environment to offer dissolution&#8208;limiting and diffusion&#8208;blocking functions of S species is reported. By employing this architecture, the coin cell exhibits excellent cycling stability and an exceptional specific capacity of 1444.3&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 (13&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2), and the pouch cell configuration manifests a noteworthy areal capacity exceeding 11&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2. This performance is coupled with excellent flexibility, demonstrated through consecutive bending cycle tests, even at a sulfur loading of 9.00&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This study lays the foundation for the development of flexible Li&#8211;S batteries with increased loading capacities and exceptional performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Enabled Printable Asymmetric Self&#8208;Insulated Stretchable Conductor for Human Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel printable, flexible material composed of conducting polymer and liquid metal, which is capable of self&#8208;assembly upon printing, producing asymmetric highly conductive stretchable conductors for human interface.








Abstract
Soft and stretchable conductors with high electrical conductivity and tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties are crucial for both on&#8208;skin and implantable electronic devices. Liquid metal&#8208;based conductors hold great promise due to their metallic conductivity and minimal stiffness. However, the surface oxidation of liquid metal particles in polymeric matrices poses a challenge in forming a continuous pathway for highly conductive elastic composites. Here, it is reported a printable composite material based on liquid metal and conducting polymer that undergoes a self&#8208;assembly process, achieving high conductivity (2089 S cm&#8722;1) in the bottom surface while maintaining an insulated top surface, high stretchability (&gt;800%), and a modulus akin to human skin tissue. This material is further applied to fabricate skin&#8208;interfaced strain sensors and electromyogram sensors through 3D printing.

         <title>A Biomimetic &#8220;Salting Out&#8212;Alignment&#8212;Locking&#8221; Tactic to Design Strong and Tough Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural spider silk dragline producing process, a &#8220;salting out&#8212;alignment&#8212;locking&#8221; tactic (SALT) is developed in this paper. The obtained strength and toughness of gelatin hydrogels through SALT hold records for the previously reported gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and are close to the tendons. The SALT also exhibits universality toward other salts and polymer systems.








Abstract
Recently, hydrogel&#8208;based soft materials have demonstrated huge potential in soft robotics, flexible electronics as well as artificial skins. Although various methods are developed to prepare tough and strong hydrogels, it is still challenging to simultaneously enhance the strength and toughness of hydrogels, especially for protein&#8208;based hydrogels. Herein, a biomimetic &#8220;salting out&#8212;alignment&#8212;locking&#8221; tactic (SALT) is introduced for enhancing mechanical properties through the synergy of alignment and the salting out effect. As a typical example, tensile strength and modulus of initially brittle gelatin hydrogels increase 940 folds to 10.12&#160;&#177;&#160;0.50&#160;MPa and 2830 folds to 34.26&#160;&#177;&#160;3.94&#160;MPa, respectively, and the toughness increases up to 1785 folds to 14.28&#160;&#177;&#160;3.13&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. The obtained strength and toughness hold records for the previously reported gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and are close to the tendons. It is further elucidated that the salting out effect engenders hydrophobic domains, while prestretching facilitates chain alignment, both synergistically contributing to the outstanding mechanical properties. It is noteworthy that the SALT demonstrates remarkable versatility across different salt types and polymer systems, thus opening up new avenues for engineering strong, tough, and stiff hydrogels.

         <title>From Fluorescence&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Lightening&#8208;Printing&#8208;Assisted Conductive Adhesive Nanocomposite Hydrogels toward Wearable Interactive Optical Information&#8208;Electronic Strain Sensors</title>

Through the fluorescence&#8208;transfer printing of an aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active ink onto a conductive adhesive resilient nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel in different strains with nested multiple symbolic information, a wearable interactive optical information&#8208;electronic strain sensor is developed which can achieve body&#8208;joint&#8208;movement&#8208;mediated strain&#8208;dependent fluorescent information and electrical signal changes.








Abstract
The interactive flexible device, which monitors the human motion in optical and electrical synergistic modes, has attracted growing attention recently. The incorporation of information attribute within the optical signal is deemed advantageous for improving the interactive efficiency. Therefore, the development of wearable optical information&#8208;electronic strain sensors holds substantial promise, but integrating and synergizing various functions and realizing strain&#8208;mediated information transformation keep challenging. Herein, an amylopectin (AP) modified nanoclay/polyacrylamide&#8208;based nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel and an aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active ink are fabricated. Through the fluorescence&#8208;transfer printing of the ink onto the hydrogel film in different strains with nested multiple symbolic information, a wearable interactive fluorescent information&#8208;electronic strain sensor is developed. In the sensor, the nanoclay plays a synergistic &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;three&#8208;birds&#8221; role, contributing to &#8220;lightening&#8221; fluorescence (&#8776;80 times emission intensity enhancement), ionic conductivity, and excellent stretchability (&gt;1000%). The sensor has high biocompatibility, resilience (elastic recovery ratio: 97.8%), and strain sensitivity (gauge factor (GF): 10.9). Additionally, the AP endows the sensor with skin adhesiveness. The sensor can achieve electrical monitoring of human joint movements while displaying interactive fluorescent information transformation. This research poses an efficient strategy to develop multifunctional materials and provides a general platform for achieving next&#8208;generation interactive devices with prospective applications in wearable devices, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

         <title>Achieving Zero&#8208;Temperature Coefficient Point Behavior by Defect Passivation for Temperature&#8208;Immune Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zero&#8208;temperature coefficient (ZTC) point behavior is first achieved by eliminating Fermi pinning using a defect passivation strategy, which complements the ZTC point theory and achieves temperature&#8208;immune organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The temperature&#8208;immune output current can be realized in the variable temperature bias voltage test over 50000 s by biasing OFETs at ZTC points.








Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have broad prospects in biomedical, sensor, and aerospace applications. However, obtaining temperature&#8208;immune OFETs is difficult because the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs) are temperature&#8208;sensitive. The zero&#8208;temperature coefficient (ZTC) point behavior can be used to achieve a temperature&#8208;immune output current; however, it is difficult to achieve in organic devices with thermal activation characteristics, according to the existing ZTC point theory. Here, the Fermi pinning in OSCs is eliminated using the defect passivation strategy, making the Fermi level closer to the tail state at low temperatures; thus threshold voltage (VT) is negatively correlated with temperature. ZTC point behaviors in OFETs are achieved by compensation between VT and mobility at different temperatures to improve its temperature immunity. A temperature&#8208;immune output current can be realized in a variable&#8208;temperature bias voltage test over 50000&#160;s by biasing the device at the ZTC point. This study provides an effective solution for temperature&#8208;immune OFETs and inspiration for their practical application.

         <title>Multifunctional Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Ionohydrogels toward Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal approach for synthesizing polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;reinforced ionic liquid&#8208;based gels (ILGs) and builds up an efficient bridge between them. The potential of POMs and ILGs across numerous fields, combined with structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance elucidation, has led to the identification of superior POMs&#8208;improved ILGs suitable for the fabrication of self&#8208;powered sensing systems.








Abstract

The potential of POMs and ILGs across numerous fields, combined with structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance elucidation, has led to the identification of superior POMs-improved ILGs suitable for the fabrication of self-powered sensing systems.

         <title>Visible Microfluidic Deprotonation for Aramid Nanofibers as Building Blocks of Cascade&#8208;Microfluidic&#8208;Processed Colloidal Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic deprotonation approach with an in situ observation function is proposed first to realize the continuous, scalable, efficient, and uniform production of aramid nanofibers. The kinetic exfoliation process is established quantificationally, bringing about appreciable prospects for the cascade&#8208;microfluidic&#8208;processed colloidal aerogels and providing inspiration for exfoliating any other nano&#8208;building blocks.








Abstract
&#160;Microfluidic deprotonation approach is proposed to realize continuous, scalable, efficient, and uniform production of aramid nanofibers (ANFs)&#160;by virtue of large specific surface area, high mixing efficiency, strong heat transfer capacity, narrow residence time distribution, mild laminar&#8208;flow process, and amplification&#8208;free effect of the microchannel reactor. By means of monitoring capabilities endowed by the high transparency of the microchannel, the kinetic exfoliation process of original aramid particles is in situ observed and the corresponding exfoliation mechanism is established quantificationally. The deprotonated time can be reduced from the traditional several days to 7 min for the final colloidal dispersion due to the synergistic effect between enhanced local shearing/mixing and the rotational motion of aramid particles in microchannel revealed by numerical simulations. Furthermore, the cascade microfluidic processing approach is used to make various ANF colloidal aerogels including aerogel fibers, aerogel films, and 3D&#8208;printed aerogel articles. Comprehensive characterizations show that these cascade&#8208;microfluidic&#8208;processed colloidal aerogels have identical features as those prepared in batch&#8208;style mode, revealing the versatile use value of these ANFs. This work achieves significant progress toward continuous and efficient production of ANFs, bringing about appreciable prospects for the practical application of ANF&#8208;based materials and providing inspiration for exfoliating any other nano&#8208;building blocks.

         <title>Projection Stereolithography 3D Printing High&#8208;Conductive Hydrogel for Flexible Passive Wireless Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A projection stereolithography 3D printable high&#8208;conductive hydrogel is developed, which enables customization of electronic circuits. Sealing the partially dehydrated hydrogel circuits can achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&#8722;1), stretchability and stability (&gt;1 month). Furthermore, the customized passive radio frequency identification tags are fabricated by assembling the printed antennas with commercial chips, which realize wireless sensing of eye movement.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based electronics have inherent similarities to biological tissues and hold potential for wearable applications. However, low conductivity, poor stretchability, nonpersonalizability, and uncontrollable dehydration during use limit their further development. In this study, projection stereolithography 3D printing high&#8208;conductive hydrogel for flexible passive wireless sensing is reported. The prepared photocurable silver&#8208;based hydrogel is rapidly planarized into antenna shapes on substrates using surface projection stereolithography. After partial dehydration, silver flakes within the circuits form sufficient conductive pathways to achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&#8722;1). By sealing the circuits to prevent further dehydration, the resistance remains stable when tensile strain is less than 100% for at least 30 days. Besides, the sealing materials provide versatile functionalities, such as stretchability and shape memory property. Customized flexible radio frequency identification tags are fabricated by integrating with commercial chips to complete the accurate recognition of eye movement, realizing passive wireless sensing.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Suppression with Long Chain Diammonium Alkane for High Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap and Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique intermediate phase engineering strategy is developed to overcome the residual of solvent in unannealed perovskite&#160;film by introducing octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diamine dihydroiodide. This helps to achieve single junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cells with high efficiency &gt;22% and outstanding stability, and achieve high performance 4&#8208;terminal all perovskite and large area perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite can construct tandem cells with narrow bandgap solar cells by adjusting the band gap to overcome the Shockley&#8722;Queisser limitation of single junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, WBG perovskites still suffer from severe nonradiative carrier recombination and large open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. Here, this work uses an in situ photoluminescence (PL) measurement to monitor the intermediate phase evolution and crystallization process via blade coating. This work reports a strategy to fabricate efficient and stable WBG perovskite solar cells through doping a long carbon chain molecule octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diamine dihydroiodide (ODADI). It is found that ODADI doping not only suppresses intermediate phases but also promote the crystallization of perovskite and passivate defects in blade coated 1.67&#160;eV WBG FA0.7Cs0.25MA0.05Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 perovskite films. As a result, the champion single junction inverted PSCs deliver the efficiencies of 22.06% and 19.63% for the active area of 0.07 and 1.02 cm2, respectively, which are the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in WBG PSCs by blade coating. The unencapsulated device demonstrates excellent stability in air, which maintains its initial efficiency at the maximum power points under constant AM 1.5G illumination in open air for nearly 500&#160;h. The resulting semitransparent WBG device delivers a high PCE of 20.06%, and the 4&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem device delivers a PCE of 28.35%.

         <title>Suppressing Element Inhomogeneity Enables 14.9% Efficiency CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental inhomogeneity caused by Cu&#8208;directional diffusion toward Mo(S,Se)2 layer is demonstrated to be the critical factor in the formation of secondary phases and defects. By suppressing the Cu&#8208;directional diffusion with a blocking layer, a remarkable efficiency of 14.9% is achieved, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 576 mV and a certified efficiency of 14.6%.








Abstract
Kesterites, Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1&#8722;x)4 (CZTSSe), solar cells suffer from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss due to the numerous secondary phases and defects. The prevailing notion attributes this issue to Sn&#8208;loss during the selenization. However, this work unveils that, instead of Sn&#8208;loss, elemental inhomogeneity caused by Cu&#8208;directional diffusion toward Mo(S,Se)2 layer is the critical factor in the formation of secondary phases and defects. This diffusion decreases the Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio to 53% at the bottom fine&#8208;grain layer, increasing the Sn&#8208;/Zn&#8208;related bulk defects. By suppressing the Cu&#8208;directional diffusion with a blocking layer, the crystal quality is effectively improved and the defect density is reduced, leading to a remarkable photovoltaic coversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.9% with a VOC of 576&#160;mV and a certified efficiency of 14.6%. The findings provide insights into element inhomogeneity, holding significant potential to advance the development of CZTSSe solar cells.

&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) loss due to the numerous secondary phases and defects. The prevailing notion attributes this issue to Sn-loss during the selenization. However, this work unveils that, instead of Sn-loss, elemental inhomogeneity caused by Cu-directional diffusion toward Mo(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer is the critical factor in the formation of secondary phases and defects. This diffusion decreases the Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio to 53% at the bottom fine-grain layer, increasing the Sn-/Zn-related bulk defects. By suppressing the Cu-directional diffusion with a blocking layer, the crystal quality is effectively improved and the defect density is reduced, leading to a remarkable photovoltaic coversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.9% with a &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 576&#160;mV and a certified efficiency of 14.6%. The findings provide insights into element inhomogeneity, holding significant potential to advance the development of CZTSSe solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced Formation of Pt&#8208;Based Intermetallics on MXene with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ti3C2Tx features plentiful surface terminations and abundant oxygen vacancies, which can electrostatically adsorb metal cations and provide channels to induce the interdiffusion of Pt/Fe atoms, synthesizing the ordered PtFe with small particle sizes. The strong metal&#8208;support interaction between PtFe and Ti3C2Tx can induce the charge redistribution through Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti and enhance electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
The Pt&#8208;based alloys can moderate the binding energies of oxygenated species on the catalytic surface, endowing the superior catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nevertheless, it is still challenging to explore general methods to synthesize structurally ordered intermetallics with uniform distributions. Herein, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction is employed to facilitate the interdiffusion of Pt/M atoms by establishing a tunnel of oxygen vacancy on ultrathin Ti3C2Tx (MXene) sheets, synthesizing the ordered PtFe, PtCo, PtZn, PdFe, PdZn intermetallics loaded onto Ti3C2Tx. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ generation of Ti&#8211;O from Ti3C2Tx could be bonded with Pt and forming Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti, resulting in charge redistribution through Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti structure. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the valuable charge redistribution can be observed at the interface and extended even to at the distance of two nanometers from the interface, which can modulate the Pt&#8211;Pt distance, optimize Pt&#8211;O binding energy and enhance intrinsic activity towards ORR. The strong coupling interaction between PtFe and Ti3C2Tx containing the titanium oxide layer endows the high stability of the composites. This work not only presents a general synthesis strategy for intermetallics but also provides a new insight that metal&#8208;support interaction is essential for the structural evolution of intermetallics on materials with oxygen vacancies.

         <title>Macromers for Encapsulating Perovskite Photovoltaics and Achieving High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macromer PIBA is carefully designed as a UV&#8208;curable adhesive for blanket encapsulating perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SC) without sacrificing the device efficiency. More importantly, the resultant CPIBA&#8208;BE pero&#8208;SCs retain &gt;95% of their initial efficiencies after the damp test (85% relative humidity) for 2000&#160;h.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are highly unstable even under trace water. Although the blanket encapsulation (BE) strategy applied in the industry can effectively block moisture invasion, the commercial UV&#8208;curable adhesives (UVCAs) for BE still trigger power conversion efficiency deterioration, and the degradation mechanism remains unknown. For the first time, the functions of commercial UVCAs are revealed in BE&#8208;processed pero&#8208;SCs, where the small&#8208;sized monomer easily permeates to the perovskite surface, forming an insulating barrier to block charge extraction, while the high&#8208;polarity moiety can destroy perovskite lattice. To solve these problems, a macromer, named PIBA is carefully designed, by grafting two acrylate terminal groups on the highly gastight polyisobutylene and realizes an increased molecular diameter as well as avoided high&#8208;polarity groups. The PIBA macromer can stabilize on pero&#8208;SCs and then sufficiently crosslink, forming a compact and stable network under UV light without sacrificing device performance during the BE process. The resultant BE devices show negligible efficiency loss after storage at 85% relative humidity for 2000&#160;h. More importantly, these devices can even reach ISO 20653:2013 Degrees of protection IPX7 standard when immersed in one&#8208;meter&#8208;deep water. This BE strategy shows good universality in enhancing the moisture stability of pero&#8208;SCs, irrespective of the perovskite composition or device structure.

         <title>Spatiotemporal&#8208;Controlled NIR&#8208;II Immune Agonist Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The article proposes a strategy to normalize immunotherapy by restoring immune responses within the tumor microenvironment and simultaneously blocking immune checkpoint pathways to prevent tumor cells from evading immune cell recognition. Furthermore, the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II photothermal response capability of degradable polymers enables localized spatiotemporal&#8208;controlled photothermal therapy and low&#8208;dose drug administration in tumors, enhancing biocompatibility and reducing systemic toxic side effects.








Abstract
The integration of nanomedicine and immunotherapy has presented a promising opportunity for the treatment of cancer and diverse diseases. However, achieving spatiotemporal controllable immunotherapy with excellent efficacy and safety performances remains a significant challenge. This study develops a biodegradable near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal response polymer nanoparticle (PTEQ) system. This platform exhibits intrinsic immunostimulatory properties while concurrently delivering siRNA for Programmed Death&#8208;Ligand 1 (siPD&#8208;L1), leveraging enhanced immune responses and immune checkpoint blockade for safe and effective cancer therapy. In the CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, PTEQ, as an immune stimulant, significantly boosts the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The PTEQ/siPD&#8208;L1+laser group not only initiates NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy but also promotes the activation and infiltration of T cells, M1 macrophage polarization, and maturation of dendritic cells in the TME, resulting in the complete elimination of tumors in 7/10 cases, achieving a 100% survival rate. In another in vivo vaccine experiment, all tumors on the right side are completely eliminated in the PTEQ/siPD&#8208;L1+laser group, reaching a 100% tumor eradication rate. These findings underscore the potential of this strategy to overcome the current immunotherapeutic limitations and achieve immune therapy normalization.

         <title>Regulating Surface&#8208;Passivator Binding Priority for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between passivator and perovskite is quantitatively assessed to optimize defect passivation. Through modulating adsorption configuration and coordination capacity of the passivator, the intense bonding with perfect perovskite is significantly reduced and leads to enhanced interaction with defects. The near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes without any external light&#8208;coupling achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 24.3% and ultralong operational lifetime.








Abstract
Suppressing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative losses through passivators is a prerequisite for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, the complex bonding between passivators and perovskites severely suppresses the passivation process, which still lacks comprehensive understanding. Herein, the number, category, and degree of bonds between different functional groups and the perovskite are quantitatively assessed to study the passivation dynamics. Functional groups with high electrostatic potential and large steric hindrance prioritize strong bonding with organic cations and halides on the perfect surface, leading to suppressed coordination with bulky defects. By modulating the binding priorities and coordination capacity, hindrance from the intense interaction with perfect perovskite is significantly reduced, leading to a more direct passivation process. Consequently, the near&#8208;infrared PeLED without external light out&#8208;coupling demonstrates a record external quantum efficiency of 24.3% at a current density of 42&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, the device exhibits a record&#8208;level&#8208;cycle ON/OFF switching of 20&#160;000 and ultralong half&#8208;lifetime of 1126.3&#160;h under 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. An in&#8208;depth understanding of the passivators can offer new insights into the development of high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

Herein, the number, category, and degree of bonds between different functional groups and the perovskite are quantitatively assessed to study the passivation dynamics. Functional groups with high electrostatic potential and large steric hindrance prioritize strong bonding with organic cations and halides on the perfect surface, leading to suppressed coordination with bulky defects. By modulating the binding priorities and coordination capacity, hindrance from the intense interaction with perfect perovskite is significantly reduced, leading to a more direct passivation process. Consequently, the near-infrared PeLED without external light out-coupling demonstrates a record external quantum efficiency of 24.3% at a current density of 42&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, the device exhibits a record-level-cycle ON/OFF switching of 20&#160;000 and ultralong half-lifetime of 1126.3&#160;h under 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. An in-depth understanding of the passivators can offer new insights into the development of high-performance PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum Nanoparticles Regulated V2C MXene Nanoplatforms with NIR&#8208;II Enhanced Nanozyme Effect for Photothermal and Chemodynamic Anti&#8208;Infective Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a nanoplatform based on Pt NPs anchored on V2C MXene (Pt@V2C), with excellent photothermal enhanced nanozyme strategy. Moreover, Pt@V2C is successfully applied to models of deep&#8208;seated subcutaneous infection and bacterial keratitis, and its therapeutic mechanism is analyzed through transcriptomics, laying the groundwork for the clinical application of V2C MXene with dual agents of photothermal and nanozymes.








Abstract
Given the challenge of multidrug resistance in antibiotics, non&#8208;antibiotic&#8211;dependent antibacterial strategies show promise for anti&#8208;infective therapy. V2C MXene&#8208;based nanomaterials have demonstrated strong biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) for photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the limitation of V2C MXene's laser irradiation to the near&#8208;infrared region I (NIR&#8208;I) restricts tissue penetration, making it difficult to achieve complete bacterial eradication with single&#8208;effect therapeutic strategies. To address this, Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) are attached to V2C, forming artificial nanoplatforms (Pt@V2C). Pt@V2C exhibits enhanced PCE (59.6%) and a longer irradiation laser (NIR&#8208;II) due to the surface plasmon resonance effect of Pt NPs and V2C. Notably, Pt@V2C displays dual enzyme&#8208;like activity with chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and NIR&#8208;II enhanced dual enzyme&#8208;like activity. The biocatalytic mechanism of Pt@V2C is elucidated using density functional theory. In an in vivo animal model, Pt@V2C effectively eliminates methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus from deep&#8208;seated tissues in subcutaneous abscesses and bacterial keratitis environments, accelerating abscess resolution and promoting wound and cornea healing through the synergistic effects of PTT/CDT. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that Pt@V2C targets inflammatory pathways, providing insight into its therapeutic mechanism. This study presents a promising therapeutic approach involving hyperthermia&#8208;amplified biocatalysis with Pt NPs and MXene nanocomposites.

         <title>Red Carbon Mediated Formation of Cu2O Clusters Dispersed on the Oxocarbon Framework by Fehling's Route and their Use for the Nitrate Electroreduction in Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, Cu2O clusters are obtained dispersedly on the oxocarbon framework after the Fehling's&#8208;like reaction during the mild annealing process of red carbon, leading to the reduction of Cu (II) predominantly to Cu2O. The covalent oxocarbon framework improves the stability of clusters, enabling their efficient nitrate electroreduction under acidic electrolytes with a high yield rate and Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The oligomers of carbon suboxide, known as red carbon, exhibit a highly conjugated structure and semiconducting properties. Upon mild heat treatment, it transforms into a carbonaceous framework rich in oxygen surface terminations, called oxocarbon. In this study, the abundant oxygen functionalities are harnessed as anchors to create oxocarbon&#8208;supported nanohybrid electrocatalysts. Starting with single atomic Cu (II) strongly coordinated to oxygen atoms on red carbon, the Fehling reaction leads to the formation of Cu2O clusters. Simultaneously, a covalent oxocarbon framework emerges via cross&#8208;linking, providing robust support for Cu2O clusters. Notably, the oxocarbon support effectively stabilizes Cu2O clusters of very small size, ensuring their high durability in acidic conditions and the presence of ammonia. The synthesized material exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity for nitrate reduction under acidic electrolyte conditions, with a high yield rate of ammonium (NH4+) at 3.31&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.5% at a potential of &#8722;0.4&#160;V (vs RHE).

         <title>Modulating Intracellular Dynamics for Optimized Intracellular Release and Transcytosis Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation into polyglutamine&#8208;paclitaxel conjugates with varying hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios and tertiary amine&#8208;oxide proportions aims (OPGA&#8208;PTX) to optimize an equilibrium between intracellular interception and transcytosis behaviors. OPPX emerges as a superior candidate, demonstrating selective trafficking to the Golgi apparatus for transcytosis and lysosomal sorting for cathepsin B&#8208;activated drug release, thereby achieving enhanced tumor penetration and efficient antitumor activity.








Abstract
Active transcytosis&#8208;mediated nanomedicine transport presents considerable potential in overcoming diverse delivery barriers, thereby facilitating tumor accumulation and penetration. Nevertheless, the persistent challenge lies in achieving a nuanced equilibrium between intracellular interception for drug release and transcytosis for tumor penetration. In this study, a comprehensive exploration is conducted involving a series of polyglutamine&#8208;paclitaxel conjugates featuring distinct hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios (HHR) and tertiary amine&#8208;oxide proportions (TP) (OPGA&#8208;PTX). The screening process, meticulously focused on delineating their subcellular distribution, transcytosis capability, and tumor penetration, unveils a particularly promising candidate denoted as OPPX, characterized by an HHR of 10:1 and a TP of 100%. OPPX, distinguished by its rapid cellular internalization through multiple endocytic pathways, selectively engages in trafficking to the Golgi apparatus for transcytosis to facilitate accumulation within and penetration throughout tumor tissues and simultaneously sorted to lysosomes for cathepsin B&#8208;activated drug release. This study not only identifies OPPX as an exemplary nanomedicine but also underscores the feasibility of modulating subcellular distribution to optimize the active transport capabilities and intracellular release mechanisms of nanomedicines, providing an alternative approach to designing efficient anticancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Sequentially Processed Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction&#8208;Buried Structure for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with 500&#160;nm Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk&#8208;heterojunction is buried into layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structures to realize decent vertical phase distribution and sufficient exciton dissociation interfaces simultaneously. This scheme possesses efficient exciton dissociation and rapid charge transport, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 16.0% in organic solar cells with 500&#8208;nm&#8208;thick active layers.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area printing fabrication is a distinctive feature of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the advance of upscalable fabrication is challenged by the thickness of organic active layers considering the importance of both exciton dissociation and charge collection. In this work, a bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;buried (buried&#8208;BHJ) structure is introduced by sequential deposition to realize efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, thereby contributing to efficient OSCs with 500&#160;nm thick active layers. The buried&#8208;BHJ distributes donor and acceptor phases in the vertical direction as charge transport channels, while numerous BHJ interfaces are buried in each phase to facilitate exciton dissociation simultaneously. It is found that buried&#8208;BHJ configurations possess efficient exciton dissociation and rapid charge transport, resulting in reduced recombination losses. In comparison with traditional structures, the buried&#8208;BHJ structure displays a decent tolerance to film thickness. In particular, a power conversion efficiency of 16.0% is achieved with active layers at a thickness of 500&#160;nm. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this represents the champion efficiency of thick film OSCs.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalyst via Spin Manipulation for Efficient Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implanting Fe atomic clusters on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C matrix is achieved by a developed pyrolyzing method of double&#8208;ligand zinc&#8208;based zeolite framework. Spin&#8208;state of Fe single atoms verified from low spin (LS, t2g6 eg0) to medium spin (MS, t2g5 eg1) enables boosting the reaction kinetics of the rate&#8208;determining step, which finally leads to advanced oxygen reduction reaction activities and Zn&#8211;air batteries performance.








Abstract
The interaction between oxygen species and metal sites of various orbitals exhibits intimate correlation with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, a new approach for boosting the inherent ORR activity of atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C matrix is represented by implanting Fe&#160;atomic clusters nearby. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst delivers excellent ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.78 and 0.90&#160;V in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. The decent ORR activity can also be validated from the high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery. The experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron spin&#8208;state of monodispersed Fe active sites is transferred from the low spin (LS, t2g6 eg0) to the medium spin (MS, t2g5 eg1) due to the involvement of Fe atomic clusters, leading to the spin electron filling in &#963;&#8727; orbit, by which it favors OH&#8722; desorption and in turn boosts the reaction kinetics of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work paves a solid way for rational design of high&#8208;performance Fe&#8208;based single atom catalysts through spin manipulation.

         <title>Dendronized Polymer&#8208;Derived Nanomedicines for Mitochondrial Dynamics Regulation and Immune Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative dendronized polymer&#8208;derived nanomedicine for breast cancer treatment. Dendron(G2)&#8208;dendronized polymeric conjugate effectively targets tumors to release chemotherapeutic agents, and actively modulates mitochondrial dynamics. This modulation promotes mitochondrial fusion and enhances MHC&#8208;1 antigen presentation, which aids in the activation of cytotoxic T cells, providing a potent, synergistic approach with PD&#8208;1 inhibitor to effectively combat tumors.








Abstract
The effects of dendron side chains in polymeric conjugates on tumor penetration and antigen presentation are systematically examined. Three polymer&#8208;gemcitabine (Gem) conjugates (pG0&#8208;Gem, pG1&#8208;Gem, pG2&#8208;Gem) are designed and prepared. The pG2&#8208;Gem conjugate uniquely binds to the mitochondria of tumor cells, thus regulating mitochondrial dynamics. The interaction between the pG2&#8208;Gem conjugate and the mitochondria promotes great penetration and accumulation of the conjugate at the tumor site, resulting in pronounced antitumor effects in an animal model. Such encouraging therapeutic effects can be ascribed to immune modulation since MHC&#8208;1 antigen presentation is significantly enhanced due to mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial metabolism alteration after pG2&#8208;Gem treatment. Crucially, the drug&#8208;free dendronized polymer, pG2, is identified to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, and the regulation is independent of the conjugated Gem. Furthermore, the combination of pG2&#8208;Gem with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in a remarkable tumor clearance rate of 87.5% and a prolonged survival rate of over 150 days, demonstrating the potential of dendronized polymers as an innovative nanoplatform for metabolic modulation and synergistic tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Stable and Highly Active Single Atom Configurations for Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward approach to stabilize (and activate) platinum single atoms (Pt SAs) on TiO2 surfaces is shown. Through the optimization of post&#8208;deposition annealing treatments, few&#8208;atom Pt assemblies that are resistant to agglomeration are successfully formed and exhibited significantly enhanced hydrogen production efficiency.








Abstract
The employment of single atoms (SAs), especially Pt SAs, as co&#8208;catalysts in photocatalytic H2 generation has gained significant attention due to their exceptional efficiency. However, a major challenge in their application is the light&#8208;induced agglomeration of these SAs into less active nanosized particles under photocatalytic conditions. This study addresses the stability and reactivity of Pt SAs on TiO2 surfaces by investigating various post&#8208;deposition annealing treatments in air, Ar, and Ar&#8208;H2 environments at different temperatures. It is described that annealing in an Ar&#8208;H2 atmosphere optimally stabilizes SA configurations, forming stable 2D rafts of assembled SAs &#8776;0.5&#8211;1&#160;nm in diameter. These rafts not only resist light&#8208;induced agglomeration but also exhibit significantly enhanced H2 production efficiency. The findings reveal a promising approach to maintaining the high reactivity of Pt SAs while overcoming the critical challenge of their stability under photocatalytic conditions.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Mediated Strong Plasticization for High&#8208;Performance Alginate Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a facile processing method to fabricate natural polysaccharide plastics as convenient as a thermoforming process. Polysaccharide plastics are processed in a near&#8208;solid state by hydrogen bond mediation, realizing sufficient stretching that improves chain alignment. Highly orientated and crystalline alginate films exhibit high mechanical performance comparable to synthetic films. High&#8208;performance alginate plastics with desired functionalities are also constructed.








Abstract
The increasingly severe plastic pollution has urged an inevitable trend to develop biodegradable plastic products that can take over synthetic plastics. As one of the most abundant natural polymers, polysaccharides are an ideal candidate to substitute synthetic plastics. The rigidity of polysaccharide chains principally allows for high strength and stiffness of their materials, however, challenges the facile orientation in material processing. Here, a general hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated plasticization strategy to regulate isotropic sodium alginate (SA) chains to a highly ordered state is developed, and alginate plastics with high performances are fabricated. It is revealed that hydroxyl groups in glycerol modulate the viscoelasticity of SA solids by forming strong hydrogen bonds with SA chains, achieving a large stretchability at a high solid content. Highly orientated alginate films exhibit a superior tensile strength of 575&#160;MPa and toughness of 60.7&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, outperforming most regenerated biomass films. The high solid content and large stretchability mediated by strong hydrogen bonding ensure plastic molding of solid&#8208;like SA with high fidelity. This hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated plasticity provides a facile but effective method to justify the high performances of polysaccharide&#8208;based plastics.

         <title>The Potential Regulation of Working Anode for Long&#8208;Term Zero&#8208;Volt Storage at 37&#160;&#176;C in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term zero&#8208;volt storage (ZVS) in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at 37&#160;&#176;C is achieved through quantitative regulation of anode potential in working cells. This approach prevents Cu current collector dissolution and SEI degradation by controlling the Li6CoO4 content in cathode, with reversible capacity in slight over&#8208;lithiation LCO demonstrated.

The advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries that can tolerate zero&#8208;volt storage (ZVS) are in high demand for implantable medical devices and spacecraft. However, ZVS can raise the anode potential, leading to Cu current collector dissolution and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) degradation, especially at 37&#160;&#176;C. In this contribution, by quantitatively regulating the dosage of Li6CoO4 cathode additives, controllable potential of the working anode under abusive&#8208;discharge conditions is demonstrated. The addition of Li6CoO4 keeps zero&#8208;crossing potential (ZCP) and the potential of ZVS below 2.0 V (vs Li/Li+) for LiCoO2|mesocarbon microbead cells at 37&#160;&#176;C. The capacity retention ratio (CRR) increases from 69.1% and 35.9% to 98.6% and 90.8% after 10 and 20 days of ZVS, respectively. The Cu dissolution and SEI degradation are effectively suppressed, while the over&#8208;lithiated cathode exhibits high reversible capacity after ZVS. The limiting conditions of long&#8208;term ZVS are further explored and a corresponding guide map is designed. When quantitatively regulating ZCP and the potential in ZVS, Cu dissolution, SEI degradation, and irreversible conversion of the cathode constitute the limiting conditions. This contribution designs the most reasonable potential range for ZVS protection at 37&#160;&#176;C, and realizes the best CRR record through precise potential regulation for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;The long-term zero-volt storage (ZVS) in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) at 37&#160;&#176;C is achieved through quantitative regulation of anode potential in working cells. This approach prevents Cu current collector dissolution and SEI degradation by controlling the Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; content in cathode, with reversible capacity in slight over-lithiation LCO demonstrated. This paves the way for emerging applications in active implantable medical devices.

         <title>Photothermal Mineralization of Polyolefin Microplastics via TiO2 Hierarchical Porous Layer&#8208;Based Semiwetting Air&#8208;Plastic&#8208;Solid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase system based on a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) is established. It boosts the photoexcitation and transfer of charge carriers and the interfacial diffusion of gaseous oxygen, greatly improving low&#8208;density polyethylene photothermal mineralization relative to a conventional diphase system. Investigations into micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano level wettability at air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces help unravel the interfacial diffusion&#8208;reaction process.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;mineralization of microplastics under mild conditions has emerged as a promising solution to plastic waste disposal. However, the inadequate contact between oxygen, water&#8208;insoluble polyolefin microplastics, and photocatalysts remains a critical issue. In this study, a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) photocatalyst is presented to establish air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase interfaces for the photothermal mineralization of polyolefins. The wettability of the TiO2&#8208;HPL&#8208;based triphase interface is finely controlled from plastophobic to plastophilic. High&#8208;resolution imaging and finite element simulation demonstrate the significance of a semiwetting state in achieving multidirectional oxygen diffusion through the hierarchical pore structure while maintaining sufficient contact between the plastic phase and photocatalysts. For low&#8208;density polyethylene, the TiO2&#8208;HPL achieves a photothermal mineralization rate of 5.63 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a conversion of 26.3% after 20 h of continuous irradiation. Additionally, the triphase photocatalytic system with semiwetting gas&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces shows good universality for various polyolefin reagents and products, illustrating its potential in achieving efficient photothermal mineralization of non&#8208;degradable microplastics.

         <title>Designer Lithium Reservoirs for Ultralong Life Lithium Batteries for Grid Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by the unique mediation chemistry of elemental sulfur, the designer lithium reservoirs possess controllable electrochemical activities and high specific capacity without evolution of any reactive gases, which contribute to an outstanding cycling stability in a prototype pouch cell with an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level capacity.








Abstract
The minimization of irreversible active lithium loss stands as a pivotal concern in rechargeable lithium batteries, particularly in the context of grid&#8208;storage applications, where achieving the utmost energy density over prolonged cycling is imperative to meet stringent demands, notably in terms of life cost. Departing from conventional methodologies advocating electrode prelithiation and/or electrolyte additives, a new paradigm is proposed here: the integration of a designer lithium reservoir (DLR) featuring lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) and elemental sulfur. This approach concurrently addresses active lithium consumption through solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and mitigates minor yet continuous parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface during extended cycling. The remarkable synergy between the Li&#8208;ion conductive Li4SiO4 and the SEI&#8208;favorable elemental sulfur enables customizable compensation kinetics for active lithium loss throughout continuous cycling. The introduction of a minute quantity of DLR (3 wt% Li4SiO4@S) yields outstanding cycling stability in a prototype pouch cell (graphite||LiFePO4) with an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level capacity (&#8776;2.3 Ah), demonstrating remarkable capacity retention (&#8776;95%) even after 3000 cycles. This utilization of a DLR is poised to expedite the development of enduring lithium batteries for grid&#8208;storage applications and stimulate the design of practical, implantable rechargeable batteries based on related cell chemistries.

         <title>Exosome&#8208;Inhibiting Polymeric Sonosensitizer for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exosome&#8208;inhibiting polymeric sonosensitizer (EIPS) is designed for combination sono&#8208;immunotherapy, triggering tumor immunogenic cell death under ultrasound irradiation and inhibiting tumor exosome generation upon activation by tumor biomarker.








Abstract
Combination cancer immunotherapy based on electromagnetic energy and immunotherapy shows potent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy. However, as a factor that mediates tumor metastasis and immune suppression, the impact of tumor exosomes on therapy under electromagnetic energy stimulation remains unclear. Herein, findings indicate that sonodynamic therapy (SDT) increases serum exosome levels by inducing apoptotic exosomes and loosening the tumor extracellular matrix, promoting lung metastasis. To address this problem, an exosome&#8208;inhibiting polymeric sonosensitizer (EIPS) selectively inhibiting tumor exosome generation in response to the tumor biomarker is synthesized. EIPS consists of a semiconducting polymer backbone capable of inducing SDT and a poly(ethylene glycol) layer conjugated with a tumor&#8208;specific enzyme&#8208;responsive exosome inhibitor prodrug. After being cleaved by tumor Cathepsin B, EIPS releases active exosome inhibitors, preventing tumor exosome&#8208;mediated immune suppression and lung metastasis. As a result, EIPS elicits robust antitumor effects through the synergistic effect of SDT and tumor exosome inhibition, completely preventing lung metastasis and establishing a long&#8208;term immune memory effect. This is the first example showing that combining SDT with tumor&#8208;specific exosome inhibition can elicit a potent immune response without the help of typical immune agonists.

         <title>Electronic Spin Alignment within Homologous NiS2/NiSe2 Heterostructures to Promote Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS2/NiSe2 interphase promotes spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni3+ transformation from low to high spin, thereby generating additional unpaired electrons. This high electronic spin configuration promotes the electrocatalytic polysulfide redox reaction within Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
The catalytic activation of the Li&#8208;S reaction is fundamental to maximize the capacity and stability of Li&#8208;S batteries (LSBs). Current research on Li&#8208;S catalysts mainly focuses on optimizing the energy levels to promote adsorption and catalytic conversion, while frequently overlooking the electronic spin state influence on charge transfer and orbital interactions. Here, hollow NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (NiS2/NiSe2@NC) are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructure promotes the spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni3+ transformation from low to high spin. This high spin configuration raises the electronic energy level and activates the electronic state. This&#160;accelerates the charge transfer and optimizes the adsorption energy, lowering the reaction energy barrier of the polysulfides&#160;conversion. Benefiting from these characteristics, LSBs based on NiS2/NiSe2@NC/S cathodes exhibit high initial capacity (1458 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (572 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 at 5C), and stable cycling with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.025% per cycle at 1C during 500 cycles. Even at high sulfur loadings (6.2 mg&#183;cm&#8315;2), high initial capacities of 1173 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 (7.27 mAh&#183;cm&#8315;2) are measured at 0.1C, and 1058 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 is retained after 300 cycles.

     alt="Electronic Spin Alignment within Homologous NiS2/NiSe2 Heterostructures to Promote Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollow NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interphase promotes spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; transformation from low to high spin, thereby generating additional unpaired electrons. This high electronic spin configuration promotes the electrocatalytic polysulfide redox reaction within Li-S batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic activation of the Li-S reaction is fundamental to maximize the capacity and stability of Li-S batteries (LSBs). Current research on Li-S catalysts mainly focuses on optimizing the energy levels to promote adsorption and catalytic conversion, while frequently overlooking the electronic spin state influence on charge transfer and orbital interactions. Here, hollow NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@NC) are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure promotes the spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; transformation from low to high spin. This high spin configuration raises the electronic energy level and activates the electronic state. This&#160;accelerates the charge transfer and optimizes the adsorption energy, lowering the reaction energy barrier of the polysulfides&#160;conversion. Benefiting from these characteristics, LSBs based on NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@NC/S cathodes exhibit high initial capacity (1458 mAh&#183;g&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (572 mAh&#183;g&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5C), and stable cycling with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.025% per cycle at 1C during 500 cycles. Even at high sulfur loadings (6.2 mg&#183;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), high initial capacities of 1173 mAh&#183;g&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (7.27 mAh&#183;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are measured at 0.1C, and 1058 mAh&#183;g&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is retained after 300 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Design for Diverse Controllable Patterns in Self&#8208;Wrinkling Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy to constructing arbitrary on&#8208;demand self&#8208;wrinkle patterns on polyurethane elastomers via spatiotemporal photochemistry boundaries is developed. This technology allows for the attainment of a diverse array of controllable patterns, ranging from highly 2D ordered to periodic or intricate designs, providing a versatile basis for applications in anticounterfeiting devices, dynamic light grating, and functional systems.








Abstract
Harnessing the spontaneous surface instability of pliable substances to create intricate, well&#8208;ordered, and on&#8208;demand controlled surface patterns holds great potential for advancing applications in optical, electrical, and biological processes. However, the current limitations stem from challenges in modulating multidirectional stress fields and diverse boundary environments. Herein, this work proposes a universal strategy to achieve arbitrarily controllable wrinkle patterns via the spatiotemporal photochemical boundaries. Utilizing constraints and inductive effects of the photochemical boundaries, the multiple coupling relationship is accomplished among the light fields, stress fields, and morphology of wrinkles in photosensitive polyurethane (PSPU) film. Moreover, employing sequential light&#8208;irradiation with photomask enables the attainment of a diverse array of controllable patterns, ranging from highly ordered 2D patterns to periodic or intricate designs. The fundamental mechanics of underlying buckling and the formation of surface features are comprehensively elucidated through theoretical stimulation and finite element analysis. The results reveal the evolution laws of wrinkles under photochemical boundaries and represent a new effective toolkit for fabricating intricate and captivating patterns in single&#8208;layer films.

         <title>Dynamic Reversible Oxidation&#8208;Reduction of Iodide Ions for Operationally Stable Perovskite Solar Cells under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>

Mercaptoethylammonium iodide (ESAI) is incorporated into perovskite as an additive to inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, which provides a dynamic mechanism for the continuous reduction of I2 under light and thermal stresses, facilitating the healing of iodine&#8208;induced degradations. Under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions, the device with ESAI retained 97% of the original power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 300 h.








Abstract
Despite rapid advancements in the photovoltaic efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their operational stability remains a significant challenge for commercialization. This instability mainly arises from light&#8208;induced halide ion migration and subsequent oxidation into iodine (I2). The situation is exacerbated when considering the heat effects at elevated temperatures, leading to the volatilization of I2 and resulting in irreversible device degradation. Mercaptoethylammonium iodide (ESAI) is thus incorporated into perovskite as an additive to inhibit the oxidation of iodide anion (I&#8722;) and &#160;the light&#8208;induced degradation pathway of FAPbI3&#8594;FAI+PbI2. Additionally, the formation of a thiol&#8208;disulfide/I&#8722;&#8208;I2 redox pair within the perovskite film provides a dynamic mechanism for the continuous reduction of I2 under light and thermal stresses, facilitating the healing of iodine&#8208;induced degradations. This approach significantly enhances the operational stability of PSCs. Under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 testing protocol (maximum power point (MPP) tracking in an environment with relative humidity of &#8776;50% at &#8776;65&#160;&#176;C), the treated PSCs maintain 97% of their original power conversion efficieney (PCE) after 300 h of aging. In contrast, control devices exhibit almost complete degradation, primarily due to rapid thermal&#8208;induced I2 volatilization. These results demonstrate a promising strategy to overcome critical stability challenges in PSCs, particularly in scenarios involving thermal effects.

         <title>Tunnel&#8208;Oriented VO2 (B) Cathode for High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directional ion diffusion in the VO2 (B) cathode is achieved by manipulating exposed crystal facet and morphology. The dispersive (00l) facets&#8208;dominated VO2 (B) nanobelts tend to spread flatly to form directional and fast ion transport alone the tunnels in the c&#8208;axis. Such a feature ensures the ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance, surpassing that of aggregated samples with random arrangement.








Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;type vanadium oxides are promising cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, unlike layer&#8208;type cathodes with adjustable layer distances, enhancing ion&#8208;transport kinetics in tunnels characterized by fixed sizes poses a considerable challenge. This study highlights that the macroscopic arrangement of the electrode crucially determines tunnel orientation, thereby influencing ion transport. By changing the material morphology, the tunnel orientation can be optimized to facilitate rapid ion diffusion. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, it is revealed that (00l) facets&#8208;dominated VO2 (B) nanobelts with dispersive morphology (VO2&#8208;D) tend to adopt a stacking pattern with directional ion transport along the c&#8208;axis on the electrode and guarantee fast ion diffusion. Compared with the aggregated sample (VO2&#8208;A) that tends to random arrangement on the electrode with isotropic and slow ion transfer behavior, the electrode featuring dispersive (00l) facets&#8208;dominated VO2 (B) nanobelts displays directional and fast ion diffusion behavior, thus exhibits an ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance (420.8 and 344.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 10 A g&#8722;1, respectively) and long cycling stability (84.3% capacity retention under 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). The results suggest that simultaneous manipulation of exposed crystal facet and morphology&#8208;related electrode arrangement should be promising for boosting the ion&#8208;transport kinetics in tunnel&#8208;type vanadium oxide cathodes.

         <title>Optically Tunable Electrical Oscillations in Oxide&#8208;Based Memristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports light&#8208;control of an oxide&#8208;based relaxation oscillator based on the photothermal response of V3O5, a material that undergoes an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition at temperatures above &#8776;420 K.&#160; The research advances the understanding of V3O5 as a functional material, and demonstrates its potential as the basis of a solid&#8208;state sensory neuron for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The application of hardware&#8208;based neural networks can be enhanced by integrating sensory neurons and synapses that enable direct input from external stimuli. This work reports direct optical control of an oscillatory neuron based on volatile threshold switching in V3O5.

Using temperature&#8208;dependent electrical measurements, conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), in situ thermal imaging, and lumped element modelling, it is shown that the changes in switching parameters, including threshold and hold voltages, arise from overall conductivity increase of the oxide film due to the contribution of both photoconductive and bolometric characteristics of V3O5, which eventually affects the oscillation dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;This study reports light-control of an oxide-based relaxation oscillator based on the photothermal response of V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, a material that undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition at temperatures above &#8776;420 K.&#160; The research advances the understanding of V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; as a functional material, and demonstrates its potential as the basis of a solid-state sensory neuron for neuromorphic computing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of hardware-based neural networks can be enhanced by integrating sensory neurons and synapses that enable direct input from external stimuli. This work reports direct optical control of an oscillatory neuron based on volatile threshold switching in V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The devices exhibit electroforming-free operation with switching parameters that can be tuned by optical illumination. Using temperature-dependent electrical measurements, conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM), in situ thermal imaging, and lumped element modelling, it is shown that the changes in switching parameters, including threshold and hold voltages, arise from overall conductivity increase of the oxide film due to the contribution of both photoconductive and bolometric characteristics of V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which eventually affects the oscillation dynamics.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale, Stretchable, Self&#8208;Protective, and Multifunctional Perovskite Luminescent Filament with Ultra&#8208;High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite luminescent filament (PLF) with high stretchability, large scalability, and high luminescence is obtained by wet spinning via a fast solvent extraction. The CsPbBr3 PLF displayed prominent stability in air, water, moisture, heat, etc. The CsPbX3 PLF demonstrates significant potential in organic dyes and strain sensing, flexible displays, secondary anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and hazard warning systems.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites possess great application potential in flexible displays and wearable optoelectronics owing to their prominent optoelectronic properties. However, the intrinsic instability upon moisture, heat, and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation hinders their development and application. In this work, an ultra&#8208;stable CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite luminescent filament (PLF) with high stretchability (&#8776;2400%) and luminescence performance (photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24.5%, tunable emission spectrum, and high color purity) is introduced by a facile environmental&#8208;friendly wet&#8208;spinning technology via solvent extraction. Benefiting from the in situ encapsulation of the hydrophobic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and the chelation of Lewis base CO in TPU with Lewis acid Pb2+, the CsPbBr3 PLF demonstrates ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence (PL) stability when stored in ambient air and high humidity circumstance, annealed at 50 &#176;C, and dipped in water for 30 days, illuminated under ultraviolet light for 300 min, and immersed in organic solvents and solutions with pH of 1&#8208;13 for 5 min, respectively. Impressively, it retains 80% of its initial PL after being recycled five times. Overall, the CsPbX3 PLF demonstrates promising prospects in multifunctional applications, including organic dyes and tensile strain sensing, flexible pattern displays, secondary anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and hazard warning systems.

         <title>Observing Proton&#8211;Electron Mixed Conductivity in Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that conjugated diynes and oxygenic functional groups tune the proton&#8211;electron conductivity in graphdiyne. In addition, a wet&#8208;chemistry lithography technique for uniform preparation of graphdiyne on flexible substrates is provided. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a breath&#8211;machine interface for sentence&#8208;based communication and self&#8208;nursing tasks with an accuracy of 98% is designed.








Abstract
Mixed conducting materials with both ionic and electronic conductivities have gained prominence in emerging applications. However, exploring material with on&#8208;demand ionic and electronic conductivities remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of correlating macroscopic conductivity with atom&#8208;scale structure. Here, the correlation of proton&#8211;electron conductivity and atom&#8208;scale structure in graphdiyne is explored. Precisely adjusting the conjugated diynes and oxygenic functional groups in graphdiyne yields a tunable proton&#8211;electron conductivity on the order of 103. In addition, a wet&#8208;chemistry lithography technique for uniform preparation of graphdiyne on flexible substrates is provided. Utilizing the proton&#8211;electron conductivity and mechanical tolerance of graphdiyne, bimodal flexible devices serving as capacitive switches and resistive sensors are created. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a breath&#8211;machine interface for sentence&#8208;based communication and self&#8208;nursing tasks with an accuracy of 98% is designed. This work represents an important step toward understanding the atom&#8208;scale structure&#8211;conductivity relationship and extending the applications of mixed conducting materials to assistive technology.

         <title>Memristive Explainable Artificial Intelligence Hardware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A memristive explainable artificial intelligence (MemXAI) hardware is proposed to provide an explanation and interpretation of AI decisions, where the three essential functions are implemented using three different types of memristors. The MemXAI hardware promotes a trustworthy AI system with low energy consumption of only 4.32% compared to conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;based computing systems.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is often considered a black box because it provides optimal answers without clear insight into its decision&#8208;making process. To address this black box problem, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged, which provides an explanation and interpretation of its decisions, thereby promoting the trustworthiness of AI systems. Here, a memristive XAI hardware framework is presented. This framework incorporates three distinct types of memristors (Mott memristor, valence change memristor, and charge trap memristor), each responsible for performing three essential functions (perturbation, analog multiplication, and integration) required for the XAI hardware implementation. Three memristor arrays with high robustness are fabricated and the image recognition of 3 &#215; 3 testing patterns and their explanation map generation are experimentally demonstrated. Then, a software&#8208;based extended system based on the characteristics of this hardware is built, simulating a large&#8208;scale image recognition task. The proposed system can perform the XAI operations with only 4.32% of the energy compared to conventional digital systems, enlightening its strong potential for the XAI accelerator.

         <title>Bipolaronic Motifs Induced Spatially Separated Catalytic Sites for Tunable Syngas Photosynthesis From CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolaronic Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs and Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs are custom&#8208;designed into an imine&#8208;linked triazine covalent organic framework, resulting in an efficient reaction decoupling of CO2 reduction and water splitting. Such featured structures show efficient photocatalytic performance toward CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion with a suitable CO/H2 ratio (1:1&#8722;1:3) and can achieve a high syngas evolution rate of 15.8 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into syngas is a promising way to tackle the energy and environmental challenges; however, it remains a challenge to achieve reaction decoupling of CO2 reduction and water splitting. Therefore, efficient production of syngas with a suitable CO/H2 ratio for Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis can hardly be achieved. Herein, bipolaronic motifs including Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs and Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs are rationally designed into a crystalline imine&#8208;linked 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione&#8208;based covalent organic framework (bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF) with a triazine core. These featured structures with spatially separated active sites exhibit efficient photocatalytic performance toward CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion with a suitable CO/H2 ratio (1:1&#8722;1:3). The bipolaronic motifs enable a highly separated electron&#8211;hole state, whereby the Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs tend to be the active sites for CO2 activation and accelerate the hydrogenation to form *COOH intermediates; whilst, the Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs increase surface hydrophilicity for H2 evolution. The photocatalytic reductions of CO2 and H2O thus decouple and proceed via a concerted way on the bipolaronic motifs of bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF. The optimal bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF photocatalyst achieves a high syngas evolution rate of 15.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with CO/H2 ratio of 1:2, outperforming previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

Such featured structures show efficient photocatalytic performance toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-syngas conversion with a suitable CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio (1:1&#8722;1:3) and can achieve a high syngas evolution rate of 15.8 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into syngas is a promising way to tackle the energy and environmental challenges; however, it remains a challenge to achieve reaction decoupling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and water splitting. Therefore, efficient production of syngas with a suitable CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio for Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis can hardly be achieved. Herein, bipolaronic motifs including Co(II)-pyridine N motifs and Co(II)-imine N motifs are rationally designed into a crystalline imine-linked 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione-based covalent organic framework (bp-Co-COF) with a triazine core. These featured structures with spatially separated active sites exhibit efficient photocatalytic performance toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-syngas conversion with a suitable CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio (1:1&#8722;1:3). The bipolaronic motifs enable a highly separated electron&#8211;hole state, whereby the Co(II)-pyridine N motifs tend to be the active sites for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and accelerate the hydrogenation to form *COOH intermediates; whilst, the Co(II)-imine N motifs increase surface hydrophilicity for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. The photocatalytic reductions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O thus decouple and proceed via a concerted way on the bipolaronic motifs of bp-Co-COF. The optimal bp-Co-COF photocatalyst achieves a high syngas evolution rate of 15.8&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 1:2, outperforming previously reported COF-based photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Triggered CO&#8208;Release from Gold Nanocluster: All&#8208;in&#8208;One Nanoplatforms for Cancer Targeted Gas and Radio Synergistic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An X&#8208;ray responsive CO&#8208;releasing nanoparticle (HA@AuNC@CO) based on strong host&#8211;guest interaction between cyclodextrin protected&#8208;gold nanocluster and adamantane modified CO donor is developed for the combination of gas therapy and radio therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that HA@AuNC@CO exhibits active targeting toward CD44 overexpressed cancer cells and excellent inhibition of glycolysis for efficient radiotherapy against cancer.








Abstract
Glycolysis&#8208;dominant metabolic pathway in cancer cells can promote their therapeutic resistance against radiotherapy (RT). Carbon monoxide (CO) as a glycolysis inhibitor can enhance the efficiency of RT. Herein, an X&#8208;ray responsive CO&#8208;releasing nanocomposite (HA@AuNC@CO) based on strong host&#8211;guest interactions between the radiosensitizer and CO donor for enhanced RT is developed. The encapsulated gold nanoclusters (CD&#8208;AuNCs) can effectively generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X&#8208;ray radiation, which not only directly inactivate cancer cells but also induce in situ CO gas generation from adamantane modified metal carbonyl (Ada&#8208;CO) for glycolysis inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that HA@AuNC@CO exhibits active targeting toward CD44 overexpressed cancer cells, along with excellent inhibition of glycolysis and efficient RT against cancer. This study offers a new strategy for the combination of gas therapy and RT in tumor treatment.

         <title>Atomic Pt Sites Anchored in the Interface between Grains on Vacancy&#8208;Enriched CeO2 Nanosheets: One&#8208;Step Precursor Combustion Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step precursor combustion strategy for developing atomic Pt catalysts is proposed, which results in the atomic Pt sites anchored in the interface between grains on vacancy&#8208;enriched CeO2 nanosheets. Thereinto, the atomic Pt sites with the low valence state in the CeO2 interface can improve the low&#8208;temperature activity for a three&#8208;way catalyst.








Abstract
Atomic metal catalysts have unique electronic, structural, and catalytic properties, which are widely used in the field of catalysis. However, designing new simple synthesis methods to fabricate atomic metal catalysts is a challenge in catalytic applications. Herein, a one&#8208;step precursor combustion strategy is presented that starts directly from precursors of metal salts, using a spontaneous combustion process convert platinum nitrate to atomic Pt sites. The atomic Pt sites with low valence are anchored in the formed interface between grains on vacancy&#8208;enriched CeO2 nanosheets. The obtained Pt/CeO2&#8208;2 catalyst exhibits much higher three&#8208;way catalytic activities at low temperatures than Pt/CeO2&#8208;C catalysts prepared using the traditional impregnation method. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated lower valent Pt atoms in the CeO2 interface promote catalytic activity through reducing the energy barrier, and lead to an overall improvement of three&#8208;way catalytic activities. This facile strategy provides new insights into the study of the properties and applications of atomic noble metal catalysts.

The polymer optical fiber based on the temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence of NaLaTi2O6:Yb/Er phosphors is inserted into a pouch&#8208;type battery, and the continuous temperature variations are instantly obtained to deduce the immediate internal circumstances.&#160;The real&#8208;time and in situ thermal evolution inside the battery can be stably transmitted by the optical fiber without hindering the normal operation. 








Abstract
Thermal characteristics are essential for improving the performance and monitoring the status of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, it is a challenge to design efficient and facile sensing materials for the detection of the in situ temperature of a working LIB. Herein, a ratiometric fluorescence optical fiber is developed and real&#8208;time temperature monitoring is performed with a measurement accuracy of 0.12&#160;&#176;C, and the feasibility based on this polymer optical fiber composed of NaLaTi2O6:Yb/Er phosphors is verified in a pouch&#8208;type battery. During the charging and discharging cycles, the in situ temperature is instantaneously conveyed, revealing the internal situation of LIBs. This article further dwells on the thermal characteristics in constant current (CC)/constant voltage charging and CC discharging processes at different C&#8208;rates and the battery failure when operated at low temperatures (0&#160;&#176;C). This work demonstrates an innovative strategy for operando solitary temperature monitoring conducted by ratiometric fluorescence optical fiber.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Inspired All&#8208;Natural Biogel for Bioadhesive Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, inspired by the role of natural moisturizing factor in the skin, a straightforward yet versatile approach for fabricating highly ductile, ionically conductive, long&#8208;term stable, and fully degradable all&#8208;natural gelatin&#8208;based biogel is presented. The developed biogel holds promise for constructing reliable bio&#8208;interfaces for electrophysiological signal recording, offering high signal fidelity and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Natural material&#8208;based hydrogels are considered ideal candidates for constructing robust bio&#8208;interfaces due to their environmentally sustainable nature and biocompatibility. However, these hydrogels often encounter limitations such as weak mechanical strength, low water resistance, and poor ionic conductivity. Here, inspired by the role of natural moisturizing factor (NMF) in skin, a straightforward yet versatile strategy is proposed for fabricating all&#8208;natural ionic biogels that exhibit high resilience, ionic conductivity, resistance to dehydration, and complete degradability, without necessitating any chemical modification. A well&#8208;balanced combination of gelatin and sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (an NMF compound) gives rise to a significant enhancement in the mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capacity of the biogel compared to pure gelatin hydrogel. The biogel manifests temperature&#8208;controlled reversible fluid&#8208;gel transition properties attributed to the triple&#8208;helix junctions of gelatin, which enables in situ gelation on diverse substrates, thereby ensuring conformal contact and dynamic compliance with curved surfaces. Due to its salutary properties, the biogel can serve as an effective and biocompatible interface for high&#8208;quality and long&#8208;term electrophysiological signal recording. These findings provide a general and scalable approach for designing natural material&#8208;based hydrogels with tailored functionalities to meet diverse application needs.

A bifunctional solar evaporator is developed by designing polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;functionalized photothermal sponge. This evaporator not only exhibits a water evaporation rate of 3.53 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and 98.6% solar energy conversion efficiency but also can uninterruptedly deliver a voltage output of 0.972&#160;V and a current density of 172.38 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 in brine over a prolonged period under one sun.








Abstract
Technologies that can simultaneously generate electricity and desalinate seawater are highly attractive and required to meet the increasing global demand for power and clean water. Here, a bifunctional solar evaporator that features continuous electric generation in seawater without salt accumulation is developed by rational design of polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;functionalized photothermal sponge. This evaporator not only exhibits an unprecedentedly high water evaporation rate of 3.53 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1along with 98.6% solar energy conversion efficiency but can also uninterruptedly deliver a voltage output of 0.972&#160;V and a current density of 172.38 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 in high&#8208;concentration brine over a prolonged period under one sun irradiation. Many common electronic devices can be driven by simply connecting evaporator units in series or in parallel without any other auxiliaries. Different from the previously proposed power generation mechanism, this study reveals that the water&#8208;enabled proton concentration fields in intermediate water region can also induce an additional ion electric field in free water region containing solute, to further enhance electricity output. Given the low&#8208;cost materials, simple self&#8208;regeneration design, scalable fabrication processes, and stable performance, this work offers a promising strategy for addressing the shortages of clean water and sustainable electricity.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Co&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate to Urea with High Faradaic Efficiency on Cobalt&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>

         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) act as a highselective electrocatalyst for urea production by C&#8211;N coupling, offering a large urea yield of 2217.5 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and a remarkably high Faradaic efficiency of 54.3%. The rationally constructed point&#8208;to&#8208;face architecture favors exposure of more active sites, sufficient catalyst&#8208;electrolyte contact, and fast reactant/product diffusion.








Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered nitrate/carbon dioxide co&#8208;reduction reaction toward urea production paves an attractive alternative to industrial urea processes and offers a clean on&#8208;site approach to closing the global nitrogen cycle. However, its large&#8208;scale implantation is severely impeded by challenging C&#8211;N coupling and requires electrocatalysts with high activity/selectivity. Here, cobalt&#8208;nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) are proposed as a catalyst electrode to boost yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward urea electrosynthesis with enhanced C&#8211;N coupling. Such Co NPs@C renders superb urea&#8208;producing activity with a high FE reaching 54.3% and a urea yield of 2217.5 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1, much superior to the Co NPs and C nanosheet counterparts, and meanwhile shows strong stability. The Co NPs@C affords rich catalytically active sites, fast reactant diffusion, and sufficient catalytic surfaces&#8208;electrolyte contacts with favored charge and ion transfer efficiencies. The theoretical calculations reveal that the high&#8208;rate formation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates is crucial for facilitating urea synthesis.

         <title>Stabilizing Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Liquid Metal Via Dynamic Hydrogel&#8208;Derived Carbon Framework Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to encapsulate EGaIn within a hierarchically porous carbon network derived from a hydrogel matrix, which not only buffers the volume change and promotes the reaction kinetics but also reduces the side&#8208;reactions caused by the spontaneous oxidation of LM and decomposition of the SEI, is developed.








Abstract
Eutectic gallium&#8211;indium liquid metal (EGaIn&#8208;LM), with a considerable capacity and unique self&#8208;healing properties derived from its intrinsic liquid nature, gains tremendous attention for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) anode. However, the fluidity of the LM can trigger continuous consumption of the electrolyte, and its liquid&#8211;solid transition during the lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation process may result in the rupture of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, LM is employed as an initiator to in situ assemble the 3D hydrogel for dynamically encapsulating itself; the LM nanoparticles can be homogeneously confined within the hydrogel&#8208;derived carbon framework (HDC) after calcination. Such design effectively alleviates the volume expansion of LM and facilitates electron transportation, resulting in a superior rate capability and long&#8208;term cyclability. Further, the &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; SEI structure and its key components, including the robust LiF outer layer and corrosion&#8208;resistant and ionic conductive LiGaOx inner layer are revealed, confirming the involvement of LM in the formation of SEI, as well as the important role of carbon framework in reducing interfacial side reactions and SEI decomposition. This work provides a distinct perspective for the formation, structural evolution, and composition of SEI at the liquid/solid interface, and demonstrates an effective strategy to construct a reliable matrix for stabilizing the SEI.

         <title>Dendritic Polymer&#8208;Based Nanomedicines Remodel the Tumor Stroma: Improve Drug Penetration and Enhance Antitumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic polymer&#8208;based nanomedicines are constructed for sequential delivery of dasatinib (DAS) and epirubicin (Epi). DAS&#8208;containing nanomedicine&#160;regulates collagen anabolism and energy metabolism of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) for extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation, thus facilitating the deep penetration of Epi&#8208;containing nanomedicine to potentiate immunogenic cell death. This sequential treatment strategy evokes robust antitumor immune responses to suppress breast cancer progression and metastasis.








Abstract
The dense extracellular matrix (ECM)&#160;in&#160;solid&#160;tumors, contributed by cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs), hinders penetration of drugs and diminishes their therapeutic outcomes. A sequential treatment strategy of remodeling the ECM via a CAF modifier (dasatinib, DAS) is proposed to promote penetration of an immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer (epirubicin, Epi) via apoptotic vesicles, ultimately enhancing the treatment efficacy against breast cancer. Dendritic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMA)&#8208;based nanomedicines (poly[OEGMA&#8208;Dendron(G2)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;Gly&#8208;DAS] (P&#8208;DAS) and poly[OEGMA&#8208;Dendron(G2)&#8208;hydrazone&#8208;Epi] (P&#8208;Epi)) are developed for sequential delivery of DAS and Epi, respectively. P&#8208;DAS reprograms CAFs to reduce collagen by downregulating collagen anabolism and energy metabolism, thereby reducing the ECM deposition. The regulated ECM can enhance tumor penetration of P&#8208;Epi to strengthen its ICD effect, leading to an amplified antitumor immune response. In breast cancer&#8208;bearing mice, this approach alleviates the ECM barrier, resulting in reduced tumor burden and increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, and more encouragingly, synergizes effectively with anti&#8208;programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1) therapy, significantly inhibiting tumor growth and preventing lung metastasis. Furthermore, systemic toxicity is barely detectable after sequential treatment with P&#8208;DAS and P&#8208;Epi. This approach opens a new avenue for treating desmoplastic tumors by metabolically targeting CAFs to overcome the ECM barrier.

         <title>2D Air&#8208;Stable Nonlayered Ferrimagnetic FeCr2S4 Crystals Synthesized via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful synthesis of highly crystalline 2D FeCr2S4 in 2D form with pure cubic spinel structure, which exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, thickness independent of TC and excellent air stability. The work promotes further exploration of the fundamental aspects of 2D magnets, and paves the way for the application of the 2D robust ferrimagnetic material in multiferroic and spintronic devices.








Abstract
The discovery of intrinsic 2D magnetic materials has opened up new opportunities for exploring magnetic properties at atomic layer thicknesses, presenting potential applications in spintronic devices. Here a new 2D ferrimagnetic crystal of nonlayered FeCr2S4 is synthesized with high phase purity using chemical vapor deposition. The obtained 2D FeCr2S4 exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, as evidenced by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane/in&#8208;plane Hall effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance. Theoretical calculations further elucidate that the observed magnetic anisotropy can be attributed to its surface termination structure. By combining temperature&#8208;dependent magneto&#8208;transport and polarized Raman spectroscopy characterizations, it is discovered that both the measured Curie temperature and the critical temperature at which a low energy magnon peak disappeared remains constant, regardless of its thickness. Magnetic force microscopy measurements show the flipping process of magnetic domains. The exceptional air&#8208;stability of the 2D FeCr2S4 is also confirmed via Raman spectroscopy and Hall hysteresis loops. The robust anisotropic ferrimagnetism, the thickness&#8208;independent of Curie temperature, coupled with excellent air&#8208;stability, make 2D FeCr2S4 crystals highly attractive for future spintronic devices.

         <title>Ordered Perovskite Structure with Functional Units for High Performance and Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite films based on the concept of ordered structures with functional units (OSFU) are constructed. With this structure, the ion migration within the active layer is successfully suppressed. Solar cells show negligible hysteresis and improved stability, including continuous operational and light/dark cycling tests.








Abstract
Ion migration is one of the most critical challenges that affects the stability of metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current arsenal of available strategies for solving this issue is limited. Here, novel perovskite active layers following the concept of ordered structures with functional units (OSFU) to intrinsically suppress ion migration, in which a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite layer is deposited by vapor deposition for light absorption and a 2D layer is deposited by solution process for ion inhibition, are constructed. As a promising result, the activation energy of ion migration increases from 0.36 eV for the conventional perovskite to 0.54 eV for the OSFU perovskite. These devices exhibit substantially enhanced operational stability in comparison with the conventional ones, retaining &gt;85% of their initial efficiencies after 1200&#8201;h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1. Moreover, the OSFU devices show negligible fatigue behavior with a robust performance under light/dark cycling aging test (ISOS&#8208;LC&#8208;1 protocol), which demonstrates the promising application of functional motif theory in this field.

         <title>A Viscous&#8208;Biofluid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing to Accelerate Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing (SPD) with aligned hydrated hydrogel channels based on a 3D&#8208;WET polymerization process is designed. The SPD exhibits a rapid water drainage speed and efficient draining of viscous fluids. In a diabetic rat model, the SPD shortens inflammation phase, promotes re&#8208;epithelialization, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition, thereby accelerating diabetic wound healing.








Abstract
Viscous biofluids on wounds challenge conventional &#8220;water&#8208;absorbing&#8221; wound dressings in efficient drainage due to their poor fluidity, generally causing prolonged inflammation, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and delayed wound closure. Herein, it is reported that a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing (SPD) with aligned hydrated hydrogel channels, prepared by a three&#8208;dimensional&#8208;templated wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (3D&#8208;WET) polymerization process, can efficiently drain viscous fluids and accelerate diabetic wound healing. The asymmetric wettability of the hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic layers and aligned hydrated hydrogel channels enable unidirectional and efficient drainage of viscous fluids away from the wounds, preventing their overhydration and inflammatory stimulation. The organogel layer can adhere onto the skin around the wounds but can be easily detached from the wet wound area, avoiding secondary trauma to the newly formed tissues. Taking a diabetic rat model as an example, the SPD can significantly downregulate the inflammation response by &#8776;70.8%, enhance the dermal remodeling by &#8776;14.3%, and shorten wound closure time by about 1/3 compared with the commercial dressing (3M, Tegaderm hydrocolloid thin dressing). This study sheds light on the development of the next generation of functional dressings for chronic wounds involving viscous biofluids.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Like Semiconductive Fillers for Dielectric Enhancement and Loss Reduction of Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of chain&#8208;like nanofibers (TiO2 and TINO) are synthesized by electrospinning for the dielectric composites. The intrinsic high&#8208;temperature loss tangent is effectively reduced by the atomic layer deposition&#8208;coated alumina shells on the nanofibers, which blocks carrier movement across the interfaces. The transformed crystalline porous alumina can further reduce dielectric loss by isolating the polymer from the nanofibers.








Abstract
Dielectric loss is a crucial factor in determining the long&#8208;term endurance for security and energy loss of dielectric composites. Here, chain&#8208;like semiconductive fibers of titanium oxide, indium, and niobium&#8208;doped titanium oxide are used for enhancing the complex dielectric properties of a polymer through composite construction, which involves significant interface enhancements. The chain&#8208;like fibers significantly enhance the dielectric constant owing to the special morphology of the fillers and their interfacial polarization, especially at higher temperatures. The dielectric loss and electrical conductivity of the composites are substantially reduced across the entire investigated temperature range, achieved by passivating the fiber surface with an alumina shell using atomic layer deposition. The as&#8208;deposited alumina shell transformed from an amorphous to a crystalline phase through thermal annealing results in a porous shell and more effective suppression of the loss tangent and electrical conductivity. A plausible mechanism for loss suppression is associated with carrier movement along the surface of the fibers and bulk, leading to a higher loss tangent. The alumina shell blocks the carrier transport path, particularly at the interfaces, resulting in a reduced interfacial polarization contribution and energy storage loss. This study provides a method for inhibiting dielectric loss by fabricating fillers with special surfaces.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Chemical&#8208;Gated Hydrogel Actuation Systems for Information 3D&#8208;Encoding Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By replicating the chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function of cephalopods&#8217; skin muscles for on&#8208;demand color/pattern display, a supramolecular host&#8211;guest interaction gating strategy is proposed to dynamically program and gate the thermoresponsiveness of smart hydrogel actuators after material manufacture, followed by the demonstration of robust chemical&#8208;gated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) encoding information carriers with enhanced display security.








Abstract
Cephalopods evolve the acetylcholine&#8208;gated actuation control function of their skin muscles, which enables their dynamic/static multimode display capacities for achieving perfectly spatial control over the colors/patterns on every inch of skin. Reproduction of artificial analogs that exhibit similar multimodal display is essential to reach advanced information three&#8208;dimensional (3D) encoding with higher security than the classic 2D&#8208;encoding strategy, but remains underdeveloped. The core difficulty is how to replicate such chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function into artificial soft actuating systems. Herein, this work proposes to develop azobenzene&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) hydrogel systems, whose upper critical solution temperature (UCST) type actuation responsiveness can be intelligently programmed or even gated by the addition of hydrophilic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) molecules for reversible association with pendant azobenzene moieties via supramolecular host&#8211;guest interactions. By employing such &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;gated hydrogel actuator as an analogue of cephalopods&#8217; skin muscle, biomimetic mechanically modulated multicolor fluorescent display systems are designed, which demonstrate a conceptually new &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;gated &#8220;thermal stimulation&#8208;hydrogel actuation&#8208;fluorescence output&#8221; display mechanism. Consequently, high&#8208;security 3D&#8208;encoding information carriers with an unprecedented combination of single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output, dynamic/static dual&#8208;mode and spatially controlled display capacities are achieved. This bioinspired strategy brings functional&#8208;integrated features for artificial display systems and opens previously unidentified avenues for information security.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalopods evolve the acetylcholine-gated actuation control function of their skin muscles, which enables their dynamic/static multimode display capacities for achieving perfectly spatial control over the colors/patterns on every inch of skin. Reproduction of artificial analogs that exhibit similar multimodal display is essential to reach advanced information three-dimensional (3D) encoding with higher security than the classic 2D-encoding strategy, but remains underdeveloped. The core difficulty is how to replicate such chemical-gated actuation control function into artificial soft actuating systems. Herein, this work proposes to develop azobenzene-functionalized poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) hydrogel systems, whose upper critical solution temperature (UCST) type actuation responsiveness can be intelligently programmed or even gated by the addition of hydrophilic &#945;-cyclodextrin (&#945;-CD) molecules for reversible association with pendant azobenzene moieties via supramolecular host&#8211;guest interactions. By employing such &#945;-CD-gated hydrogel actuator as an analogue of cephalopods&#8217; skin muscle, biomimetic mechanically modulated multicolor fluorescent display systems are designed, which demonstrate a conceptually new &#945;-CD-gated &#8220;thermal stimulation-hydrogel actuation-fluorescence output&#8221; display mechanism. Consequently, high-security 3D-encoding information carriers with an unprecedented combination of single-input multiple-output, dynamic/static dual-mode and spatially controlled display capacities are achieved. This bioinspired strategy brings functional-integrated features for artificial display systems and opens previously unidentified avenues for information security.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The biocompatible bottlebrush polymer (BB) can rapidly adhere to various substrates, offering exceptional antifouling and lubricant properties. It holds promise for treating diseases linked to bio&#8208;lubricant systems and optimizing the performance of medical devices, including contact lenses.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers (BB) have emerged as compelling candidates for biosystems to face tribological challenges, including friction and wear. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of an engineered triblock BB polymer's affinity, cell toxicity, lubrication, and wear protection in both in vitro and in vivo settings, focusing on applications for conditions like osteoarthritis and dry eye syndrome. Results show that the designed polymer rapidly adheres to various surfaces (e.g., cartilage, eye, and contact lens), forming a robust, biocompatible layer for surface lubrication and protection. The tribological performance and biocompatibility are further enhanced in the presence of hyaluronic acid (HA) both in vitro and in vivo. The exceptional lubrication performance and favorable interaction with HA position the synthesized triblock polymer as a promising candidate for innovative treatments addressing deficiencies in bio&#8208;lubricant systems.

         <title>Breaking Fundamental Limitation of Flow&#8208;Induced Anisotropic Growth for Large&#8208;Scale and Fast Printing of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental limitation of flow&#8208;induced anisotropy during the growth of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) is effectively overcome by a surfactant&#8208;additive printing method, which enables the deposition of uniform OSCFs. Fabricated 10 &#215; 10 flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor array&#8208;based on the OSCFs exhibit substantial improvements in average mobility up to 10.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, reaching a high value among flexible organic devices.








Abstract
Advanced organic electronic technologies have put forward a pressing demand for cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs). However, solution&#8208;printed OSCFs are typically plagued by the existence of abundant structural defects, which pose a formidable challenge to achieving large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;performance organic electronics. Here, it is elucidated that these structural defects are mainly originated from printing flow&#8208;induced anisotropic growth, an important factor that is overlooked for too long. In light of this, a surfactant&#8208;additive printing method is proposed to effectively overcome the anisotropic growth, enabling the deposition of uniform OSCFs over the wafer scale at a high speed of 1.2 mm s&#8722;1 at room temperature. The resulting OSCF exhibits appealing performance with a high average mobility up to 10.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values for flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor arrays. Moreover, large&#8208;scale OSCF&#8208;based flexible logic circuits, which can be bent without degradation to a radius as small as 4.0 mm and over 1000 cycles are realized. The work provides profound insights into breaking the limitation of flow&#8208;induced anisotropic growth and opens new avenues for printing large&#8208;scale organic single&#8208;crystal electronics.

         <title>Lattice Plainification Leads to High Thermoelectric Performance of P&#8208;Type PbSe Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work enhances the near&#8208;room temperature performance of p&#8208;type PbSe crystals by enhancing carrier mobility via lattice plainification, leading to promising power generation and thermoelectric cooling performance in p&#8208;type Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se&#8208;based devices. This work highlights the potential of p&#8208;type PbSe for power generation and refrigeration near room temperature and will motivate more research on developing new thermoelectric coolers.








Abstract
Thermoelectrics has applications in power generation and refrigeration. Since only commercial Bi2Te3 has a low abundance Te, PbSe gets attention. This work enhances the near&#8208;room temperature performance of p&#8208;type PbSe through enhancing carrier mobility via lattice plainification. Composition controlled and Cu&#8208;doped p&#8208;type PbSe crystals are grown through physical vapor deposition. Results exhibit an enhanced carrier mobility &#8776;2578&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se. Microstructure characterization and density functional theory calculations verify the introduced Cu atoms filled Pb vacancies, realizing lattice plainification and enhancing the carrier mobility. The Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se sample achieves a power factor &#8776;42&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 and a ZT &#8776; 0.7 at 300&#160;K. The average ZT of it reaches &#8776;0.9 (300&#8211;573&#160;K), resulting in a single&#8208;leg power generation efficiency of 7.1% at temperature difference of 270&#160;K, comparable to that of p&#8208;type commercial Bi2Te3. A 7&#8208;pairs device paired the p&#8208;type Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se with the n&#8208;type commercial Bi2Te3 shows a maximum cooling temperature difference &#8776;42&#160;K with the hot side at 300&#160;K, &#8776;65% of that of the commercial Bi2Te3 device. This work highlights the potential of p&#8208;type PbSe for power generation and refrigeration near room temperature and hope to inspire researchers on replacing commercial Bi2Te3.

         <title>Asymmetric Electron Redistribution in Niobic&#8208;Oxygen Vacancy Associates to Tune Noncovalent Interaction in CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates are engineered into niobic acid atomic layers via Ar plasma etching. The intrinsic charge compensation from O to Nb around Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates can manipulate the active electronic states, leading to the asymmetric electron redistribution. These local symmetry breaking sites show a charge density gradient, forming a localized polarization field to polarize nonpolar CO2 molecules and tune the noncovalent interaction of reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The role of vacancy associates in photocatalytic CO2 reduction is an open question. Herein, the Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates (VNb&#9472;O) are engineered into niobic acid (NA) atomic layers to tailor the CO2 photoreduction performance. The intrinsic charge compensation from O to Nb around Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates can manipulate the active electronic states, leading to the asymmetric electron redistribution. These local symmetry breaking sites show a charge density gradient, forming a localized polarization field to polarize nonpolar CO2 molecules and tune the noncovalent interaction of reaction intermediates. This unique configuration contributes to the 9.3 times increased activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Meantime, this VNb&#9472;O NA also shows excellent photocatalytic activity for NO3&#8722;&#8211;NH4+ synthesis, with NH4+ formation rate up to 3442&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This work supplies fresh insights into the vacancy associate design for electron redistribution and noncovalent interaction tuning in photocatalysis.

This unique configuration contributes to the 9.3 times increased activity for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Meantime, this V&lt;sub&gt;Nb&#9472;O&lt;/sub&gt; NA also shows excellent photocatalytic activity for NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

This work supplies fresh insights into the vacancy associate design for electron redistribution and noncovalent interaction tuning in photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Contactless User&#8208;Interactive Sensing Display for Human&#8211;Human and Human&#8211;Machine Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a single&#8208;device contactless user&#8208;interaction sensing display by integrating humidity&#8208;sensing humidity hydrogel with an alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) device. The conductivity changes of the hydrogel as a fingertip approaches or from a human breath trigger the subsecond dynamic response of the ACEL, facilitating noncontact sensing and display.








Abstract
Creating a large&#8208;scale contactless user&#8208;interactive sensing display (CUISD) with optimal features is challenging but crucial for efficient human&#8211;human or human&#8211;machine interactions. This study reports a CUISD based on dynamic alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) that responds to humidity. Subsecond humidity&#8208;induced luminescence is achieved by integrating a highly responsive hydrogel into the ACEL layer. The patterned silver nanofiber electrode and luminescence layer, produced through electrospinning and microfabrication, result in a stretchable, large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;resolution, multicolor, and dynamic CUISD. The CUISD is implemented for the real&#8208;time control of a remote&#8208;controlled car, wherein the luminescence signals induced by touchless finger movements are distinguished and encoded to deliver specific commands. Moreover, the distinctive recognition of breathing facilitates the CUISD to serve as a visual signal transmitter for information interaction, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with disabilities. The paradigm shift depicts in this work is expected to reshape the way authors interact with each other and devices, discovering niche applications in virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse.

         <title>A Solid&#8211;Liquid Bicontinuous Fiber with Strain&#8208;Insensitive Ionic Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize strain&#8208;insensitive ionic conduction for high&#8208;fidelity signal transmission, a solid&#8211;liquid bicontinuous fiber via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation is designed. The fiber features a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion&#8208;conducting phase, forming highly tortuous ionic channels. Remarkably, stretch mainly straightens these channels, leading to a minimal resistance increase with strain, outperforming the vast majority of existing ionic conductors.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic conductors are crucial for enabling advanced iontronic devices to operate under diverse deformation conditions. However, when employed as interconnects, existing ionic conductors struggle to maintain stable ionic conduction under strain, hindering high&#8208;fidelity signal transmission. Here, it is shown that strain&#8208;insensitive ionic conduction can be achieved by creating a solid&#8211;liquid bicontinuous microstructure. A bicontinuous fiber from polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation, which contains a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion&#8208;conducting phase, is fabricated. The spontaneous partitioning of dissolved salts leads to the formation of a robust self&#8208;wrinkled interface, fostering the development of highly tortuous ionic channels. Upon stretch, these meandering ionic channels are straightened, effectively enhancing ionic conductivity to counteract the strain effect. Remarkably, the fiber retains highly stable ionic conduction till fracture, with only 7% resistance increase at 200% strain. This approach presents a promising avenue for designing durable ionic cables capable of signal transmission with minimal strain&#8208;induced distortion.

         <title>Bacterial Biohybrids for Invasion of Tumor Cells Promote Antigen Cross&#8208;Presentation Through Gap Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bacterial biohybrid is designed by modifying live bacterium VNP20009 (VNP) with chito&#8208;oligosaccharide biopolymers to directly enter into tumor cells and bolster antigen cross&#8208;presentation through VNP&#8208;induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on tumor cells surface, which is achieved through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP.








Abstract
Due to inherent differences in cellular composition and metabolic behavior with host cells, tumor&#8208;harbored bacteria can discriminatorily affect tumor immune landscape. However, the mechanisms by which intracellular bacteria affect antigen presentation process between tumor cells and antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) are largely unknown. The invasion behavior of attenuated Salmonella VNP20009 (VNP) into tumor cells is investigated and an attempt is made to modulate this behavior by modifying positively charged polymers on the surface of VNP. It is found that non&#8208;toxic chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) modified VNP (VNP@COS) bolsters the formation of gap junction between tumor cells and APCs by enhancing the ability of VNP to infect tumor cells. On this basis, a bacterial biohybrid is designed to promote in situ antigen cross&#8208;presentation through intracellular bacteria induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the surface of tumor cells through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP@COS. This strategic integration serves to heighten the immunogenic exposure of tumor antigens; while, preserving the cytotoxic potency of T cells. A strategy is proposed to precisely controlling the function and local effects of microorganisms within tumors.

         <dc:description>
In this work, a fundamental mechanism that pushes the frontiers of ultrafast X&#8208;ray scintillator performance is theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated: the use of nanoscale&#8208;confined surface plasmon polariton modes to tailor the scintillator response time via the Purcell effect. By incorporating nanoplasmonic materials in ultrafast perovskite scintillator devices, this work predicts over tenfold enhancement in decay rate, and 38% reduction in time resolution.








Abstract
The development of X&#8208;ray scintillators with ultrahigh light yields and ultrafast response times is a long sought&#8208;after goal. In this work, a fundamental mechanism that pushes the frontiers of ultrafast X&#8208;ray scintillator performance is theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated: the use of nanoscale&#8208;confined surface plasmon polariton modes to tailor the scintillator response time via the Purcell effect. By incorporating nanoplasmonic materials in scintillator devices, this work predicts over tenfold enhancement in decay rate and 38% reduction in time resolution even with only a simple planar design. The nanoplasmonic Purcell effect is experimentally demonstrated using perovskite scintillators, enhancing the light yield by over 120% to 88 &#177; 11 ph/keV, and the decay rate by over 60% to 2.0 &#177; 0.2 ns for the average decay time, and 0.7 &#177; 0.1 ns for the ultrafast decay component, in good agreement with the predictions of our&#160;theoretical framework. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept X&#8208;ray imaging experiments are performed using nanoplasmonic scintillators, demonstrating 182% enhancement in the modulation transfer function at four line pairs per millimeter spatial frequency. This work highlights the enormous potential of nanoplasmonics in optimizing ultrafast scintillator devices for applications including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight X&#8208;ray imaging and photon&#8208;counting computed tomography.

         <dc:description>
A gradient stiffness&#8208;programmed circuit board (GS&#8208;PCB) that possesses high stretchability and stability with surface mounted chips is introduced. The board comprises a stiffness&#8208;programmed hydrogel substrate and a laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal conductor. By integrating the gel with laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal with exceptional properties, GS&#8208;PCB exhibits higher electromechanical stability than other rigid&#8208;island research.








Abstract
Due to emerging demands in soft electronics, there is an increasing need for material architectures that support robust interfacing between soft substrates, stretchable electrical interconnects, and embedded rigid microelectronics chips. Though researchers have adopted rigid&#8208;island structures to solve the issue, this approach merely shifts stress concentrations from chip&#8208;conductor interfaces to rigid&#8208;island&#8208;soft region interfaces in the substrate. Here, a gradient stiffness&#8208;programmed circuit board (GS&#8208;PCB) that possesses high stretchability and stability with surface mounted chips is introduced. The board comprises a stiffness&#8208;programmed hydrogel substrate and a laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal conductor. The hydrogel simultaneously obtains a large stiffness disparity and robust interfaces between rigid&#8208;islands and soft regions. These seemingly contradictory conditions are accomplished by adopting a gradient stiffness structure at the interfaces, enabled by combining polymers with different interaction energies and a supercooled sodium acetate solution. By integrating the gel with laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal with exceptional properties, GS&#8208;PCB exhibits higher electromechanical stability than other rigid&#8208;island research. To highlight the practicality of this approach, a finger&#8208;sensor device that successfully distinguishes objects by direct physical contact is fabricated, demonstrating its stability under various mechanical disturbances.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Tandem Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction&#8208;Like Charge&#8208;Generation Layers</title>

A bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;like CGL enabled by a spontaneously formed microstructured interface is fabricated with a charge&#8208;generation efficiency (CGE) exceeding 115%. Combined with the optimized LEE, a tandem QLED with low turn&#8208;on voltage of 4.0&#160;V and record peak EQE of 42.9% is achieved. An optical&#8208;electrical dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting display based on a dichromatic tandem QLED is proposed.








Abstract
In this study, the fundamental but previously overlooked factors of charge generation efficiency and light extraction efficiency (LEE) are explored and collaboratively optimized in tandem quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). By spontaneously forming a microstructured interface, a bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;like charge&#8208;generation layer composed of a poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)/ZnO bilayer is fabricated and an ideal charge&#8208;generation efficiency surpassing 115% is obtained. The coupling strength of the waveguide mode for the top unit and the plasmon polariton loss for the bottom unit are highly suppressed using precise thickness control, which increases the LEE of the tandem devices. The red tandem QLED achieves an exceptionally low turn&#8208;on voltage for electroluminescence at 4.0&#160;V and outstanding peak external quantum efficiency of 42.9%. The ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage originates from the sequential electroluminescence turn&#8208;on of the two emissive units of the tandem QLED. Benefiting from its unique electroluminescent features, an easily fabricated optical&#8208;electrical dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting display is built by combining a dichromatic tandem QLED with masking technology.

         <title>Gradient High&#8208;Q Dielectric Metasurfaces for Broadband Sensing and Control of Vibrational Light&#8208;Matter Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mid&#8208;infrared all&#8208;dielectric gradient metasurfaces, realized by gradually varying unit cell parameters along the structure, provide continuous tuning of high&#8208;Q resonances over an ultra&#8208;broad spectral range in a compact device footprint. The unmatched flexibility of such metasurfaces for SEIRA applications, including polymer mixture deconvolution, sensitive broadband biomolecule detection, and exploring the onset of vibrational strong coupling are demonstrated.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) has emerged as a powerful technique for ultrasensitive chemical&#8208;specific analysis. SEIRA can be realized by employing metasurfaces that can enhance light&#8208;matter interactions in the spectral bands of molecular vibrations. Increasing sample complexity emphasizes the need for metasurfaces that can operate simultaneously at different spectral bands, both accessing rich spectral information over a broad band, and resolving subtle differences in the absorption fingerprints through narrow&#8208;band resonances. Here, a novel concept of resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces is introduced, where the required spectral selectivity is achieved via local high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor (high&#8208;Q) resonances, while the continuous coverage of a broad band is enabled by the gradual adjustment of the unit&#8208;cell dimensions along the planar structure. The highly tailorable design of the gradient metasurfaces provides flexibility for shaping the spectral sampling density to match the relevant bands of target analytes while keeping a compact device footprint. The versatility of the gradient metasurfaces is demonstrated through several sensing scenarios, including polymer mixture deconvolution, detecting a multistep bioassay, and identification of the onset of vibrational strong coupling regime. The proposed gradient&#8208;resonance platform significantly contributes to the rapidly evolving landscape of nonlocal metasurfaces, enabling applications in molecular detection and analysis of fundamental light&#8208;matter interaction phenomena.

High&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic (OVP) with efficiency exceeding 20% is achieved via the self&#8208;assembled interlayer (SAI) strategy. The use of 2PACz&#8208;SAI advances the surface/interface optoelectronic properties, including mitigated parasitic absorption, improved optical field distribution and the carrier dynamics. Moreover, the efficacy of SAI strategy is widely proved. Additionally, the 2PACz&#8208;SAI based ST&#8208;OPV exhibits a record light utilization efficiency of 5.34%.








Abstract
Interfacial layers (ILs) are prerequisites to form the selective charge transport for high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics (OPVs) but mostly result in considerable parasitic absorption loss. Trimming the ILs down to a mono&#8208;molecular level via the self&#8208;assembled monolayer is an effective strategy to mitigate parasitic absorption loss. However, such a strategy suffers from inferior electrical contact with low surface coverage on rough surfaces and poor producibility. To address these issues, here, the self&#8208;assembled interlayer (SAI) strategy is developed, which involves a thin layer of 2&#8211;6&#160;nm to form a full coverage on the substrate via both covalent and van der Waals bonds by using a self&#8208;assembled molecule of 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) (2PACz). Via the facile spin coating without further rinsing and annealing process, it not only optimizes the electrical and optical properties of OPVs, which enables a world&#8208;record efficiency of 20.17% (19.79% certified) but also simplifies the tedious processing procedure. Moreover, the SAI strategy is especially useful in improving the absorbing selectivity for semi&#8208;transparent OPVs, which enables a record light utilization efficiency of 5.34%. This work provides an effective strategy of SAI to optimize the optical and electrical properties of OPVs for high&#8208;performance and solar window applications.

         <title>Spontaneous Wetting Induced by Contact&#8208;Electrification at Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When a droplet spreads on a polymer surface, simultaneous charge exchange occurs at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Repeated contact electrification leads to accumulated charges on the substrate, inducing spontaneous wetting phenomena. Contact angle variation strongly depends on surface charge density. Contact electrification induced wetting (CEW) can alter contact angles by 5&#176;~38&#176; across different materials.








Abstract
Wettability significantly influences various surface interactions and applications at the liquid&#8211;solid interface. However, the understanding is complicated by the intricate charge exchange occurring through contact electrification (CE) during this process. The understanding of the influence of triboelectric charge on wettability remains challenging, especially due to the complexities involved in concurrently measuring contact angles and interfacial electrical signals. Here, the relationship is investigated between surface charge density and change of contact angle of dielectric films after contact with water droplets. It is observed that the charge exchange when water spared lead to a spontaneous wetting phenomenon, which is termed as the contact electrification induced wetting (CEW). Notably, these results demonstrate a linear dependence between the change of contact angle (CA) of the materials and the density of surface charge on the solid surface. Continuous CEW tests show that not only the static CA but also the dynamics of wetting are influenced by the accumulation charges at the interface. The mechanism behind CEW involves the redistribution of surface charges on a solid surface and polar water molecules within liquid. This interaction results in a decrease in interface energy, leading to a reduction in the CA. Ab initio calculations suggest that the reduction in interface energy may stem from the enhanced surface charge on the substrate, which strengthens the hydrogen bond interaction between water and the substrate. These findings have the potential to advance the understanding of CE and wetting phenomena, with applications in energy harvesting, catalysis, and droplet manipulation at liquid&#8211;solid interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;When a droplet spreads on a polymer surface, simultaneous charge exchange occurs at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Repeated contact electrification leads to accumulated charges on the substrate, inducing spontaneous wetting phenomena. Contact angle variation strongly depends on surface charge density. Contact electrification induced wetting (CEW) can alter contact angles by 5&#176;~38&#176; across different materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wettability significantly influences various surface interactions and applications at the liquid&#8211;solid interface. However, the understanding is complicated by the intricate charge exchange occurring through contact electrification (CE) during this process. The understanding of the influence of triboelectric charge on wettability remains challenging, especially due to the complexities involved in concurrently measuring contact angles and interfacial electrical signals. Here, the relationship is investigated between surface charge density and change of contact angle of dielectric films after contact with water droplets. It is observed that the charge exchange when water spared lead to a spontaneous wetting phenomenon, which is termed as the contact electrification induced wetting (CEW). Notably, these results demonstrate a linear dependence between the change of contact angle (CA) of the materials and the density of surface charge on the solid surface. Continuous CEW tests show that not only the static CA but also the dynamics of wetting are influenced by the accumulation charges at the interface. The mechanism behind CEW involves the redistribution of surface charges on a solid surface and polar water molecules within liquid. This interaction results in a decrease in interface energy, leading to a reduction in the CA. Ab initio calculations suggest that the reduction in interface energy may stem from the enhanced surface charge on the substrate, which strengthens the hydrogen bond interaction between water and the substrate. These findings have the potential to advance the understanding of CE and wetting phenomena, with applications in energy harvesting, catalysis, and droplet manipulation at liquid&#8211;solid interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Entropy Alloys Enable Durable and Efficient Lithium&#8208;Mediated CO2 Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, hcp NiFeCoCuRu HEAs with a 2.17 nm particle size, immobilized on KB matrix at 30 wt%, are designed. HEA30/KB catalyst exhibits robust performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries (LCBs), achieving &#8776;3000 h stability and low overpotential (0.82 V). XAS analyses and theoretical calculations reveal charge redistribution and active clusters of Ru, Co, and Ni as key factors.








Abstract
Designing electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for multistep reduction and oxidation reactions is challenging. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are intriguing due to their tunable geometric and electronic structure through entropy effects. However, understanding the origin of their exceptional performance and identifying active centers is hindered by the diverse microenvironment in HEAs. Herein, NiFeCoCuRu HEAs designed with an average diameter of 2.17 nm, featuring different adsorption capacities for various reactants and intermediates in Li&#8208;mediated CO2 redox reactions, are introduced. The electronegativity&#8208;dependent nature of NiFeCoCuRu HEAs induces significant charge redistribution, shifting the d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level and forming highly active clusters of Ru, Co, and Ni for Li&#8208;based compounds adsorptions. This lowers energy barriers and simultaneously stabilizes *LiCO2 and LiCO3+CO intermediates, enhancing the efficiency of both CO2 reduction and Li2CO3 decomposition over extended periods. This work provides insights into specific active site interactions with intermediates, highlighting the potential of HEAs as promising catalysts for intricate CO2 redox reactions.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Fluorophores: Ultrabright Fluorescent Supramolecular Assemblies Derived from Conventional Fluorophores in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent supramolecular assemblies in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra&#8208;fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in Supra&#8208;fluorophores with high brightness.








Abstract
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) with exceptional brightness hold significant promise for demanding fluorescence bioimaging applications. Although considerable efforts are invested in developing novel organic dyes with enhanced performance, augmenting the brightness of conventional fluorophores is still one of the biggest challenges to overcome. This study presents a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra&#8208;fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. To achieve this, this course has employed a cylindrical nanoparticle with a hydrophobic microdomain, assembled by a cyclic peptide&#8208;diblock copolymer conjugate in water, as a supramolecular scaffold. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of the scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in fluorescent NPs with high brightness. This strategy is applicable to a broad spectrum of fluorophore families, covering polyaromatic hydrocarbons, coumarins, boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes, cyanines, xanthenes, and squaraines. The resulting fluorescent NPs demonstrate high fluorescence quantum yield (&gt;30%) and brightness per volume (as high as 12&#160;060 m&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 nm&#8722;3). Moreover, high&#8208;performance NPs with emission in the NIR region are constructed, showcasing up to 20&#8208;fold increase in both brightness and photostability. This Supra&#8208;fluorophore strategy offers a versatile and effective method for transforming existing fluorophores into ultrabright fluorescent NPs in aqueous environments, for applications such as bioimaging.

Stretchable Electronics
A major challenge in stretchable electronics integration is the stress concentration that occurs at the interface of rigid chips and soft conductors. Article number 2313344 by Seung Hwan Ko and co&#8208;workers solves the issue by fabricating a gradient stiffness&#8208;programmed circuit board. Notably, the circuit board fully utilizes the spatially controlled phase&#8208;transition of supercooled hydrogel.

Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
In article number 2311020, Lian Duan, Gang Cheng, Chi&#8208;Ming Che, and co&#8208;workers describe a novel colour&#8208;tunable OLED (CT&#8208;OLED) based on a single Pt(II)&#8208;dibenzofuran emitter, which can essentially avoid colour&#8208;aging issue, and achieve high efficiency and superior operational lifetime. An electromyography (EMG) visualization system equipped with CT&#8208;OLED is designed to visualize the EMG signal in real time by varied emission color, showing broad application prospects of the developed CT&#8208;OLEDs in wearable biomedical sensors.

Nanoplasmonic Purcell Effect
In article number 2309410, Liang Jie Wong, Muhammad Danang Birowosuto, Christophe Dujardin, and co&#8208;workers present a fundamental mechanism enhancing ultrafast X&#8208;ray scintillator performance: the use of nanoscale&#8208;confined surface plasmon polariton modes to tailor scintillator light yield and response time via the Purcell effect. Incorporating nanoplasmonic structures in ultrafast perovskite scintillator devices yields over tenfold enhancement in decay rate, and a 38% reduction in time resolution.

3D&#8208;Encoding Display
In article number 2401659, Tao Chen, Wei Lu, Chuanzhuang Zhao, and co&#8208;workers propose a supramolecular host&#8208;guest interaction gating strategy that is capable of dynamically programming or even gating the thermo&#8208;responsiveness of smart hydrogel actuators after material manufacture. Thus, a robust chemical&#8208;gated 3D&#8208;encoding information carrier with enhanced display security is demonstrated by replicating the chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function of cephalopods' skin muscles for on&#8208;demand color/pattern display.

Bioengineered Human Embryo Models
Here, a bioengineered human stem cell&#8208;based embryo model can be seen that models a monochorionic twin embryo right before it would implant into the womb. It contains a cystic GATA3+ trophectoderm&#8208;like epithelium (in red) encasing two distinct inner cell masses (in green the epiblast&#8208;like cells and in blue the hypoblast&#8208;like cells). More details can be found in article number 2313306 by Stefan Giselbrecht, Erik J. Vrij, and co&#8208;workers.

Skin Secretion of Andrias davidianus&#8208;Patch
A nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the skin secretion of SSAD is developed, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is potentially adaptable to broad applications, under different pH values and air or liquid pressures, in sutureless wound sealing and healing. More details can be found in article number 2309774 by Yu Shrike Zhang, Jinlin Song, Ximu Zhang, and co&#8208;workers.

X&#8208;Ray Circular Dichroism
In article number 2309172, Atsushi Fujimori, Di&#8208;Jing Huang, and co&#8208;workers unveil a giant X&#8208;ray circular dichroism in a collinear antiferromagnet with a chiral lattice, possessing time&#8208;reversal symmetry. This unique material qualifies as an altermagnet, characterized by fully compensated spins and the breaking of the combined symmetry of parity and time reversal. Below the transition temperature of collinear antiferromagnetism, X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism enhances remarkably, and its sign of domains with opposite chiralities reverses, highlighting one of the intriguing features of altermagnets.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research summarizes the research progress of single atom catalysts (SACs) in petrochemical catalytic reaction process, proposes the role of structural regulation of SACs in enhancing catalytic performance, elucidates reaction mechanisms of SACs in the petrochemical processes, and then provides outlook on design, identification of active sites and the application of artificial intelligence technology for achieving scale&#8208;up application of SACs.








Abstract
Petroleum, as the &#8220;lifeblood&#8221; of industrial development, is the important energy source and raw material. The selective transformation of petroleum into high&#8208;end chemicals is of great significance, but still exists enormous challenges. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100% atom utilization and homogeneous active sites, promise a broad application in petrochemical processes. Herein, the research systematically summarizes the recent research progress of SACs in petrochemical catalytic reaction, proposes the role of structural design of SACs in enhancing catalytic performance, elucidates the catalytic reaction mechanisms of SACs in the conversion of petrochemical processes, and reveals the high activity origins of SACs at the atomic scale. Finally, the key challenges are summarized and an outlook on the design, identification of active sites, and the appropriate application of artificial intelligence technology is provided for achieving scale&#8208;up application of SACs in petrochemical process.

         <title>Nanoscale Methods for Longitudinal Extraction of Intracellular Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Longitudinal analysis of cell dynamics is key to advancing biological and medical research, yet traditional methods disrupt cells, limiting sampling to single timepoints and overlooking cellular heterogeneity. Reversibly accessing the cellular membrane for non&#8208;destructive extraction of intracellular contents is a novel concept achieved by recent nanoscale technologies. This perspective explores these nanoscale innovations and addresses challenges in attaining rigorous sampling.








Abstract
Longitudinal analysis of intracellular contents including gene and protein expression is crucial for deciphering the fundamentally dynamic nature of cells. This offers invaluable insights into complex tissue composition and behavior, and drives progress in disease diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and drug development. Traditional longitudinal analysis workflows, involving the destruction of cells at various timepoints, limit insights to singular moments and fail to account for cellular heterogeneity. Current non&#8208;destructive approaches, like temporal modeling with single&#8208;cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA&#8208;seq) and live&#8208;cell fluorescence imaging, either rely on biological assumptions or possess the risk of cellular perturbation. Recent advances in nanoscale technologies for non&#8208;destructive intracellular content extraction offer a promising solution to these challenges. These novel methods work at the nanoscale to non&#8208;destructively access cellular membranes and can be broadly classified into three mechanisms: tip&#8208;facilitated aspiration, membrane&#8208;based, and probe&#8208;based methods. This perspective focuses on these emerging nanotechnologies for repeated intracellular content extraction. Their potential in longitudinal analysis is discussed, the critical requirements for effective repeated sampling are addressed, and the suitability of each technique for various applications is explored. Furthermore, unresolved challenges in repeated sampling are highlighted to encourage further research in this growing field.

         <title>Understanding Advanced Transition Metal&#8208;Based Two Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts from the Perspective of Phase Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review expounds on how phase engineering can essentially revive the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction performance of transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the design of advanced transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts at the atomic scale, which is expected to inspire further research in the development of novel transition metal&#8208;based two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble transition metal (TM)&#8208;based compounds have recently become a focal point of extensive research interest as electrocatalysts for the two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) process. To efficiently drive this reaction, these TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts must bear unique physiochemical properties, which are strongly dependent on their phase structures. Consequently, adopting engineering strategies toward the phase structure has emerged as a cutting&#8208;edge scientific pursuit, crucial for achieving high activity, selectivity, and stability in the electrocatalytic process. This comprehensive review addresses the intricate field of phase engineering applied to non&#8208;noble TM&#8208;based compounds for 2e&#8722; ORR. First, the connotation of phase engineering and fundamental concepts related to oxygen reduction kinetics and thermodynamics are succinctly elucidated. Subsequently, the focus shifts to a detailed discussion of various phase engineering approaches, including elemental doping, defect creation, heterostructure construction, coordination tuning, crystalline design, and polymorphic transformation to boost or revive the 2e&#8722; ORR performance (selectivity, activity, and stability) of TM&#8208;based catalysts, accompanied by an insightful exploration of the phase&#8208;performance correlation. Finally, the review proposes fresh perspectives on the current challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field, together with several critical research directions for the future development of non&#8208;noble TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Unveiling Confinement Engineering for Achieving High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the innovative confinement effect in rechargeable batteries, presenting a promising approach to address key challenges. It delves into categorizing confinement across scales and proposing strategic designs for manipulating physicochemical properties, electrode stability, and ion transfer. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for harnessing confinement to develop high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
The confinement effect, restricting materials within nano/sub&#8208;nano spaces, has emerged as an innovative approach for fundamental research in diverse application fields, including chemical engineering, membrane separation, and catalysis. This confinement principle recently presents fresh perspectives on addressing critical challenges in rechargeable batteries. Within spatial confinement, novel microstructures and physiochemical properties have been raised to promote the battery performance. Nevertheless, few clear definitions and specific reviews are available to offer a comprehensive understanding and guide for utilizing the confinement effect in batteries. This review aims to fill this gap by primarily summarizing the categorization of confinement effects across various scales and dimensions within battery systems. Subsequently, the strategic design of confinement environments is proposed to address existing challenges in rechargeable batteries. These solutions involve the manipulation of the physicochemical properties of electrolytes, the regulation of electrochemical activity, and stability of electrodes, and insights into ion transfer mechanisms. Furthermore, specific perspectives are provided to deepen the foundational understanding of the confinement effect for achieving high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. Overall, this review emphasizes the transformative potential of confinement effects in tailoring the microstructure and physiochemical properties of electrode materials, highlighting their crucial role in designing novel energy storage devices.

         <title>Photoluminescent Characterization of Metal Nanoclusters: Basic Parameters, Methods, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters have recently emerged as a promising class of luminescent materials. Photoluminescent characterization plays a huge role in revealing the luminescent mechanism of nanoclusters and designing nanocluster&#8208;based applications. This review discusses the parameters and measurement methods in characterizing luminescent nanoclusters from the basic principles to the revelation of luminescent mechanisms and construction of practical applications.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (MNCs) can be synthesized with atomically precise structures and molecule formulae due to the rapid development of nanocluster science in recent decades. The ultrasmall size range (normally &lt; 2 nm) endows MNCs with plenty of molecular&#8208;like properties, among which photoluminescent properties have aroused extensive attention. Tracing the research and development processes of luminescent nanoclusters, various photoluminescent analysis and characterization methods play a significant role in elucidating luminescent mechanism and analyzing luminescent properties. In this review, it is aimed to systematically summarize the normally used photoluminescent characterizations in MNCs including basic parameters and methods, such as excitation/emission wavelength, quantum yield, and lifetime. For each key parameter, first its definition and meaning is introduced and then the relevant characterization methods including measuring principles and the revelation of luminescent properties from the collected data are discussed. Then, it is discussed in details how to explore the luminescent mechanism of MNCs and construct NC&#8208;based applications based on the measured data. By means of these characterization strategies, the luminescent properties of MNCs and NC&#8208;based designs can be explained quantitatively and qualitatively. Hence, this review is expected to provide clear guidance for researchers to characterize luminescent MNCs and better understand the luminescent mechanism from the measured results.

         <title>All&#8211;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells: Defect Regulation and Emerging Applications in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes defect formation causes, discusses the defect regulation strategies for all&#8211;inorganic PSCs from interface, internal, and surface engineering in recent years, and overviews the development in terrestrial ecosystem, alongside conducting an in&#8208;depth analysis and summary of their potential developmental stage under extreme conditions such as those encountered in space and underwater environments.








Abstract
All&#8211;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), such as CsPbX3, have garnered considerable attention recently, as they exhibit superior thermodynamic and optoelectronic stabilities compared to the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PSCs. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbX3 PSCs is generally lower than that of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PSCs, as they contain higher defect densities at the interface and within the perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layers, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative recombination and voltage loss. Consequently, defect regulation has been adopted as an important strategy to improve device performance and stability. This review aims to comprehensively summarize recent progresses on the defect regulation in CsPbX3 PSCs, as well as their cutting&#8208;edge applications in extreme scenarios. The underlying fundamental mechanisms leading to the defect formation in the crystal structure of CsPbX3 PSCs are firstly discussed, and an overview of literature&#8208;adopted defect regulation strategies in the context of interface, internal, and surface engineering is provided. Cutting&#8208;edge applications of CsPbX3 PSCs in extreme environments such as outer space and underwater situations are highlighted. Finally, a summary and outlook are presented on future directions for achieving higher efficiencies and superior stability in CsPbX3 PSCs.

         <title>A Critical Review on Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: From Research Advances to Practical Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical review on remaining challenges and promising solutions for the practical applications of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries is presented. The significance of various crucial parameters for the actual gravimetric energy density of RT&#8208;Na/S batteries is highlighted, and suggestions for the practical values of the crucial parameters are rationally proposed.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries are promising alternatives for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density and high power density. However, some notorious issues are hampering the practical application of RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Besides, the working mechanism of RT&#8208;Na/S batteries under practical conditions such as high sulfur loading, lean electrolyte, and low capacity ratio between the negative and positive electrode (N/P ratio), is of essential importance for practical applications, yet the significance of these parameters has long been disregarded. Herein, it is comprehensively reviewed recent advances on Na metal anode, S cathode, electrolyte, and separator engineering for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. The discrepancies between laboratory research and practical conditions are elaborately discussed, endeavors toward practical applications are highlighted, and suggestions for the practical values of the crucial parameters are rationally proposed. Furthermore, an empirical equation to estimate the actual energy density of RT&#8208;Na/S pouch cells under practical conditions is rationally proposed for the first time, making it possible to evaluate the gravimetric energy density of the cells under practical conditions. This review aims to reemphasize the vital importance of the crucial parameters for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries to bridge the gaps between laboratory research and practical applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of organic electrocatalysts is proposed including classifying all kinds of organic electrocatalysts into four types and identifying indicators/descriptors of electrocatalytic activities based on their influence on four fundamental electrochemical characteristics determining the overall performance of electrocatalysis. Moreover, five strategies for fully revealing the original electrocatalytic activity and stability of organic electrocatalyst in practical applications are also concluded.








Abstract
Efficient electrocatalysts are pivotal for advancing green energy conversion technologies. Organic electrocatalysts, as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble&#8208;metal benchmarks, have garnered attention. However, the understanding of the relationships between their properties and electrocatalytic activities remains ambiguous. Plenty of research articles regarding low&#8208;cost organic electrocatalysts started to gain momentum in 2010 and have been flourishing recently though, a review article for both entry&#8208;level and experienced researchers in this field is still lacking. This review underscores the urgent need to elucidate the structure&#8211;activity relationship and design suitable electrode structures, leveraging the unique features of organic electrocatalysts like controllability and compatibility for real&#8208;world applications. Organic electrocatalysts are classified into four groups: small molecules, oligomers, polymers, and frameworks, with specific structural and physicochemical properties serving as activity indicators. To unlock the full potential of organic electrocatalysts, five strategies are discussed: integrated structures, surface property modulation, membrane technologies, electrolyte affinity regulation, and addition of anticorrosion species, all aimed at enhancing charge efficiency, mass transfer, and long&#8208;term stability during electrocatalytic reactions. The review offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of organic electrocatalysts and their practical applications, bridging the understanding gap and paving the way for future developments of more efficient green energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Operando Colorations from Real&#8208;Time Growth of 3D&#8208;Printed Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial 3D nanostructures can produce precise and flexible coloration. However, their real&#8208;time color changes during 3D nanoprinting remain unexplored due to the inherent challenges of in situ transient measurements and observations. In this study, we developed and evaluated a 3D&#8208;printing system which supports the operando observation/measurement of the color dynamics of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures fabricated in real time. During 3D printing, the dimensions and geometries of the 3D nanostructures grow over time, producing a large library of optical spectra associated with real&#8208;time color changes. Only a timer is required to define the expected colors from a single 3D print run, which expands the utility of the CIE 1931 diagram. Fin&#8208;like nanostructures are used to toggle colors based on the polarization effect, as well as produce color gradients. Based on structural coloration, we designed and printed nanoarchitectures to animate desired color patterns. Moreover, the resulting color dynamics can also serve as an operando identifier for real&#8208;time structural information during 3D nanoprinting. A single print run enables a comprehensive library of desired colorations to be created efficiently, due to the flexibility in time&#8208;dependent controllability and 3D geometries at the subwavelength scale. Therefore, 3D nanoprinted plasmonic structures displaying time&#8208;varying colorations (4D printing of colors) have a strong potential for application in digital displays, molecular sensors, data storage, and optical security.

During 3D printing, the dimensions and geometries of the 3D nanostructures grow over time, producing a large library of optical spectra associated with real-time color changes. Only a timer is required to define the expected colors from a single 3D print run, which expands the utility of the CIE 1931 diagram. Fin-like nanostructures are used to toggle colors based on the polarization effect, as well as produce color gradients. Based on structural coloration, we designed and printed nanoarchitectures to animate desired color patterns. Moreover, the resulting color dynamics can also serve as an operando identifier for real-time structural information during 3D nanoprinting. A single print run enables a comprehensive library of desired colorations to be created efficiently, due to the flexibility in time-dependent controllability and 3D geometries at the subwavelength scale. Therefore, 3D nanoprinted plasmonic structures displaying time-varying colorations (4D printing of colors) have a strong potential for application in digital displays, molecular sensors, data storage, and optical security.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Switching Hydrophobic Interface with Ionic Valves for Reversible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing hydrophobic interface has proven effective in addressing dendrite growth and side reactions during zinc (Zn) plating in aqueous Zn batteries. However, this solution inadvertently impedes the solvation of Zn2+ with H2O and subsequent ionic transport during Zn stripping, leading to insufficient reversibility. Herein, we propose an adaptive hydrophobic interface that can be switched &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; by ionic valves to accommodate the varying demands for interfacial H2O during both the Zn plating and stripping processes. We validate this concept using octyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (C8TAB) as the ionic valve, which can initiatively establish and remove a hydrophobic interface in response to distinct electric&#8208;field directions during Zn plating and stripping, respectively. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits an extended cycling life over 2500 hours with a high Coulombic efficiency of about 99.8%. The full cells also show impressive capacity retention of over 85% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Our findings provide a new insight into interface design for aqueous metal batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports on the application of gem&#8208;polyhalides as functional groups to guide on&#8208;surface synthesis through distinct growth protocols, illustrating the formation of carbon nanomaterials with varying dimensionality ranging from discrete molecules to extended polymers.








Abstract
The design of innovative carbon&#8208;based nanostructures stands at the forefront of both chemistry and materials science. In this context, &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds are of great interest due to their impact in a variety of fields, including optoelectronics, spintronics, energy storage, sensing and catalysis. Despite extensive research efforts, substantial knowledge gaps persist in the synthesis and characterization of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds with potential implications for science and technology. On&#8208;surface synthesis has emerged as a powerful discipline to overcome limitations associated with conventional solution chemistry methods, offering advanced tools to characterize the resulting nanomaterials. This review specifically highlights recent achievements in the utilization of molecular precursors incorporating carbon geminal (gem)&#8208;polyhalides as functional groups to guide the formation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated 0D species, as well as 1D, quasi&#8208;1D &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers, and 2D nanoarchitectures. By delving into reaction pathways, novel structural designs, and the electronic, magnetic, and topological features of the resulting products, the review provides fundamental insights for a new generation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials.

         <title>The Rise Of Xene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Xenes, comprising mono&#8208;elemental atomic sheets, exhibit Dirac or Dirac&#8208;like quantum behaviour. When interfaced with other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), and metal carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides (MXenes), they demonstrate synergistic physical and chemical characteristics not accessible in individual components. The strategic hybridization of Xenes with specific functional 2D materials enables the attainment of unique physicochemical properties, including structural stability, desirable bandgap, efficient charge carrier injection, flexibility/breaking stress, thermal conductivity, chemical reactivity, catalytic efficiency, molecular adsorption, and wettability. For example, hBN acts as an anti&#8208;oxidative shield, MoS2 injects electrons upon laser excitation, and MXene provides mechanical flexibility. Beyond precise compositional modulations, stacking sequences, and inter&#8208;layer coupling controlled by parameters, achieving scalability and reproducibility in hybridization is crucial for implementing these quantum materials in consumer applications. However, realizing the full potential of these hybrid materials faces challenges such as air gaps, uneven interfaces, and the formation of defects and functional groups. Advanced synthesis techniques, a deep understanding of quantum behaviours, precise control over interfacial interactions, and awareness of cross&#8208;correlations among these factors are essential. Xene&#8208;based hybrids show immense promise for groundbreaking applications in quantum computing, flexible electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. In this timely perspective, we highlight recent discoveries of novel Xenes and their hybrids, emphasizing correlations between synthetic parameters, structure, properties, and applications. We anticipate that these insights will revolutionize diverse industries and technologies.

         <title>Isomerization Engineering of Solid Additives Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells via Manipulating Molecular Stacking and Aggregation of Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Morphology control is crucial in achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) and remains a major challenge in the field of OSC. Solid additive is an effective strategy to fine&#8208;tune morphology, however, the mechanism underlying isomeric solid additives on blend morphology and OSC performance is still vague and urgently requires further investigation. Herein, two solid additives based on pyridazine or pyrimidine as core units, M1 and M2, are designed and synthesized to explore working mechanism of the isomeric solid additives in OSCs. The smaller steric hindrance and larger dipole moment facilitate better &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and aggregation in M1&#8208;based active layer. The M1&#8208;treated all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule OSCs (ASM OSCs) obtain an impressive efficiency of 17.57%, ranking among the highest values for binary ASM OSCs, with 16.70% for M2&#8208;treated counterparts. Moreover, it is imperative to investigate whether the isomerization engineering of solid additives works in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer OSCs. M1&#8208;treated D18&#8208;Cl:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices achieve an exceptional efficiency of 19.70% (certified as 19.34%), among the highest values for OSCs. Our work provides deep insights into the design of solid additives and clarifies the potential working mechanism for optimizing the morphology and device performance through isomerization engineering of solid additives.

         <title>Photo&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy: Fabricating Chromium&#8208;Based Nanocomposites to Enhance CAR&#8208;T Cell Infiltration and Cytotoxicity against Solid Tumors</title>

Abstract
The infiltration and cytotoxicity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cells are crucial for effective elimination of solid tumors. While metallo&#8208;immunotherapy is a promising strategy that can activate the antitumor immunity, its role in promoting CAR&#8208;T cell therapy remains elusive. We have previously reported the first single&#8208;element nanomaterial based on chromium nanoparticles for cancer photo&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy. We report herein an extended study using biodegradable polydopamine as a versatile carrier for these nanoparticles, enabling synergistic CAR&#8208;T cell therapy. The results showed that these nanocomposites with or without further encapsulation of the anticancer drug alpelisib could promote the CAR&#8208;T cell migration and antitumor effect. Upon irradiation with near&#8208;infrared light, they caused mild hyperthermia that could &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment. The administration of B7&#8208;H3 CAR&#8208;T cells to NOD severe combined immunodeficiency gamma mice bearing a human hepatoma or PIK3CA&#8208;mutated breast tumor could significantly inhibit the tumor growth after the induction of tumor hyperthermia by the nanocomposites and promote the secretion of serum cytokines, including IL&#8208;2, IFN&#8208;&#947;, and TNF&#8208;&#945;. The trivalent Cr3+ ions, which are the major degradation product of these nanocomposites, could increase the CXCL13 and CCL3 chemokine expressions to generate tertiary lymphoid structures in the tumor tissues, facilitating the CAR&#8208;T cell infiltration.

         <title>20.2% Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics Employing a &#960;&#8208;Extension Quinoxaline&#8208;Based Acceptor with Ordered Arrangement</title>

Abstract
Organic solar cells, as a cutting&#8208;edge sustainable renewable energy technology, possess a myriad of potential applications, while the bottleneck problem of less than 20% efficiency limits the further development. Simultaneously achieving an ordered molecular arrangement, appropriate crystalline domain size, and reduced nonradiative recombination poses a significant challenge and is pivotal for overcoming efficiency limitations. This study employed a dual strategy involving the development of a novel acceptor and ternary blending to address this challenge. A novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, SMA, characterized by a highly ordered arrangement and high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, was synthesized. By incorporating SMA as a guest acceptor in the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:SMA ternary device, it was observed that SMA staggered the liquid&#8208;solid transition of both donor and acceptor, facilitating acceptor crystallization and ordering while maintaining a suitable domain size. Consequently, the enhanced ordering and doping of high LUMO SMA reduced the Urbach energy and nonradiative recombination. Furthermore, SMA optimized the vertical morphology and reduced bimolecular recombination. As a result, the ternary device achieved a champion efficiency of 20.22%, accompanied by increased voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density, and fill factor. Notably, a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 18.42% was attained for flexible devices based on plastic substrates, marking the highest reported value to date. This study underscores the significant potential of a synergistic approach integrating acceptor material innovation and ternary blending techniques for optimizing bulk heterojunction morphology and photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance in Vacancy&#8208;filling Heuslers due to Kondo&#8208;like Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In efforts to improve thermoelectric efficiency, various tactics have been employed with considerable success to decouple intertwined material attributes. However, the integration of magnetism, derived from the unique spin characteristic that other methods cannot replicate, has been comparatively underexplored and presents an ongoing intellectual challenge. Our previous research has shown that vacancy&#8208;filling Heuslers offer a highly adaptable framework for modulating thermoelectric properties. Here, we demonstrate how intrinsic magnetic&#8208;electrical&#8208;thermal coupling can enhance the thermoelectric performance in a vacancy&#8208;filling Heusler alloy. Our materials, Nb0.75Ti0.25FeCrxSb with 0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.1, feature a fraction of magnetic Cr ions that randomly occupy the vacancy sites of the Nb0.75Ti0.25FeSb half&#8208;Heusler matrix. These alloys achieve a remarkable thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (zT) of 1.21 at 973 K, owing to the increased Seebeck coefficient and decreased thermal conductivity. The mechanism is primarily due to the introduction of magnetism, which increases the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass (reaching levels up to 15 times that of a free electron's mass) and simultaneously reduces the electronic thermal conductivity. Mass and strain&#8208;field fluctuations in the vacancy&#8208;filling Heuslers further reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Even higher zT values can potentially be achieved by carefully balancing electron mobility and effective mass. Our work underscores the substantial prospects for exploiting magnetic&#8208;electrical&#8208;thermal synergies in cutting&#8208;edge thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Interfacial Biomacromolecular Engineering Toward Stable Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfacial instability within aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) spurs technical obstacles including parasitic side reactions and dendrite failure to reach the practical application standards. Here, an interfacial engineering was showcased by employing a bio&#8208;derived zincophilic macromolecule as the electrolyte additive (0.037 wt%), which features a long&#8208;chain configuration with laterally distributed hydroxyl and sulfate anion groups, and has the propensity to remodel the electric double layer of Zn anodes. Tailored Zn2+&#8208;rich compact layer is the result of their adaptive adsorption that effectively homogenizes the interfacial concentration field, while enabling a hybrid nucleation and growth mode characterized as nuclei&#8208;rich and space&#8208;confined dense plating. Further resonated with curbed corrosion and by&#8208;products, a dendrite&#8208;free deposition morphology is achieved. Consequently, the macromolecular&#8208;modified zinc anode delivers over 1250 times of reversible plating/stripping at a practical area capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, as well as a high zinc utilization rate of 85%. The Zn//NH4V4O10 pouch cell with a maximal capacity of 1.02 Ah can be steadily operated at 71.4&#160;mA g&#8722;1 (0.25 C) with 98.7% capacity retained after 50 cycles, which demonstrates the scale&#8208;up capability and highlights a &#8220;low input and high return&#8221; interfacial strategy toward practical AZBs.

         <title>Photoactivation of Millimeters Thick Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Broadband Visible Light using Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that facilitate the conversion of light energy into a mechanical response. In this work, a novel polysiloxane&#8208;based LCE with donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) side&#8208;chains was synthesized using a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. We demonstrate that this approach does not compromise the molecular alignment observed in the traditional Finkelmann method. This easy, single&#8208;batch process provides a robust platform to access well&#8208;aligned, light&#8208;responsive LCE films with thickness ranging from 400&#160;&#956;m to a fourteen&#8208;layer stack that is 5&#160;mm thick. Upon irradiation with low&#8208;intensity broadband visible light (100 to 200&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), these systems undergo 2D planar actuation and complete bleaching. Conversely, exposure to higher&#8208;intensity visible light induces bending followed by contraction (300&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). These processes are repeatable over several cycles. Finally, we demonstrate how light intensity and the resulting heat generation influences the photothermal stationary state equilibrium of DASA, thereby controlling its photoresponsive properties. This work establishes the groundwork for advancement of LCE&#8208;based actuators beyond thin film and UV&#8208;light reliant systems.

         <title>Sophisticated Structural Ceramics Shaped from 3D Printed Hydrogel Preceramic Skeleton</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Shaping ceramic materials into sophisticated architecture with three dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure is desirable in multiapplication yet remains challenge due to their brittle and stiff nature. Herein, we propose a new method to achieve ceramic architectures with unsupported and large&#8208;spanning structure by shaping vat photopolymerization 3D printed hydrogel preceramic skeleton with unique flexible and deformable character. Specifically, the present photopolymerizable hydrogel preceramic achieves one stone, two birds: the photosensitive polymer matrix coupled with ceramic nanoparticles for the first shaping by vat photopolymerization 3D printing and the secondary plasticity of the 3D printed ceramic body through flexible shape deformation of hydrogel networks. Inorganic binder aluminum dihydrogen phosphate serves as hydrogel dispersion medium to achieve ultra&#8208;low shrinkage photopolymerization ceramic. Compared with conventional polymer&#8208;derived photo&#8208;curing ceramics, the linear shrinkage of lamina structure is solely 2%, and which of cubic ceramic structure is just 13.3%. More importantly, one 3D printed preceramic is conducted to reshape repeatedly myriad constructions, realizing reusability of intrinsic brittle ceramic, improving manufacturing fault tolerance rate. Finally, a variety of paradigms for ceramic structure applications are proposed toward stereo circuit, biomedicine, and catalytic applications, breaking the limitation of intrinsic brittleness of ceramic in high&#8208;precision manufacturing of complex ceramic devices.

         <title>Propelling Minimally Invasive Tissue Regeneration With Next&#8208;Era Injectable Pre&#8208;Formed Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injectable pre&#8208;formed scaffolds are revolutionizing regenerative medicine, offering targeted, minimally invasive therapeutic delivery. This review discusses their fabrication, biomaterial advancements, and functionalization strategies, highlighting significant successes in treating age&#8208;related conditions and broadening biomedical applications. Emerging trends and potential impacts in tissue engineering are explored.








Abstract
The growing aging population, with its associated chronic diseases, underscores the urgency for effective tissue regeneration strategies.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Electrocatalysts Base on Catalysis&#8208;Unit Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative approach is presented using catalysis units, simplifying material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to an assembly&#8208;like process. Through Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML), a structure&#8208;performance relationship is established. Integration catalysis units into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrates Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work proposes a streamlined strategy, potentially integrating DFT, ML, and experimental section for efficient functional materials development.








Abstract
It is a pressing need to develop new energy materials to address the existing energy crisis. However, screening optimal targets out of thousands of material candidates remains a great challenge. Herein, an alternative concept for highly effective materials screening based on dual&#8208;atom salphen catalysis units, is proposed and validated. Such an approach simplifies the design of catalytic materials and reforms the trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimental model into a building&#8208;blocks&#8208;assembly like process. First, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on a series of potential catalysis units that are possible to synthesize. Then, machine learning (ML) is employed to define the structure&#8208;performance relationship and acquire chemical insights. Afterward, the projected catalysis units are integrated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to validate the concept Electrochemical tests confirming that Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF are promising conductive agent&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work provides a fast&#8208;tracked strategy for the design and development of functional materials, which serves as a potentially workable framework for seamlessly integrating DFT calculations, ML, and experimental approaches.

         <title>A Versatile Cryomicroneedle Patch for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile cryomicroneedle patch (CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for preserving the high activity of HMME and CAT in vitro and improving bioavailability in vivo, which enhances traceable PDT by O2 generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated GSH depletion.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) continues to encounter multifarious hurdles, stemming from the ineffectual preservation and delivery system of photosensitizers, the dearth of imaging navigation, and the antioxidant/hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Herein, a versatile cryomicroneedle patch (denoted as CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for traceable PDT. The therapeutic efficacy is further amplified by catalase (CAT)&#8208;induced oxygen (O2) generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion. The CMN&#8208;CCPH is composed of cryomicroneedle (CMN) as the vehicle and CAT&#8208;biomineralized copper phosphate nanoflowers (CCP NFs) loaded with hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as the payload. Importantly, the bioactive function of HMME and CAT can be optimally maintained under the protection of CCPH and CMN for a duration surpassing 60 days, leading to bolstered bioavailability and notable enhancements in PDT efficacy. The in vivo visualization of HMME and oxyhemoglobin saturation (sO2) monitored by fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) duplex real&#8208;time imaging unveils the noteworthy implications of CMN&#8208;delivered CCPH for intratumoral enrichment of HMME and O2 with reduced systemic toxicity. This versatile CMN patch demonstrates distinct effectiveness in neoplasm elimination, underscoring its promising clinical prospects.

         <title>Lattice Strain with Stabilized Oxygen Vacancies Boosts Ceria for Robust Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Outperforming Benchmark Pt</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy rare earth (Y) and transition metal (Co) dual&#8208;doping induced lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy, synergistically improve H2O dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, is reported to boost CeO2 for alkaline hydrogen evolution outperforming benchmark Pt. Meanwhile, Y doping stabilized oxygen vacancies due to the stronger Y&#9472;O bond than Ce&#9472;O, endowing the Y,Co&#8208;CeO2 with excellent stability.








Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant metal oxides are usually considered as stable but catalytically inert toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their unfavorable hydrogen intermediate adsorption performance. Herein, a heavy rare earth (Y) and transition metal (Co) dual&#8208;doping induced lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy is proposed to boost CeO2 toward robust alkaline HER. The induced lattice compression and increased oxygen vacancy (Ov) concentration in CeO2 synergistically improve the water dissociation on Ov&#160;sites and sequential hydrogen adsorption at activated Ov&#8208;neighboring sites, leading to significantly enhanced HER kinetics. Meanwhile, Y doping offers stabilization effect on Ov by its stronger Y&#9472;O bonding over Ce&#9472;O, which endows the catalyst with excellent stability. The Y,Co&#8208;CeO2 electrocatalyst exhibits an ultra&#8208;low HER overpotential (27&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Tafel slope (48&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), outperforming the benchmark Pt electrocatalyst. Moreover, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporated with Y,Co&#8208;CeO2 achieves excellent stability of 500&#160;h under 600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This synergistic lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy sheds new light on the rational development of efficient and stable oxide&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Defect&#8208;free Nano&#8208;welding of Bilayer SnSe Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nano&#8208;welding is a bottom&#8208;up technique to create custom designed nanostructures and devices beyond the precision of lithographic methods. Here, we report a new technique based on anisotropic lubricity at the van der Waals interface between monolayer and bilayer SnSe nanoplates and a graphene substrate, to achieve precise control of the crystal orientation and the interface during the welding process. As&#8208;grown SnSe monolayer and bilayer nanoplates are commensurate with graphene's armchair direction but lack commensuration along graphene's zigzag direction, resulting in a reduced friction along that direction and a rail&#8208;like, one dimensional movement that permits joining nanoplates with high precision. This way, molecular beam epitaxially grown SnSe nanoplates of lateral sizes 30&#8764;100&#160;nm are manipulated by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature. In situ annealing is applied afterwards to weld contacting nanoplates without atomic defects at the interface. This technique can be generalized to any van der Waals interfaces with anisotropic lubricity and is highly promising for the construction of complex quantum devices, such as field effect transistors, quantum interference devices, lateral tunneling junctions, and solid&#8208;state qubits.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered PROTAC Nanoassemblies for Photodynamic IDO Proteolysis in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold great potential for persistently reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM) via targeted protein degradation, precisely activating them in tumor tissues and preventing uncontrolled proteolysis at off&#8208;target sites remain challenging. Herein, we report a light&#8208;triggered PROTAC nanoassembly (LPN) for photodynamic indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) proteolysis. The LPN is derived from the self&#8208;assembly of prodrug conjugates, which comprise a PROTAC, cathepsin B&#8208;specific cleavable peptide linker and photosensitizer, without any additional carrier materials. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected LPNs initially silence the activity of PROTACs and accumulate significantly in targeted tumor tissues due to an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Subsequently, the cancer biomarker cathepsin B begins to trigger the release of active PROTACs from the LPNs through enzymatic cleavage of the linkers. Upon light irradiation, tumor cells undergo immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by photodynamic therapy (PDT) to promote the activation of effector T cells, while the continuous IDO degradation of PROTAC simultaneously blocks tryptophan metabolite&#8208;regulated regulatory T cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. Such LPN&#8208;mediated combinatorial photodynamic IDO proteolysis effectively inhibits tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence. Collectively, this study presents a promising nanomedicine, designed to synergize PROTACs with other immunotherapeutic modalities, for more effective and safer cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold great potential for persistently reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM) via targeted protein degradation, precisely activating them in tumor tissues and preventing uncontrolled proteolysis at off-target sites remain challenging. Herein, we report a light-triggered PROTAC nanoassembly (LPN) for photodynamic indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) proteolysis. The LPN is derived from the self-assembly of prodrug conjugates, which comprise a PROTAC, cathepsin B-specific cleavable peptide linker and photosensitizer, without any additional carrier materials. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected LPNs initially silence the activity of PROTACs and accumulate significantly in targeted tumor tissues due to an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Subsequently, the cancer biomarker cathepsin B begins to trigger the release of active PROTACs from the LPNs through enzymatic cleavage of the linkers. Upon light irradiation, tumor cells undergo immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by photodynamic therapy (PDT) to promote the activation of effector T cells, while the continuous IDO degradation of PROTAC simultaneously blocks tryptophan metabolite-regulated regulatory T cell-mediated immunosuppression. Such LPN-mediated combinatorial photodynamic IDO proteolysis effectively inhibits tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence. Collectively, this study presents a promising nanomedicine, designed to synergize PROTACs with other immunotherapeutic modalities, for more effective and safer cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Engineering Reinforced Surface Electronic States and Structural Defects of Hierarchical Metal Oxides@Graphene Fibers towards High&#8208;Performance Wearable Supercapacitors</title>

Abstract
Construction advanced fibers with high Faradic activity and conductivity are effective to realize high energy density with sufficient redox reactions for fiber&#8208;based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs), yet it is generally at the sacrifice of kinetics and structural stability. Here, we propose a high&#8208;entropy doping strategy to develop high&#8208;energy&#8208;density FESCs based on high&#8208;entropy doped metal oxide@graphene fiber composite (HE&#8208;MO@GF). Due to the synergistic participation of multi&#8208;metal elements via high&#8208;entropy doping, the HE&#8208;MO@GF features abundant oxygen vacancies from introducing various low&#8208;valence metal ions, lattice distortions and optimized electronic structure. Consequently, the HE&#8208;MO@GF maintains sufficient active sites, low diffusion barrier, fast adsorption kinetics, improved electronic conductivity, enhanced structural stability, and Faradaic reversibility. Thereinto, HE&#8208;MO@GF presents ultra&#8208;large areal capacitance (3673.74 mF cm&#8722;2) and excellent rate performance (1446.78 mF cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in 6&#160;M KOH electrolyte. The HE&#8208;MO@GF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state FESCs also deliver high energy density (132.85 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2), good cycle performance (81.05% of capacity retention after 10,000 cycles), and robust tolerance to sweat erosion and multiple washing, which is woven into textile to power various wearable devices (e.g., watch, badge and luminous glasses). This high&#8208;entropy strategy provides significant guidance for designing innovative fiber materials, and highlights the development of next&#8208;generation wearable energy devices.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Cardiac Monitoring Capsule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Patients often fail to recognize the early signs of CVDs, which display irregularities in cardiac contractility and may ultimately lead to heart failure. Therefore, continuously monitoring the abnormal changes in cardiac contractility might represent a novel approach to long&#8208;term CVD surveillance. In this study, we introduce a zero&#8208;power consumption and implantable bias&#8208;free cardiac monitoring capsule (BCMC) based on the triboelectric effect for cardiac contractility monitoring in situ. The output performance of BCMC has been improved over 10 times with nanoparticle self&#8208;adsorption method. This device can be implanted into the right ventricle of swine using catheter intervention to detect the change of cardiac contractility and corresponding CVDs. The physiological signals can be wirelessly transmitted to a mobile terminal for analysis through the acquisition and transmission module. This work will contribute to a new option for precise monitoring and early diagnosis of CVDs.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based Polymer Organic Cathode for Extreme Fast Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Ultralong Lifespans</title>

Abstract
The development of new lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with fast charging capabilities has emerged as a critical technological advancement in response to the growing demand for energy storage. The materials used for the electrodes significantly affect the charge and discharge rates of LIBs. Organic electrodes with structural flexibility support fast lithium&#8208;ion transport and are considered promising candidates for building fast&#8208;charging LIBs. However, it is very difficult to create organic electrodes that can cycle steadily and reach high energy density in a few of minutes. To solve this issue, it is imperative to accelerate the transport of electrons and lithium ions in the electrode. Here, we demonstrate that Fc&#8208;SO3Li, a ferrocene&#8208;based polymer electrode, can be used as a fast&#8208;charging organic electrode for LIBs. Thanks to its molecular architecture, LIBs with Fc&#8208;SO3Li can cycle steadily for over 10,000 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 99.99% and reach an energy density of approximately 183&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in 72 seconds. Moreover, optimized electron and ion transmission pathways are achieved by the Fc&#8208;SO3Li&#8208;CNT50 composite material, which is produced by the in&#8208;situ polymerization of monomers and carbon nanotube. After 10,000 cycles at a high current density of 50C, it may still receive a high energy density of approximately 304&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This study provides valuable insights into designing cathode materials for LIBs that combine high power and ultra&#8208;long cycle life.

         <title>Deciphering the Lithium&#8208;ion Conduction Mechanism of LiH in Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>

Abstract
Lithium hydride (LiH) has been widely recognized as the critical component of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Li batteries. Although the formation mechanism and structural model of LiH in SEI have been extensively reported, the role in electro&#8208;performance of LiH in SEI is still&#160;ambiguous and has proven challenging to explored due to the complicated structure SEI and the lack of advanced in&#8208;situ experimental technology. In this study, the isotopic exchange experiments combined with isotopic tracer experiments was applied to solidly illustrate the superior conductivity and Li+ conduction behavior of the LiH in natural SEI. Importantly, in&#8208;situ TEM analysis was utilized to visualize the self&#8208;electrochemical decomposition of LiH, which is significantly distinctive from LiF and Li2O. The critical experimental evidence discovered by our work demonstrates ion transport behaviors of key components in the SEI, which is imperative for designing novel SEI and augurs a new area in optimizing the performance of lithium batteries.

         <title>Injectable and Sprayable Fluorescent Nanoprobe for Rapid Real&#8208;Time Detection of Human Colorectal Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of minimally invasive surgery has greatly advanced precision tumor surgery, but sometimes suffers from restricted visualization of the surgical field, especially during the removal of abdominal tumors. A 3&#8208;D inspection of tumors could be achieved by intravenously injecting tumor&#8208;selective fluorescent probes, whereas most of which are unable to instantly distinguish tumors via in situ spraying, which is urgently needed in the process of surgery in a convenient manner. In this study, we have designed an injectable and sprayable fluorescent nanoprobe, termed Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, to realize rapid tumor imaging in freshly dissected human colorectal tumors and animal models. Mechanistically, the incorporation of &#947;&#8208;glutamyl group facilitates the rapid internalization of Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, and these internalized nanoprobes can be subsequently activated by intracellular NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase&#8208;1 to release near&#8208;infrared fluorophores. As a result, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT can achieve a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (TNR) up to 12.3 and enable a fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying) of tumor boundaries in the xenograft tumor models, Apcmin/+ mice models and fresh human tumor tissues. In addition, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT is capable of identifying minimal premalignant lesions via intravenous injection.

Abstract
Despite multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with small full&#8208;width at half maximum are attractive for wide color&#8208;gamut display and eye&#8208;protection lighting applications, their inefficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and long exciton lifetime inducing serious efficiency roll&#8208;off, which significantly limits their development. Herein, a novel device concept of building highly efficient tricomponent exciplex with multiple RISC channels is proposed to realize reduced exciton quenching and enhanced upconversion of nonradiative triplet excitons, and subsequently used as host for high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Compared with traditional binary exciplex, the tricomponent exciplex exhibits obviously improved photoluminescence quantum yield, emitting dipole orientation and RISC rate constant, and a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.4% is achieved for tricomponent exciplex p&#8208;PhBCzPh: PO&#8208;T2T: DspiroAc&#8208;TRZ (50: 20: 30) based OLED. Remarkably, maximum EQEs of 36.2% and 40.3% and ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQEs of 26.1% and 30.0% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 are respectively achieved for its sky&#8208;blue and pure&#8208;green MR&#8208;TADF doped OLEDs. Additionally, the blue emission unit hosted by tricomponent exciplex is combined with an orange&#8208;red TADF emission unit to achieve a double&#8208;emission&#8208;layer blue&#8208;hazard&#8208;free warm white OLED with an EQEmax of 30.3% and stable electroluminescence spectra over a wide brightness range.

&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters with small full-width at half maximum are attractive for wide color-gamut display and eye-protection lighting applications, their inefficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and long exciton lifetime inducing serious efficiency roll-off, which significantly limits their development. Herein, a novel device concept of building highly efficient tricomponent exciplex with multiple RISC channels is proposed to realize reduced exciton quenching and enhanced upconversion of nonradiative triplet excitons, and subsequently used as host for high-performance MR-TADF organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Compared with traditional binary exciplex, the tricomponent exciplex exhibits obviously improved photoluminescence quantum yield, emitting dipole orientation and RISC rate constant, and a record-breaking external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.4% is achieved for tricomponent exciplex p-PhBCzPh: PO-T2T: DspiroAc-TRZ (50: 20: 30) based OLED.

         <title>Functional Covalent Organic Frameworks Microspheres Synthesized by Self&#8208;limited Dynamic Linker Exchange for Stationary Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Synthesizing uniform functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) microspheres is the prerequisite of applying COFs as novel stationary phases for liquid chromatography. However, the synthesis of functionalized COFs microspheres is challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining microspheric morphology when conferring functions. Here, we develop a facile and universal &#8220;self&#8208;limited dynamic linker exchange&#8221; strategy to achieve surface functionalization of uniform COFs microspheres. Six different types of COFs microspheres are constructed, showing the universality and superiority of the strategy. The library of COFs micro&#8208;spheres stationary phases can be further enriched on demand by varying different functional building blocks. The &#8220;self&#8208;limited dynamic linker exchange&#8221; is attributed to the result of a delicate balance of reaction thermodynamics and molecular diffusion energy barrier. As a demonstration, the chiral functional COFs microspheres are used as stationary phases of chiral chromatography and realized effective enantioseparation.

         <title>Filter&#8208;Less Color&#8208;Selective Photodetector Derived from Integration of Parallel Perovskite Photoelectric Response Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Color&#8208;selective photodetectors (PDs) play an indispensable role in spectral recognition, image sensing and other fields. Nevertheless, complex filters and delicate optical paths in such devices significantly increase their complexity and size, which subsequently impede their integration in smart optoelectronic chips for universal applications. This work demonstrates the successful fabrication of filter&#8208;less color&#8208;selective perovskite PDs by integrating three perovskite units with different photo response on a single chip. The variation in photo response is attributed to different quantities of SnO2 nanoparticles, synthesized through controlled ultrasonic treatment on the surface of the electron transportation layer SnS2, which selectively absorb short&#8208;wavelength light, thus increasing the relative transmittance of long&#8208;wavelength light and enhancing the photo response of the units to long wavelengths. By integrating any two units and deriving the formula for the wavelength to the responsivity ratio, a wavelength sensor is developed which can accurately identify incident light in the range of 400&#8211;700&#160;nm with a minimum error &lt;3&#160;nm. Furthermore, the device integrating three units with different photo response can identify red, green, and blue in polychromatic light to achieve color imaging with a relative error &lt;6%. This work provides valuable insights into wavelength identification and color imaging of perovskite PDs.

         <title>Electrophysiological Analysis of Retinal Organoid Development Using Three&#8208;Dimensional Microelectrodes of Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite of the substantial potential of human&#8208;derived retinal organoids, the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) during maturation limits their utility in assessing the functionality of later&#8208;born retinal cell subtypes. Additionally, conventional analyses primarily rely on fluorescent emissions, which limits the detection of actual cell functionality while risking damage to the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) cytoarchitecture of organoids. Here, we present an electrophysiological analysis to monitor RGC development in early to mid&#8208;stage retinal organoids, and compare distinct features with fully&#8208;mature mouse retina. Our approach utilizes high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of liquid&#8208;metal microelectrodes, enabling precise targeting of specific inner retinal layers within organoids. The adaptable distribution and softness of these microelectrodes facilitate the spatiotemporal recording of inner retinal signals. Our study not only demonstrates the functional properties of RGCs in retinal organoid development but also provides insights into their synaptic connectivity, reminiscent of fetal native retinas. Further comparison with fully&#8208;mature mouse retina in vivo verifies the organoid features, highlighting the potential of early&#8208;stage retinal organoids in biomedical research.

Abstract
Synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics that can recapitulate the complex biochemical and mechanical nature of native tissues are needed for advanced models of development and disease. Biomedical research has heavily relied on the use of animal&#8208;derived biomaterials, which is now impeding their translational potential and convoluting the biological insights gleaned from in vitro tissue models. Natural hydrogels have long served as a convenient and effective cell culture tool, but advances in materials chemistry and fabrication techniques now present promising new avenues for creating xenogenic&#8208;free ECM substitutes appropriate for organotypic models and microphysiological systems. However, significant challenges remain in creating synthetic matrices that can approximate the structural sophistication, biochemical complexity, and dynamic functionality of native tissues. This review summarizes key properties of the native ECM, and discusses recent approaches used to systematically decouple and tune these properties in synthetic matrices. The importance of dynamic ECM mechanics, such as viscoelasticity and matrix plasticity, is also discussed, particularly within the context of organoid and engineered tissue matrices. Emerging design strategies to mimic these dynamic mechanical properties are reviewed, such as multi&#8208;network hydrogels, supramolecular chemistry, and hydrogels assembled from biological monomers.

         <title>MOF&#8208;derived Nanoparticles with Enhanced Acoustical Performance for Efficient Mechano&#8208;Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultrasound generates toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by acting on sonosensitizers for cancer treatment, and the mechanical damage induced by cavitation effects under ultrasound is equally significant. Therefore, designing a novel sonosensitizer that simultaneously possesses efficient ROS generation and enhanced mechanical effects is promising. In this study, we construct carbon&#8208;doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (C&#8208;ZnO) for mechano&#8208;sonodynamic cancer therapy. The presence of carbon doping optimizes the electronic structure, thereby enhancing the ROS generation triggered by ultrasound, efficiently inducing tumor cell death. On the other hand, the high specific surface area and porous structure brought about by carbon doping enable C&#8208;ZnO to enhance the mechanical stress induced by cavitation bubbles under ultrasound irradiation, causing severe mechanical damage to tumor cells. Under the dual effects of sonodynamic therapy and mechanical therapy mediated by C&#8208;ZnO, excellent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, along with a high level of biological safety. This is the first instance of utilizing an inorganic nanomaterial to achieve simultaneous enhancement of ROS production and ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanical effects for cancer therapy. This holds significant importance for the future development of novel sonosensitizers and advancing the applications of ultrasound in cancer treatment.

This holds significant importance for the future development of novel sonosensitizers and advancing the applications of ultrasound in cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Breathable Dual&#8208;Mode Leather&#8208;Like Nanotextile for Efficient Daytime Radiative Cooling and Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Incorporating passive radiative cooling and heating into personal thermal management has attracted tremendous attention. However, most current thermal management materials are usually monofunctional with a narrow temperature regulation range, and lack breathability, softness, and stretchability, resulting in a poor wearer experience and limited application scenarios. Herein, a breathable dual&#8208;mode leather&#8208;like nanotextile (LNT) with asymmetrical wrinkle photonic microstructures and Janus wettability for highly efficient personal thermal management is developed via a one&#8208;step electrospinning technique. The LNT is synthesized by self&#8208;bonding a hydrophilic cooling layer with welding fiber networks onto a hydrophobic photothermal layer, constructing bilayer wrinkle structures that offer remarkable optical properties, a wetting gradient, and unique textures. The resultant LNT exhibits efficient cooling capacity (22.0 &#176;C) and heating capacity (22.1 &#176;C) under sunlight, expanding the thermal management zone (28.3 &#176;C wider than typical textiles). Additionally, it possesses favorable breathability, softness, stretchability, and sweat&#8208;wicking capability. Actual wearing tests demonstrate that the LNT can provide a comfortable microenvironment for the human body (1.6&#8764;8.0 &#176;C cooler and 1.0&#8764;7.1 &#176;C warmer than typical textiles) in changing weather conditions. Such a wearable dual&#8208;mode LNT presents great potential for personal thermal comfort and opens up new possibilities for all&#8208;weather smart clothing.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanoarchitectonics: Recent Advances for Precious Metal Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The recovery of precious metals (PMs) from secondary resources has garnered significant attention due to environmental and economic considerations. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising adsorbents for this purpose, owing to their tunable pore size, facile functionalization, exceptional chemical stability, and large specific surface area. This review provides an overview of the latest research progress in utilizing COFs to recover PMs. Firstly, the design and synthesis strategies of chemically stable COF&#8208;based materials, including pristine COFs, functionalized COFs, and COF&#8208;based composites, are delineated. Furthermore, the application of COFs in the recovery of gold, silver, and platinum group elements is delved into, emphasizing their high adsorption capacity and selectivity as well as recycling ability. Additionally, various interaction mechanisms between COFs and PM ions are analyzed. Finally, the current challenges faced by COFs in the field of PM recovery are discussed, and potential directions for future development are proposed, including enhancing the recyclability and reusability of COF materials and realizing the high recovery of PMs from actual acidic wastewater. With the targeted development of COF&#8208;based materials, the recovery of PMs can be realized more economically and efficiently in the future.

         <title>Efficient Orbitronic Terahertz Emission Based on CoPt Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, we report a more efficient light&#8208;induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the composition of the CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, we confirm that THz emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within CoPt, propagating through Cu, followed by subsequent orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion due to the inverse orbital Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO interface. This study provides strong evidence for the efficient orbital current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way for efficient orbital terahertz emitters.

         <title>UV&#8208;Permeable 3D Li Anodes for in situ Fabrication of Interface&#8208;Gapless Flexible Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are highly desirable for future wearable electronics because of their high energy density and safety. However, flexible SSLMBs face serious challenges not only in regulating the Li stripping/plating behaviors but also in enabling the mechanical flexibility of the cell. Both challenges are largely associated with the interfacial gaps between the solid electrolytes and the electrodes. Here, we report a UV&#8208;permeable and flexible composited Li metal anode (UVp&#8208;Li), which possesses a unique light&#8208;penetrating interwoven structure similar to textiles. UVp&#8208;Li allows one&#8208;step bonding of the cathode, anode, and solid electrolyte via an in situ UV&#8208;initiated polymerization method to achieve the gapless SSLMBs. The gapless structure not only effectively stabilizes the plating/stripping of Li metal during cycling, but also ensures the integrity of the cell during mechanical bending. UVp&#8208;Li symmetric cell presents a stable cycling over 1000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. LFP||UVp&#8208;Li full cells (areal capacity ranging from 0.5 to 3 mAh cm&#8722;2) show outstanding capacity retention of over 84% after 500 charge/discharge cycles at room temperature. Large pouch cells using high&#8208;loading cathodes maintain stable electrochemical performance during 1000 times of dynamic bending.

         <title>Heterostructures via a Solution&#8208;Based Anion Exchange in Microcrystalline 2D Layered Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work outlines solution&#8208;based processes to obtain in&#8208;plane heterojunctions in two&#8208;dimensional layered perovskites with different halide composition. The obtained microcrystalline heterostructures have a core&#8208;shell architecture with distinctly different optical properties in the different crystal phases. This work elucidates the underlying reaction mechanisms that depend strongly on the exchange route, leading either to vacancy&#8208;assisted diffusion, or dissolution&#8208;recrystallization processes.








Abstract
Layered perovskites consist of stacks of inorganic semiconducting metal&#8208;halide octahedra lattices sandwiched between organic layers with typically dielectric behavior. The in&#8208;plane confinement of electrical carriers in such two&#8208;dimensional metal halide perovskites drives a large range of appealing electronic properties, such as strong exciton binding, anisotropic charge diffusion, and polarization&#8208;directionality. Heterostructures provide additional control on carrier diffusion and localization, and in&#8208;plane heterojunctions are interesting because of the associated high charge mobility. Here, this work demonstrates a versatile solution&#8208;based approach to fabricate in&#8208;plane heterostructures with different halide composition in two&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;halide perovskite microcrystals. This leads to spatially separated halide phases with different band gap and light emission. Interestingly, the composition of the exchanged phase and the morphology of the phase boundary depends on the exchange route, which can be related to the preferred localization of the halides at the equatorial or axial octahedra positions that either leads to dissolution and recrystallization of the octahedra lattice (for bromide to iodide), or allows for ion diffusion within the lattice (for iodide to bromide). These detailed insights on the ion exchange processes in layered perovskites will stimulate the development of heterostructures that can be tailored for different applications such as photocatalysis, energy storage, and light emission.

CuPd1Rh1 diatomic alloy is explored as a highly active and selective catalyst toward the UENC, arising from the synergistic effect of Pd1&#8211;Cu and Rh1&#8211;Cu active sites to promote the UENC via a tandem catalysis mechanism, where Pd1&#8211;Cu site triggers the early C&#8211;N coupling and promotes *CO2NO2&#8211;to&#8211;*CO2NH steps, while Rh1&#8211;Cu site facilitates the subsequent protonation step of *CO2NH2 to *COOHNH2 toward the urea formation.








Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from co&#8211;electrolysis of NO3
&#8722; and CO2 (UENC) offers a promising technology for achieving sustainable and efficient urea production. Herein, a diatomic alloy catalyst (CuPd1Rh1&#8211;DAA), with mutually isolated Pd and Rh atoms alloyed on Cu substrate, is theoretically designed and experimentally confirmed to be a highly active and selective UENC catalyst. Combining theoretical computations and operando spectroscopic characterizations reveals the synergistic effect of Pd1&#8211;Cu and Rh1&#8211;Cu active sites to promote the UENC via a tandem catalysis mechanism, where Pd1&#8211;Cu site triggers the early C&#8211;N coupling and promotes *CO2NO2&#8211;to&#8211;*CO2NH steps, while Rh1&#8211;Cu site facilitates the subsequent protonation step of *CO2NH2 to *COOHNH2 toward the urea formation. Impressively, CuPd1Rh1&#8211;DAA assembled in a flow cell presents the highest urea Faradaic efficiency of 72.1% and urea yield rate of 53.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus RHE, representing nearly the highest performance among all reported UENC catalysts.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive &#946;&#8208;Glucans&#8208;Complexed mRNA in LNPs as an Oral Vaccine for Enhancing Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy are commonly delivered using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which, when administered intravenously, may accumulate in the liver, potentially limiting their therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this challenge, the study introduces an oral mRNA vaccine formulation tailored for efficient uptake by immune cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, known for its high concentration of immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs). This formulation comprises mRNA complexed with &#946;&#8208;glucans (&#946;Glus), a potential adjuvant for vaccines, encapsulated within LNPs (&#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs). The &#946;Glus/mRNA complexes within the small compartments of LNPs demonstrate a distinctive ability to partially dissociate and re&#8208;associate, responding to pH changes, effectively shielding mRNA from degradation in the harsh GI environment. Upon oral administration to tumor&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs are effectively taken up by intestinal DCs and local non&#8208;immune cells, bypassing potential liver accumulation. This initiates antigen&#8208;specific immune responses through successful mRNA translation, followed by drainage into the mesenteric lymph nodes to stimulate T cells and trigger specific adaptive immune responses, ultimately enhancing antitumor effects. Importantly, the vaccine demonstrates safety, with no significant inflammatory reactions observed. In conclusion, the potential of oral &#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs delivery presents a promising avenue in cancer immunotherapy, offering needle&#8208;free and user&#8208;friendly administration for widespread adoption and self&#8208;administration.

         <title>Plasma Coupled Electrolyte Additive Strategy for Construction of High&#8208;Performance Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Li Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel plasma coupled electrolyte additive strategy to construct high&#8208;quality gradient SEI composed of inner inorganic layer (LiBr, Li2CO3) and outer organic layer (LiBr, Li2CO3, organic lithium compounds (OLCs), in which free radicals reaction mechanism and induction mechanism are proposed. The optimized lithium anode shows fast transport kinetics of Li+, strong affinity toward Li+ and good mechanical properties. Accordingly, the cells show much better performance than the counterparts.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes are crucial for the development of advanced Li metal batteries. Herein, this work reports a novel plasma coupled electrolyte additive strategy to prepare high&#8208;quality composite solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li metal to achieve enhanced performance and stability. With the guidance of calculations, this work selects diethyl dibromomalonate (DB) as an additive to optimize the solvation structure of electrolytes to modify the SEI. Meanwhile, this work groundbreakingly develops DB plasma technology coupled with DB electrolyte additive to construct a combinatorial SEI: inner plasma&#8208;induced SEI layer composed of LiBr and Li2CO3 plus additive&#8208;reduced SEI containing LiBr/Li2CO3/organic lithium compounds as an outer compatible layer. The optimized hybrid SEI has strong affinity toward Li+ and good mechanical properties, thereby inducing horizontal dispersion and uniform deposition of Li+ and keep structure stable. Accordingly, the symmetrical cells exhibit enhanced cycling stability for 1200&#160;h at an overpotential of 23.8&#160;mV with average coulombic efficiency (99.51%). Additionally, the full cells with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode deliver a capacity retention of 81.7% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C, and the pouch cell achieves a volumetric specific energy of &#8776;664&#160;Wh L&#8210;1. This work provides new enlightenment on plasma technology for fabrication of advanced metal anodes for energy storage.

         <title>Advances in Piezoelectret Materials&#8208;Based Bidirectional Haptic Communication Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bidirectional haptic communication devices accelerate the revolution of virtual/augmented reality and flexible/wearable electronics. As an emerging kind of flexible piezoelectric materials, piezoelectret materials can effortlessly convert mechanical force into electrical signals and respond to electrical fields in a deformation manner, exhibiting enormous potential in the construction of bidirectional haptic communication devices. Existing reviews on piezoelectret materials primarily focus on flexible energy harvesters and sensors, and the recent development of piezoelectret&#8208;based bidirectional haptic communication devices has not been comprehensively reviewed. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the materials construction, along with the recent advances in bidirectional haptic communication devices, is provided. First, the development timeline, key characteristics, and various fabrication methods of piezoelectret materials are introduced. Subsequently, following the underlying mechanisms of bidirectional electromechanical signal conversion of piezoelectret, strategies to improve the d33 coefficients of materials are proposed. The principles of haptic perception and feedback are also highlighted, and representative works and progress in this area are summarized. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with improving the overall practicability of piezoelectret materials&#8208;based bidirectional haptic communication devices.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Interferometric Sum&#8208;Frequency Imaging of Strongly Coupled Phonon Polaritons in SiC Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phonon polaritons enable waveguiding and localization of infrared light with extreme confinement and low losses. The spatial propagation and spectral resonances of such polaritons are usually probed with complementary techniques such as near&#8208;field optical microscopy and far&#8208;field reflection spectroscopy. Here, we&#160;introduce infrared&#8208;visible sum&#8208;frequency spectro&#8208;microscopy as a tool for spectroscopic imaging of phonon polaritons. The technique simultaneously provides sub&#8208;wavelength spatial resolution and highly&#8208;resolved spectral resonance information. This is implemented by resonantly exciting polaritons using a tunable infrared laser and wide&#8208;field microscopic detection of the upconverted light. We&#160;employ this technique to image hybridization and strong coupling of localized and propagating surface phonon polaritons in metasurfaces of SiC micropillars. Spectro&#8208;microscopy allows us to measure the polariton dispersion simultaneously in momentum space by angle&#8208;dependent resonance imaging, and in real space by polariton interferometry. Notably, we&#160;directly visualize how strong coupling affects the spatial localization of polaritons, inaccessible with conventional spectroscopic techniques. We&#160;further observe the formation of edge states at excitation frequencies where strong coupling prevents polariton propagation into the metasurface. Our&#160;approach is applicable to the wide range of polaritonic materials with broken inversion symmetry and can be used as a fast and non&#8208;perturbative tool to image polariton hybridization and&#160;propagation.

         <title>Materials Advances in Photocatalytic Solar Hydrogen Production: Integrating Systems and Economics for a Sustainable Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic solar hydrogen generation, including both overall water splitting and organic reforming, presents a promising route for green hydrogen production. To advance the commercialization of this technology, this review offers an integrated, multidisciplinary perspective on photocatalyst and system designs aimed at enhancing solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency, while also considering cost and scalability factors.








Abstract
Photocatalytic solar hydrogen generation, encompassing both overall water splitting and organic reforming, presents a promising avenue for green hydrogen production. This technology holds the potential for reduced capital costs in comparison to competing methods like photovoltaic&#8208;electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, owing to its simplicity and fewer auxiliary components. However, the current solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of photocatalytic solar hydrogen production has predominantly remained low at &#8776;1&#8211;2% or lower, mainly due to curtailed access to the entire solar spectrum, thus impeding practical application of photocatalytic solar hydrogen production. This review offers an integrated, multidisciplinary perspective on photocatalytic solar hydrogen production. Specifically, the review presents the existing approaches in photocatalyst and system designs aimed at significantly boosting the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency, while also considering factors of cost and scalability of each approach. In&#8208;depth discussions extending beyond the efficacy of material and system design strategies are particularly vital to identify potential hurdles in translating photocatalysis research to large&#8208;scale applications. Ultimately, this review aims to provide understanding and perspective of feasible pathways for commercializing photocatalytic solar hydrogen production technology, considering both engineering and economic standpoints.

         <title>Beyond Lipids: Exploring Advances in Polymeric Gene Delivery in the Lipid Nanoparticles Era</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent surge in lipid popularity, driven by approval of lipid nanoparticle vaccines, overshadows polymers as gene delivery vectors. Nonetheless, polymeric systems are advancing in clinical trials, with multiple early&#8208;stage companies actively developing them. This review highlights advances in polymer design for gene delivery via polyplexes and covalent polymer&#8208;nucleic acid conjugates, and briefly covers novel computational techniques for improved design.








Abstract
The recent success of gene therapy during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has underscored the importance of effective and safe delivery systems. Complementing lipid&#8208;based delivery systems, polymers present a promising alternative for gene delivery. Significant advances have been made in the recent past, with multiple clinical trials progressing beyond phase I and several companies actively working on polymeric delivery systems which provides assurance that polymeric carriers can soon achieve clinical translation. The massive advantage of structural tunability and vast chemical space of polymers is being actively leveraged to mitigate shortcomings of traditional polycationic polymers and improve the translatability of delivery systems. Tailored polymeric approaches for diverse nucleic acids and for specific subcellular targets are now being designed to improve therapeutic efficacy. This review describes the recent advances in polymer design for improved gene delivery by polyplexes and covalent polymer&#8208;nucleic acid conjugates. The review also offers a brief note on novel computational techniques for improved polymer design. The review concludes with an overview of the current state of polymeric gene therapies in the clinic as well as future directions on their translation to the clinic.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Array via Liquid Metal Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid metal nanoreactor strategy is proposed for realizing high&#8208;entropy alloy arrays. The coalescence nature endowed by the tendency to decrease surface energy constructed the basis of the nanoreactor to provide a confined reaction environment for the nucleation and growth of multiple elements, thus forming a single particle within each patterned feature.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanostructures arranged into well&#8208;defined configurations hold great potential for accelerating the development of electronics, photonics, catalysis, and device integration. However, the random nucleation induced by the disparity in physicochemical properties of multiple elements makes it challenging to achieve single&#8208;particle synthesis at the patterned preset sites in the high&#8208;entropy scenario. Herein, the liquid metal nanoreactor strategy is proposed to realize the construction of HEA arrays. The coalescence of the liquid metal driven by the tendency to decrease surface energy provides a restricted environment for the nucleation and growth to form single HEA particles at the preset locations, which can be regarded as a self&#8208;confinement reaction. Liquid metal endowing a low diffusion energy barrier on the substrate and a high diffusivity of the alloy system can dynamically promote the aggregation process. As a result, the HEA array is prepared with elements up to eleven and possesses uniform periodicity, which exhibits excellent holography response in a broad spectrum. This work injects new vitality into the construction of HEA nanopatterns and provides an excellent platform for propelling their fundamental research and applications.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Free Hydroxy Groups for Enhanced Perfluorooctanoic Acid Uptake in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a highly recalcitrant organic pollutant, and its bioaccumulation severely endangers human health. While various methods have been developed for PFOA removal, the targeted design of adsorbents with high efficiency and reusability remains largely unexplored. Here we present the rational design and synthesis of two novel zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8210;organic frameworks (MOFs) bearing free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites, namely noninterpenetrated PCN&#8208;1001 and two&#8208;fold interpenetrated PCN&#8208;1002. Single crystal analysis of the pure ligand reveals that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a pivotal role in directing the formation of MOFs with free hydroxy groups. Furthermore, the transformation from PCN&#8208;1001 to PCN&#8208;1002 has been realized. Compared to PCN&#8208;1001, PCN&#8208;1002 displays higher chemical stability due to interpenetration, thereby demonstrating an exceptional PFOA adsorption capacity of up to 632&#160;mg g&#8722;1 (1.53&#160;mmol g&#8722;1), which is comparable to the reported record values. Moreover, PCN&#8208;1002 shows rapid kinetics, high selectivity, and long&#8208;life cycles in PFOA removal tests. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that multiple hydrogen bonds between the free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites and PFOA, along with Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, work collaboratively to enhance PFOA adsorption.

In the recent advances of organic solar cells (OSCs), quinoxaline (Qx)&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (QxNFAs) have attracted lots of attention and enabled the recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 20%. As an excellent electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, Qx possesses advantages of many modifiable sites, wide absorption range, low reorganization energy and so on. To develop promising QxNFAs to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, it is necessary to systematically summarize the QxNFAs reported so far. In this review, all the focused QxNFAs are classified into five categories as following: SM&#8208;Qx, YQx, fused&#8208;YQx, giant&#8208;YQx, and polymer&#8208;Qx according to the molecular skeletons. The molecular design concepts, relationships between the molecular structure and optoelectronic properties, intrinsic mechanisms of device performance are discussed in detail. At the end, we sum up the advantages of this kind of materials, prospect the molecular develop direction, give the challenges faced by QxNFAs and advise constructive solutions to the existing problems. Overall, this review presents unique viewpoints to conquer the challenge of QxNFAs and thus boost OSCs development further toward commercial applications.

         <title>Membrane Fusion&#8208;Mediated Loading of Therapeutic siRNA into Exosome for Tissue&#8208;Specific Application</title>

Abstract
Tissue&#8208;specific delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics beyond the liver remains a key challenge in nucleic acid drug development. To address this issue, exploiting exosomes as a novel carrier has emerged as a promising approach for efficient nucleic acid drug delivery. However, current exosome&#8208;based delivery systems still face multiple hurdles in their clinical applications. Herein, we present a strategy for constructing a hybrid exosome vehicle (HEV) through a DNA zipper&#8208;mediated membrane fusion approach for tissue&#8208;specific siRNA delivery. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we successfully fused a liposome encapsulating anti&#8208;NFKBIZ siRNAs with corneal epithelium cell (CEC)&#8208;derived exosomes to form a HEV construct for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED). With homing characteristics inherited from exosomes, our siRNA&#8208;bearing HEV can target its parent cells and efficiently deliver the siRNA payloads to the cornea. Subsequently, the NFKBIZ gene silencing significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretions from the ocular surface, reshapes its inflammatory microenvironment, and ultimately achieves an excellent therapeutic outcome in a DED mouse model. As a versatile platform, our hybrid exosome with targeting capability and designed therapeutic siRNAs may hold great potential in various disease treatments.

         <title>Turning Waste into Wealth: A Potent Sono&#8208;Immune Strategy Based on Microcystis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has limited therapeutic outcomes and immune responses, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced strategies that can stimulate robust and long&#8208;lasting antitumor effects. Microcystis, a notorious microalga, reveals the possibility of mediating SDT owing to the presence of gas vesicles (GVs) and phycocyanin (PC). Herein, a nontoxic strain of Microcystis elabens (labeled Me) is developed as a novel agent for SDT because it generates O2 under red light illumination, while GVs and PC act as cavitation nuclei and sonosensitizers, respectively. Moreover, algal debris is released after ultrasound irradiation, which primes the Toll&#8208;like receptor pathway to initiate a cascade of immune responses. This sono&#8208;immune strategy inhibits CT26 colon tumor growth largely by promoting dendritic cell maturation and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell activation. After combination with the immune checkpoint blockade, the therapeutic outcome is further amplified, accompanied by satisfactory abscopal and immune memory effects; similar potency is proven in the &#8220;cold&#8221; 4T1 triple&#8208;negative breast tumor. In addition, Me exhibit good biosafety without significant acute or chronic toxicity. Briefly, this study turns waste into wealth by introducing sono&#8208;immunotherapy based on Microcystis that achieved encouraging therapeutic effects on cancer, which is expected to be translated into the clinic.

         <title>Quantifying Asymmetric Zinc Deposition: A Guide Factor for Designing Durable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zinc metal has been recognized as the most promising anode for aqueous energy storage but suffers from severe dendrite growth and poor reversibility. However, the coulombic efficiency (CE) lacks specificity for zinc dendrite growth, particularly in Zn||Zn symmetric cells. Herein, we proposed a novel indicator (fD) based on the characteristic crystallization peaks to evaluate the growth and distribution of zinc dendrites. As a proof of concept, we adopted triethylenetetramine (TETA) as an electrolyte additive to manipulate the zinc flux for uniform deposition, with a corroborating low fD value. A highly durable zinc symmetric cell was achieved, lasting over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 400&#160;h at a large discharge of depth (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 10 mAh cm&#8722;2). Supported by the low fD value, the Zn||TETA&#8208;ZnSO4||MnO2 batteries overcame the sudden short circuit and fast capacity fading. The study provides a feasible method to evaluate zinc dendrites and sheds light on the design of highly reversible zinc anodes.

         <title>Calcium Hexacyanoferrate Nanozyme Enhances Plant Stress Resistance by Oxidative Stress Alleviation and Heavy Metal Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;platform with enzyme&#8208;mimic activities and ion&#8208;exchange capabilities is used to exert the ability of mimicking six natural enzymes to remove excess reactive oxygen species and heavy metal ions in the environment, providing new opportunities for improving plant antioxidant capacity to enhance stress resistance.








Abstract
Oxidative damage, exacerbated by the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), profoundly inhibits both crop growth and yield. Herein, a biocompatible nanozyme, calcium hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (CaHCF NPs), targeting ROS is developed, to mitigate oxidative damage and sequestrate heavy metal ions during plant growth. Uniquely, CaHCF NPs feature multifaced enzyme&#8208;like activities, involving superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase, thiol peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase, which enable them to neutralize excessive ROS. Furthermore, CaHCF NPs promote calcium&#8208;cadmium exchange process, diminishing the uptake of heavy metals. Importantly, 120&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1 of CaHCF NPs alleviate the inhibitory effects of hydrogen peroxide and cadmium chloride on Arabidopsis and tomato.&#160;The activities of SOD, POD, and CAT increase by 46.2%, 74.4%, and 48.3%, respectively, meanwhile the glutathione level rises by 72.4% in Arabidopsis under cadmium stress. Moreover, CaHCF NPs boost the expression of genes associated with antioxidation, heavy metal detoxification, nutrient transport, and stress resistance. These findings unveil the significant potential of nanoplatforms equipped with nanozymes in alleviating oxidative stress in plants, which not only regulate crop growth but also substantially ameliorate yield and quality, heralding a new era in agricultural nanotechnology.

         <title>Superconductivity in Freestanding Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelate Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity. This work offers a new versatile platform for investigating superconductivity in nickelates, such as the pairing symmetry via constructing Josephson tunneling junctions and higher Tc values via high&#8208;pressure experiments.








Abstract
The observation of superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates has attracted significant attention due to its potential as a new platform for exploring high&#8208;Tc superconductivity. However, thus far, superconductivity has only been observed in epitaxial thin films, which limits the manipulation capabilities and modulation methods compared to two&#8208;dimensional exfoliated materials. Given the exceptionally giant strain tunability and stacking capability of freestanding membranes, separating superconducting nickelates from the as&#8208;grown substrate is a novel way to engineer the superconductivity and uncover the underlying physics. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\ \mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity. This work offers a new versatile platform for investigating superconductivity in nickelates, such as the pairing symmetry via constructing Josephson tunneling junctions and higher Tc values via high&#8208;pressure experiments.

&lt;p&gt;The observation of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has attracted significant attention due to its potential as a new platform for exploring high-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductivity. However, thus far, superconductivity has only been observed in epitaxial thin films, which limits the manipulation capabilities and modulation methods compared to two-dimensional exfoliated materials. Given the exceptionally giant strain tunability and stacking capability of freestanding membranes, separating superconducting nickelates from the as-grown substrate is a novel way to engineer the superconductivity and uncover the underlying physics. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;NiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\ \mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity. This work offers a new versatile platform for investigating superconductivity in nickelates, such as the pairing symmetry via constructing Josephson tunneling junctions and higher &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; values via high-pressure experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Moir&#233; Engineering of Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque by Twisted WS2 Homobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant improvements and enhanced gate&#8208;voltage tunability of spin&#8211;orbit torque are achieved in CoFe/Pt films interfaced with WS2/WS2 moir&#233; superlattices. The findings are attributed to the moir&#233; magnetic field&#8208;modulated absorption of spin&#8208;Hall current from Pt through the magnetic proximity effect. This study highlights the potential of moir&#233; physics as a novel building block for the design of advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Artificial moir&#233; superlattices created by stacking 2D crystals have emerged as a powerful platform with unprecedented material&#8208;engineering capabilities. While moir&#233; superlattices are reported to host a number of novel quantum states, their potential for spintronic applications remains largely unexplored. Here, the effective manipulation of spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) is demonstrated using moir&#233; superlattices in ferromagnetic devices comprised of twisted WS2/WS2 homobilayer (t&#8208;WS2) and CoFe/Pt thin films by altering twisting angle (&#952;) and gate voltage. Notably, a substantial enhancement of up to 44.5% is observed in SOT conductivity at &#952;&#160;&#8776;&#160;8.3&#176;. Furthermore, compared to the WS2 monolayer and untwisted WS2/WS2 bilayers, the moir&#233; superlattices in t&#8208;WS2 enable a greater gate&#8208;voltage tunability of SOT conductivity. These results are related to the generation of the interfacial moir&#233; magnetic field by the real&#8208;space Berry phase in moir&#233; superlattices, which modulates the absorption of the spin&#8208;Hall current arising from Pt through the magnetic proximity effect. This study highlights the moir&#233; physics as a new building block for designing enhanced spintronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Reconfiguration Induced Multifunctional Triple&#8208;Gradient Artificial Interfacial Layer toward Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is demonstrated to induce triple&#8208;gradient (PDDA&#8208;TFSI)&#8208;Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O&#8208;Sn (PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn) artificial interface on the Zn anode surface. The triple&#8208;gradient interface consists of the top layer PT with cation confinement and H2O inhibition, the dense interlayer ZHC with Zn2+ conduction and electron shielding, and the bottom Znophilic layer Sn. The resulting PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn@Zn symmetric cell achieves an ultra&#8208;long lifetime over 6500&#160;h.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries&#160;featuring with intrinsic safety and low cost are highly desirable for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but the unstable Zn&#8208;metal anode resulting from uncontrollable dendrite growth and grievous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) shortens their cycle life. Herein, a feasible in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is developed to generate triple&#8208;gradient poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PDDA&#8208;TFSI)&#8208;Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O&#8208;Sn (PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn) artificial layer. The resulting triple&#8208;gradient interface consists of the spherical top layer PT with cation confinement and H2O inhibition, the dense intermediate layer ZHC nanosheet with Zn2+ conduction and electron shielding, and the bottom layer Znophilic Sn metal. The well&#8208;designed triple&#8208;gradient artificial interfacial layer synergistically facilitates rapid Zn2+ diffusion to regulate uniform Zn deposition and accelerates the desolvation process while suppressing HER. Consequently, the PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn@Zn symmetric cell achieves an ultralong lifespan over 6500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a full battery coupling with MnO2 cathode exhibits a 17.2% increase in capacity retention compared with bare Zn anode after 1000 cycles. The in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is also applied to prepare triple&#8208;gradient PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;In, and the assembled Zn//Cu cell operates steadily for over 8400&#160;h while maintaining Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. This work paves the way to designing multicomponent gradient interface for stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Dark Current In Broadband Perovskite&#8208;Organic Heterojunction Photodetectors Controlled by Interfacial Energy Band Offset</title>

Abstract
Lead halide perovskite and organic semiconductors are promising classes of materials for photodetector (PD) applications. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite PDs have performance metrics exceeding silicon PDs in the visible. While organic semiconductors offer bandgap tunability due to their chemical design, with detection extended into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR), perovskites are limited to the visible band and the first fraction of NIR spectrum. In this work, we design perovskite&#8208;organic heterojunction (POH) PDs with absorption up to 950 nm by the dual contribution of perovskite and the donor:acceptor bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ), without any intermediate layer. We systematically study the effect of the energetics of the donor materials on the dark current (Jd) of the device by using the PBDB&#8208;T polymer family (PCE12, PM6 and PM7). By combining our experimental results with drift&#8208;diffusion simulations, we show that Jd in POH devices is limited by thermal generation via deep trap states in the BHJ layer. Thus, we obtain the best performance for the PM7&#8208;based POH, which delivers an ultra&#8208;low noise current of 2&#215;10&#8722;14 A Hz&#8722;1/2 and a high specific detectivity of 4.7&#215;1012 Jones in the NIR. Lastly, we demonstrate the application of our PM7&#8208;based POH devices as NIR pulse oximeter with high&#8208;accuracy heartbeat monitoring at long&#8208;distance of 2 meters.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Design of Triple&#8208;Targeted Protein Nanoprobes for Multiplexed Imaging of Cancer Lymphatic Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Targeted imaging of cancer lymphatic metastasis remains challenging due to its highly heterogeneous molecular and phenotypic diversity. Herein, we introduced triple&#8208;targeted protein nanoprobes capable of specifically binding to three targets for imaging cancer lymphatic metastasis, through a data&#8208;driven design approach combined with a synthetic biology&#8208;based assembly strategy. Specifically, to address the diversity of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), a combination of three targets, including C&#8208;X&#8208;C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), transferrin receptor protein 1 (TfR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) was identified, leveraging machine leaning&#8208;based bioinformatics analysis and examination of lymphatic metastatic tissues from patients with gastric cancer. Using this identified target combination, ferritin nanocage&#8208;based nanoprobes capable of specifically binding to all three targets were designed through the self&#8208;assembly of genetically engineered ferritin subunits using a synthetic biology approach. Multiplexed imaging of heterogeneous metastatic LNs using these nanoprobes resulted in approximately 80% binding with heterogeneous tumor cells, which was 60% higher than that of single&#8208;targeted nanoprobes in a polyclonal lymphatic metastasis animal model. In 19 freshly resected human gastric specimens, the signal from the triple&#8208;targeted nanoprobes significantly differentiated metastatic LNs from benign LNs, in high accordance with pathological examination. This study not only provides an effective nanoprobe for imaging highly heterogeneous lymphatic metastasis but also proposes a potential strategy for guiding the design of targeted nanomedicines for cancer lymphatic metastasis.

         <title>A Thermo&#8208;Responsive MOFs for X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy toward designing thermo&#8208;responsive scintillators based on lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) is developed through integrating various radio&#8208;luminescent functional building units and utilizing the energy transfer reasonably. The resulting ratiometric X&#8208;ray excited luminescent thermometer with the self&#8208;calibration function, high sensitivity, excellent luminescence stability, and visible temperature response, is reported for the first time.








Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive smart materials have aroused extensive interest due to the particular significance of temperature sensing. Although various photoluminescent materials are explored in thermal detection, it is not applicable enough in X&#8208;ray radiation environment where the accuracy and reliability will be influenced. Here, a strategy is proposed by introducing the concept of radio&#8208;luminescent functional building units (RBUs) to construct thermo&#8208;responsive lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) scintillators for self&#8208;calibrating thermometry. The rational designs of RBUs (including organic ligand and Tb3+/Eu3+) with appropriate energy levels lead to high&#8208;performance radio&#8208;luminescence. Ln&#8208;MOFs scintillators exhibit perfect linear response to X&#8208;ray, presenting low dose rate detection limit (min &#8776;156.1 nGyairs&#8208;1). Self&#8208;calibrating detection based on ratiometric XEL intensities is achieved with good absolute and relative sensitivities of 6.74 and 8.1%K&#8208;1, respectively. High relative light yield (max &#8776;39000 photons MeV&#8722;1), imaging spatial resolution (max &#8776;18 lp&#160;mm&#8208;1), irradiation stability (intensity &#8776;100% at 368 K in total dose up to 215 Gyair), and giant color transformation visualization benefit the applications, especially the in situ thermo&#8208;responsive X&#8208;ray imaging. Such strategy provides a promising way to develop the novel smart photonic materials with excellent scintillator performances.

         <title>Invoking Interfacial Engineering Boosts Structural Stability Empowering Exceptional Cyclability of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The Se&#8208;NCM811//FeSe2//Fe2O3 self&#8208;assembled electric field activates and improves interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, Se2&#8722; selectively adsorbs within oxygen vacancies to form O&#9472;TM&#9472;Se bonds, while FeSe2 reacts with oxygen to form Fe2O3 and SeO2. The Fe2O3 coating mitigates hydrofluoric acid erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen and suppressing structural distortion.








Abstract
The cycling stability of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 under high voltages is hindered by the occurrence of hybrid anion&#8208; and cation&#8208;redox processes, leading to oxygen escape and uncontrolled phase collapse. In this study, an interfacial engineering strategy involving a straightforward mechanical ball milling and low&#8208;temperature calcination, employing a Se&#8208;doped and FeSe2&amp;Fe2O3&#8208;modified approach is proposed to design a stable Ni&#8208;rich cathode. Se2&#8722; are selectively adsorbed within oxygen vacancies to form O&#9472;TM&#9472;Se bond, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen, and preventing structural distortion. Simultaneously, the Se&#8208;NCM811//FeSe2//Fe2O3 self&#8208;assembled electric field is activated, improving interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, FeSe2 accelerates Li+ diffusion and reacts with oxygen to form Fe2O3 and SeO2. The Fe2O3 coating mitigates hydrofluoric acid erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, limiting the outward migration of oxygen anions. Impressively, the modified materials exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 79.7% after 500 cycles at 1C under 4.5&#160;V. Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 94.6% in 3&#8211;4.25&#160;V after 550 cycles in pouch&#8208;type full battery. This dual&#8208;modification approach demonstrates its feasibility and opens new perspective for the development of stable lithium&#8208;ion batteries operating at high voltages.

         <title>Discovering Pyramidal Treasures: Multi&#8208;Scale Design of High Strength&#8211;Ductility Titanium Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strength&#8208;ductility synergy of (&#945; + &#946;) titanium alloys is often limited by the hexagonal close&#8208;packed structure of the &#945;&#8208;phase. This work shows a facile route to a bimodal (&#945;+&#946;) titanium alloy with gigapascal&#8208;level strength and &gt;20 % tensile ductility via integrated lattice&#8208;scale and polycrystal&#8208;scale design conceptions. 








Abstract
Mechanical properties of titanium alloys, one of humankind's most essential structural materials, suffer from the lack of &#12296;c + a&#12297; dislocations on pyramidal slip planes, failing homogeneous plastic strain accommodation. This mechanical treasure is not easily accessible in titanium alloys because of the required excessively high stress levels. The present work demonstrates that such a dilemma may be overcome by meticulously tuning the c/a ratio, the simplest crystallographic parameter of the hexagonal close&#8208;packed lattice, through Sn alloying. Combining this lattice&#8208;scale design concept with a cross&#8208;rolling based polycrystal&#8208;scale design solution, this study showcases a facile route to bimodal (&#945; + &#946;) titanium alloys with exceptional strength&#8211;ductility synergy.

         <title>Improved Hole&#8208;Selective Contact Enables Highly Efficient and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Semitransparent Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) of iodine&#8208;equipped&#8208;2PACz (I&#8208;2PACz) is employed to achieve high&#8208;performance FAPbBr3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The I&#8208;2PACz as the hole&#8208;selective contact can improve the perovskite crystallization through halogen&#8208;halogen bond, and optimize the interfacial energy levels alignment to facilitate hole extraction. A record efficiency of 11.14% for FAPbBr3&#8208;based solar cells and 6.23% for semitransparent modules are achieved.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as the hole&#8208;selective contact have achieved remarkable success in iodine&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while their impact on bromine&#8208;based PSCs is limited due to the poor perovskite crystallization behavior and mismatched energy level alignment. Here, a highly efficient SAM of (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diiodo&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (I&#8208;2PACz) is employed to address these challenges in FAPbBr3&#8208;based PSCs. The incorporation of I atoms into I&#8208;2PACz not only releases tensile stress within FAPbBr3 perovskite, promoting oriented crystallization and minimizing defects through halogen&#8208;halogen bond, but also optimizes the energy levels alignment at hole&#8208;selective interface for enhanced hole extraction. Ultimately, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.14% is achieved, which stands among the highest reported value for FAPbBr3 PSCs. Furthermore, the semitransparent devices/modules exhibit impressive PCEs of 8.19% and 6.23% with average visible transmittance of 41.98% and 38.99%. Remarkably, after operating at maximum power point for 1000 h, the encapsulated device maintains 93% of its initial PCE. These results demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance bromine&#8208;based PSCs toward further applications.

         <title>Unconventional Dually&#8208;Mobile Superrepellent Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional dually&#8208;mobile superrepellent surfaces are designed by combining rationally controlled surface textures and liquid&#8208;like surface chemistry, enabling droplets to keep highly mobile in both the Cassie and the Wenzel states. A theoretical model is established to explain the significantly reduced adhesion of Wenzel&#8208;state droplets, which aligns closely with the experimental findings.








Abstract
The ability of water droplets to move freely on superrepellent surfaces is a crucial feature that enables effective liquid repellency. Common superrepellent surfaces allow free motion of droplets in the Cassie state, with the liquid resting on the surface textures. However, liquid impalement into the textures generally leads to a wetting transition to the Wenzel state and droplet immobilization on the surface, thereby destroying the liquid repellency. This study reports the creation of a novel type of superrepellent surface through rational structural control combined with liquid&#8208;like surface chemistry, which allows for the free movement of water droplets and effective repellency in both the Cassie and Wenzel states. Theoretical guidelines for designing such surfaces are provided, and experimental results are consistent with theoretical analysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the enhanced ice resistance of the dually&#8208;mobile superrepellent surfaces, along with their distinctive self&#8208;cleaning capability to eliminate internal contaminants. This study expands the understanding of superrepellency and offers new possibilities for the development of repellent surfaces with exceptional anti&#8208;wetting properties.

         <title>Highly Reversible Positive&#8208;Valence Conversion of Sulfur Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly reversible S2&#8208;/S4+ redox behavior with up to six&#8208;electron transfer is achieved in zinc batteries based on the highly concentrated ClO4&#8722;&#8208;containing eutectic electrolyte, which can stabilize the positive&#8208;valence S compound. Notably, the achieved conversion process demonstrates the highest operation voltage achieved to date in Zn&#8214;S batteries and delivered remarkable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Sulfur is a promising conversion&#8208;type cathode for zinc batteries (ZBs) due to its high discharge capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the redox conversion of multivalent S in ZBs is still limited, only having achieved S0/S2&#8722; redox conversion with low discharge voltage and poor reversibility. This study presents significant progress by demonstrating, for the first time, the reversible S2&#8722;/S4+ redox behavior in ZBs with up to six&#8208;electron transfer (with an achieved discharge capacity of &#8776;1284 mAh g&#8722;1) using a highly concentrated ClO4&#8722;&#8208;containing electrolyte. The developed succinonitrile&#8211;Zn(ClO4)2 eutectic electrolyte stabilizes the positive&#8208;valence S compound and contributes to an ultra&#8208;low polarization voltage. Notably, the achieved flat discharge plateaus demonstrate the highest operation voltage (1.54&#160;V) achieved to date in Zn&#8214;S batteries. Furthermore, the high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8214;S battery exhibits remarkable conversion dynamics, excellent cycling performance (85.7% capacity retention after 500 cycles), high efficiency (98.4%), and energy density (527&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#160;S&#8722;1). This strategy of positive&#8208;valence conversion of sulfur represents a significant advancement in understanding sulfur chemistry in batteries and holds promise for future high&#8208;voltage sulfur&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Wearable Aptalyzer Integrates Microneedle and Electrochemical Sensing for In Vivo Monitoring of Glucose and Lactate in Live Animals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Wearable Aptalyzer enables real&#8208;time, minimally invasive monitoring of glucose and lactate. With effective skin penetration and integration into functionalized electrodes, it offers high sensitivity for clinical detection of these biomarkers. Demonstrated in mouse and rat models, the Wearable Aptalyzer shows stable signals and extended lactate monitoring, indicating its potential for personalized diabetes care.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of clinically relevant biomarkers within the interstitial fluid (ISF) using microneedle (MN)&#8208;based assays, has the potential to transform healthcare. This study introduces the Wearable Aptalyzer, an integrated system fabricated by combining biocompatible hydrogel MN arrays for ISF extraction with an electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor for in situ monitoring of blood analytes. The use of aptamers enables continuous monitoring of a wide range of analytes, beyond what is possible with enzymatic monitoring. The Wearable Aptalyzer is used for real&#8208;time and multiplexed monitoring of glucose and lactate in ISF. Validation experiments using live mice and rat models of type 1 diabetes demonstrate strong correlation between the measurements collected from the Wearable Aptalyzer in ISF and those obtained from gold&#8208;standard techniques for blood glucose and lactate, for each analyte alone and in combination. The Wearable Aptalyzer effectively addresses the limitations inherent in enzymatic detection methods as well as solid MN biosensors and the need for reliable and multiplexed bioanalytical monitoring in vivo.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Mediated Spiking Chemical Neuron based on Mott Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial spiking neurons capable of interpretating ionic information into electrical spikes are critical to mimic the biological signaling systems. Mott memristors are attractive for constructing artificial spiking neurons due to their simple structure, low energy consumption, and rich neural dynamics. However, challenges remain in achieving ion&#8208;mediated spiking and biohybrid&#8208;interfacing in Mott neurons. Here, we introduce a biomimetic spiking chemical neuron (SCN) utilizing an NbOx Mott memristor and oxide field&#8208;effect transistor (FET)&#8208;type chemical sensor The SCN exhibits both excitation and inhibition spiking behaviors toward ionic concentrations akin to biological neural systems. It demonstrates spiking responses across physiological and pathological Na+ concentrations (1&#8211;200&#160;mM). The Na+&#8208;mediated SCN enables both frequency encoding and time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike (TTFS) coding schemes, illustrating the rich neural dynamics of Mott neuron. Additionally, the SCN interfaced with L929 cells facilitates real&#8208;time modulation of ion&#8208;mediated spiking under both normal and salty cellular microenvironments.

         <title>Fabrication of Isotope&#8208;Enriched Nanostructures using Ultrafast Laser Pulses under Ambient Conditions for Biomolecular Sensing</title>

Abstract
Recent advances in the use of stable isotopes necessitate novel synthesis techniques for isotope separation and enrichment that are scalable and offer high throughput. Stable&#8208;isotope&#8208;enriched nanostructures can offer unique advantages as nanomedicines, safe tracers, and labels and are critical for applications in various industrial processes, metabolic research, and medicine. So far, there exists no method to synthesize miniature isotope&#8208;enriched materials at the nanoscale. In this study, we put forward an ultrafast Laser&#8208;induced isotope enrichment at nanoscale (LIIEN) to synthesize isotope&#8208;enriched nanostructures, eliminating the need for large equipment and expenses, thereby demonstrating a lab&#8208;scale isotope enrichment process. We observed a significant isotope enrichment for Carbon nanostructures. The isotope enrichment can be attributed to the redistribution of isotope ions in the plasma plume explained by the plasma centrifuge model. The LIIEN synthesized structures exhibited excellent SERS signal enhancement and reproducibility, making them potential candidates for SERS&#8208;based biomolecule sensing. This technique is an efficient method to fabricate nanosized isotope&#8208;enriched structures of characteristic properties by carefully tuning laser parameters at ambient conditions.

Abstract
The diabetic wound healing is challenging due to the sabotaged delicate balance of immune regulation via an undetermined pathophysiological mechanism, so it is crucial to decipher multicellular signatures underlying diabetic wound healing and seek therapeutic strategies. Here, we develop a strategy using novel trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide (TMAO)&#8208;derived zwitterionic hydrogel to promote diabetic wound healing, and explore the multi&#8208;cellular ecosystem around zwitterionic hydrogel, mapping out an overview of different cells in the zwitterionic microenvironment by single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing. The diverse cellular heterogeneity has been revealed, highlighting the critical role of macrophage and neutrophils in managing diabetic wound healing. It is found that polyzwitterionic hydrogel can upregulate Ccl3+ macrophages and downregulate S100a9+ neutrophils and facilitate their interactions compared with polyanionic and polycationic hydrogels, validating the underlying effect of zwitterionic microenvironment on the activation of adaptive immune system. Moreover, zwitterionic hydrogel inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and promotes angiogenesis, thus improving diabetic wound healing. These findings expand our horizons of the sophisticated orchestration of immune systems in zwitterion&#8208;directed diabetic wound repair and uncover new strategies of novel immunoregulatory biomaterials.

         <title>Nitric Oxide&#8208;Activated Bioorthogonal Co&#8208;delivery Nanoassembly for In Situ Synthesis of Photothermal Agent for Precise and Safe Anti&#8208;cancer Treatment</title>

Abstract
The development of bioorthogonal activation in drug release represents a promising avenue for precise and safe anti&#8208;cancer treatment. However, two significant limitations currently hinder their clinical application: i) the necessity for separate administration of the drug precursor and its corresponding activator, leading to poor drug accumulation and potential side effects; ii) the reliance on exogenous metal or organic activators for triggering bioorthogonal activation, which often exhibit low efficiency and systemic toxicity when extending to living animals. To overcome these limitations, we developed a nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal co&#8208;delivery nanoassembly, termed TTB&#8208;NH2@PArg, which comprises a precursor molecular (TTB&#8208;NH2) and amphipathic polyarginine (PArg). In TTB&#8208;NH2@PArg, PArg serves as both self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;carrier for TTB&#8208;NH2 and a NO generator. In tumor microenvironment (TME), the TME&#8208;specific generation of NO acts as a gas activator, triggering in situ bioorthogonal bond formation that transforms TTB&#8208;NH2 into TTB&#8208;AZO. This tumor&#8208;specific generation of TTB&#8208;AZO not only serves as a potential photothermal agent for effective tumor inhibition but also induces fluorescence change that enables real&#8208;time monitoring of bioorthogonal activation. This study presents a drug co&#8208;delivery approach that enables precise and safe control of bioorthogonal activation for anti&#8208;cancer treatment, improving cancer therapy efficacy while minimizing side effects.

         <title>Manipulation of Cooper&#8208;Pair Tunneling via Domain Structure in a van der Waals Ferromagnetic Josephson Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferromagnetic Josephson junctions play a key role in understanding the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in condensed matter physics. The magnetic domain structures of the ferromagnet in such junctions can significantly affect the tunneling of the superconducting Cooper pairs due to the strong interactions between Cooper pairs and local magnetic moments in the ferromagnetic tunnel barrier. However, the underlying microscopic mechanism of relevant quasiparticle tunneling processes with magnetic domain structures remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the manipulation of Cooper&#8208;pair tunneling in the NbSe2/Cr2Ge2Te6/NbSe2 ferromagnetic Josephson junction by utilizing a multi&#8208;domain ferromagnetic barrier with anisotropic magnetic moments. The evolution of up&#8208;, down&#8208;magnetized domain and Bloch domain structures in Cr2Ge2Te6 barrier under external magnetic fields leads to the enhancement of the critical tunneling supercurrent and an unconventional dual&#8208;peak feature with two local maxima in the field&#8208;dependent critical current curve. The phenomenon of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;modulated critical tunneling supercurrent can be well explained by the competition between the coherence length of tunneling Cooper pairs and the size of magnetic domain walls in Cr2Ge2Te6 barrier. This kind of ferromagnetic Josephson junction provides an intriguing material system for manipulating Cooper&#8208;pair tunneling by tuning the local magnetic moments within magnetic Josephson junction devices.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Large&#8208;area Monolayers and van der Waals Heterostructures of Transition&#8208;metal Chalcogenides via Assisted Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides include some of the most important and ubiquitous families of 2D materials. They host an exceptional variety of electronic and collective states, which can in principle be readily tuned by combining different compounds in van der Waals heterostructures. Achieving this, however, presents a significant materials challenge. The highest quality heterostructures are usually fabricated by stacking layers exfoliated from bulk crystals, which &#8211; while producing excellent prototype devices &#8211; is time consuming, cannot be easily scaled, and can lead to significant complications for materials stability and contamination. Growth via the ultra&#8208;high vacuum deposition technique of molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy (MBE) should be a premier route for 2D heterostructure fabrication, but efforts to achieve this have been complicated by non&#8208;uniform layer coverage, unfavourable growth morphologies, and the presence of significant rotational disorder of the grown epilayer. This work demonstrates a dramatic enhancement in the quality of MBE grown 2D materials by exploiting simultaneous deposition of a sacrificial species from an electron&#8208;beam evaporator during the growth. This approach dramatically enhances the nucleation of the desired epi&#8208;layer, in turn enabling the synthesis of large&#8208;area, uniform monolayers with enhanced quasiparticle lifetimes, and facilitating the growth of epitaxial van der Waals&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity towards NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here we present a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. We achieve a high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Conductive and Patternable 40&#160;nm&#8208;Thick Polymer Film for Reliable Emotion Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (40&#160;nm) polymer film comprising photolithographic poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) and graphene (PLPG) is developed as a patternable and compliant bioelectrode. Finite element analysis is adopted to optimize electrode structure for better stress dissipation ability. PLPG demonstrates excellent performance in motion artifact&#8208;less electrophysiological sensing. Integrating facial electromyogram with machine learning algorithms, a high emotion recognition accuracy is achieved.








Abstract
Understanding psychology is an important task in modern society which helps predict human behavior and provide feedback accordingly. Monitoring of weak psychological and emotional changes requires bioelectronic devices to be stretchable and compliant for unobtrusive and high&#8208;fidelity signal acquisition. Thin conductive polymer film is regarded as an ideal interface; however, it is very challenging to simultaneously balance mechanical robustness and opto&#8208;electrical property. Here, a 40&#160;nm&#8208;thick film based on photolithographic double&#8208;network conductive polymer mediated by graphene layer is reported, which concurrently enables stretchability, conductivity, and conformability.

&lt;p&gt;An ultrathin (40&#160;nm) polymer film comprising photolithographic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) and graphene (PLPG) is developed as a patternable and compliant bioelectrode. Finite element analysis is adopted to optimize electrode structure for better stress dissipation ability. PLPG demonstrates excellent performance in motion artifact-less electrophysiological sensing. Integrating facial electromyogram with machine learning algorithms, a high emotion recognition accuracy is achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding psychology is an important task in modern society which helps predict human behavior and provide feedback accordingly. Monitoring of weak psychological and emotional changes requires bioelectronic devices to be stretchable and compliant for unobtrusive and high-fidelity signal acquisition. Thin conductive polymer film is regarded as an ideal interface; however, it is very challenging to simultaneously balance mechanical robustness and opto-electrical property. Here, a 40&#160;nm-thick film based on photolithographic double-network conductive polymer mediated by graphene layer is reported, which concurrently enables stretchability, conductivity, and conformability. Photolithographic polymer and graphene endow the film photopatternability, enhance stress dissipation capability, as well as improve opto-electrical conductivity (4458 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@&amp;gt;90% transparency) through molecular rearrangement by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bonding. The film is further applied onto corrugated facial skin, the subtle electromyogram is monitored, and machine learning algorithm is performed to understand complex emotions, indicating the outstanding ability for stretchable and compliant bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perspectives on the Practicability of Li&#8208;Rich NMC Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective presents how the practicability of Li&#8208;rich NMCs is limited by issues like tap density, electrolytes, gas generation, voltage hysteresis, and decay. A techno&#8208;economic analysis is also provided to show that Li&#8208;rich NMCs have material cost highly dependent on lithium price, but still preserve the dominance of lower pack cost than other cathode candidates.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich NMCs layered oxides, with the general formula of Li[LixNiyMnzCo1&#8722;x&#8722;y&#8722;z]O2, are known for their exceptionally high capacities but remain yet to be practicalized in the real world. They have attracted enormous research attention due to their complex structure and intriguing redox mechanisms, with a particular focus on anionic redox over the past decade. While fundamental understandings are fruitful, the practical considerations are emphasized here by providing perspectives on how Li&#8208;rich NMCs are limited by practical roadblocks and guidelines on how to cope with these limitations. It is also demonstrated that, via a techno&#8208;economic analysis, Li&#8208;rich NMCs have material cost ($/kg) highly dependent on the lithium price, but still preserve the dominance of lower pack cost ($/kWh) than other cathode candidates principally owing to their larger material energy densities. In addition to their pure application in electric&#8208;vehicle batteries, using them as &#8220;electrode additive&#8221; or &#8220;sacrificial agent&#8221; can further multiply their practicalities in assortment of scenarios, which is further discussed.

         <title>Hexacarbazolylbenzene: An Excellent Host Molecule Causing Strong Guest Molecular Orientation and the High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils great potential of hexacarbazolylbenzene (6CzPh) as host material in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). This host material leads to complete horizontal molecular orientations (&#920;h = 100%, S = &#8722;0.50) of 4CzIPN, and the device realizes high efficiency with a long device lifetime.








Abstract
Hexacarbazolylbenzene (6CzPh), which is benzene substituted by six carbazole rings, is a simple and attractive compound. Despite the success of a wide variety of carbazole derivatives in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), 6CzPh has not received attention so far. Here, excellent performances of 6CzPh are revealed as a host material in OLEDs regarding conventional host materials. Various strategies are implemented to improve the performance of OLEDs, e.g., triplet utilization by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence emitters for maximizing internal quantum efficiency, and molecular orientation control for increasing outcoupling efficiency. The present host material is suited for both criteria. Robustness of the structure and sufficiently high triplet energy enables a high external quantum efficiency with a long device lifetime. Besides, the host material boosts the horizontal molecular orientations of several guest emitters. It is noteworthy that disk&#8208;shaped 4CzIPN marks the complete horizontal molecular orientations (&#920;h = 100%, S = &#8722;0.50). These results provide an effective way of improving efficiencies without sacrificing device durability for future OLEDs.

         <title>Accelerating the Rate&#8208;Determining Steps of Sulfur Conversion Reaction for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Working at an Ultrawide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous bismuth vanadate spheres have been used as sulfur host material, which achieve the rapid snap&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalytic process by shortening lithium&#8208;ion transport pathway and targeted accelerating rate&#8208;determining steps. Such the promoting effect greatly inhibits severe &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; at high temperatures and improves sulfur conversion efficiency in the cryogenic environment.








Abstract
Wide operation temperature is the crucial objective for an energy storage system that can be applied under harsh environmental conditions. For lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfide intermediates will aggravate with the temperature increasing, while the reaction kinetics decreases sharply as the temperature decreasing. In particular, sulfur reaction mechanism at low temperatures seems to be quite different from that at room temperature. Here, through in situ Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies, the newly emerged platform at cryogenic temperature corresponds to the reduction process of Li2S8 to Li2S4, which will be another rate&#8208;determining step of sulfur conversion reaction, in addition to the solid&#8208;phase conversion process of Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S at low temperatures. Porous bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) spheres are designed as sulfur host material, which achieve the rapid snap&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalytic process by shortening lithium&#8208;ion transport pathway and accelerating the targeted rate&#8208;determining steps. Such promoting effect greatly inhibits severe &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; at high temperatures and simultaneously improves sulfur conversion efficiency in the cryogenic environment. The cell with the porous BiVO4 spheres as the host exhibits excellent rate capability and cycle performance under wide working temperatures.

         <title>Innovative Formulation Platform: Paving the Way for Superior Protein Therapeutics with Enhanced Efficacy and Broadened Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein therapeutics hold great promise for treating various diseases, yet their delivery remains challenging. This review introduces &#8220;Pcapsulation,&#8221; a protein formulation technology. Specifically, this review details the material design and summarizes the applications of formulated proteins across metabolic disorders, cancer, infectious diseases, and nervous system diseases. Perspectives on the future directions of protein delivery are also discussed.








Abstract
Protein therapeutics offer high therapeutic potency and specificity; the broader adoptions and development of protein therapeutics, however, have been constricted by their intrinsic limitations such as inadequate stability, immunogenicity, suboptimal pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and off&#8208;target effects. This review describes a platform technology that formulates individual protein molecules with a thin formulation layer of crosslinked polymers, which confers the protein therapeutics with high activity, enhanced stability, controlled release capability, reduced immunogenicity, improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and ability to cross the blood brain barriers. Based on currently approved protein therapeutics, this formulating platform affords the development of a vast family of superior protein therapeutics with improved efficacy and broadened indications at significantly reduced cost.

In a strongly acidic medium (pH&#160;=&#160;1), the single&#8208;atom Zn sites with Zn&#8208;N4 coordination exhibits nearly 100% FECO in a wide current density range of 100&#8211;600&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Clarifying the formation mechanism of single&#8208;atom sites guides the design of emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and facilitates the identification of the active sites at atomic scale. Herein, a molten&#8208;salt atomization strategy is developed for synthesizing zinc (Zn) SACs with temperature universality from 400 to 1000/1100&#160;&#176;C and an evolved coordination from Zn&#8208;N2Cl2 to Zn&#8208;N4. The electrochemical tests and in situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirm that the Zn&#8208;N4 atomic sites are active for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to carbon monoxide (CO). In a strongly acidic medium (0.2&#160;m K2SO4, pH = 1), the Zn SAC formed at 1000&#160;&#176;C (Zn1NC) containing Zn&#8208;N4 sites enables highly selective CO2 electroreduction to CO, with nearly 100% selectivity toward CO product in a wide current density range of 100&#8211;600&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. During a 50 h continuous electrolysis at the industrial current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, Zn1NC achieves Faradaic efficiencies greater than 95% for CO product. The work presents a temperature&#8208;universal formation of single&#8208;atom sites, which provides a novel platform for unraveling the active sites in Zn SACs for CO2 electroreduction and extends the synthesis of SACs with controllable coordination sites.

         <title>Porous Polypyrrolidines for Highly Efficient Recovery of Precious Metals through Reductive Adsorption Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly porous poly&#8208;pyrrolidines (e.g. BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;17) with isolated alkene linkers can recover precious metal ions such as Au3+ very efficiently. The high adsorption capacity toward Au3+ exceeds the theoretical values, as a reductive adsorption mechanism works through the synergistic interplay of redox&#8208;active N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;pyrrolidine subunit and flexible porous backbone with hierarchical pores.








Abstract
The recycling and utilization of precious metals have emerged as a critical research focus in advancing the development of the circular economy. Among numerous methods for recovering precious metals such as gold, adsorbents with both high adsorption selectivity and capacity have become key technologies. This article incorporated the N&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine into a flexible porous polynorbornene backbone to create a class of distinctive porous organic polymers, named BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;14&#8211;BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;17. Through a reductive capture mechanism, the reductive adsorption sites of N&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine coordinate selectively with precious metals, the reduced metal is captured by the hierarchically porous polymers with flexible backbone. This approach leads to remarkable gold recovery efficiency, achieving a record of 2321&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at ambient conditions, and 3020&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 under UV light, surpassing the theoretical limit. The porous polymers are filled in a column for a continuous uptake of gold from waste printed circuit boards (PCBs), showing recovery efficiency toward gold as high as 95% after 84&#160;h. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on designing novel adsorbents for precious metal recovery, providing inspiration for researchers to explore novel adsorption modes and contribute to the advancement of the circular economy.

         <title>Toward Durable CO2 Electroreduction with Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts via Understanding Their Deactivation Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, factors contributing to the gradual loss of performance in copper&#8208;based, ambient temperature CO2 electrochemical reduction systems are summarized into generalized deactivation modes that are applicable to other systems. Fundamental principles and mitigation strategies to each deactivation mode are discussed based on recent in situ/operando characterization studies in structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship.








Abstract
The technology of CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) provides a means to convert CO2, a waste greenhouse gas, into value&#8208;added chemicals. Copper is the most studied element that is capable of catalyzing CO2ER to obtain multicarbon products, such as ethylene, ethanol, acetate, etc., at an appreciable rate. Under the operating condition of CO2ER, the catalytic performance of Cu decays because of several factors that alters the surface properties of Cu. In this review, these factors that cause the degradation of Cu&#8208;based CO2ER catalysts are categorized into generalized deactivation modes, that are applicable to all electrocatalytic systems. The fundamental principles of each deactivation mode and the associated effects of each on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are discussed in detail. Structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship developed from recent in situ/operando characterization studies are presented as evidence of related deactivation modes in operation. With the aim to address these deactivation modes, catalyst design and reaction environment engineering rationales are suggested. Finally, perspectives and remarks built upon the recent advances in CO2ER are provided in attempts to improve the durability of CO2ER catalysts.

         <title>Broadband Negative Photoconductive Response in Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broadband response from the negative photoconductive carbon dots (CDs)&#160;are utilized to achieve the optoelectronic logic gates and optical imaging for the first time. The large specific surface area and abundant hydrophilic groups of the mcu&#8208;CDs endow abundant sites to naturally adsorb and desorb H2O molecules, contributing to the novel negative photoconductivity effect. 








Abstract
Due to the broadband response and low selectivity of external light, negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect holds great potential applications in photoelectric devices. Herein, different photoresponsive carbon nanodots (CDs) are prepared from diverse precursors and the broadband response from the NPC CDs are utilized to achieve the optoelectronic logic gates and optical imaging for the first time. In detail, the mcu&#8208;CDs which are prepared by the microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization of citric acid and urea possess the large specific surface area and abundant hydrophilic groups as sites for the adsorption of H2O molecules and thereby present a high conductivity in dark. Meanwhile, the low affinity of mcu&#8208;CDs to H2O molecules permits the light&#8208;induced desorption of H2O molecules by heat effect and thus endow the mcu&#8208;CDs with a low conductivity under illumination. The easy absorption and desorption of H2O molecules contribute to the extraordinary NPC of mcu&#8208;CDs. With the broadband NPC response in CDs, the optoelectronic logic gates and flexible optical imaging system are established, achieving the applications of &#8220;NOR&#8221; or &#8220;NAND&#8221; logic operations and high&#8208;quality optical images. These findings unveil the unique optoelectronic properties of CDs, and have the potential to advance the applications of CDs in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Accelerated Discovery of (TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x High&#8208;Entropy Alloys With Superior Thermal Stability and a New Crystallization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work performs a high&#8208;throughput investigation of the thermal stability of (TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x&#160;high&#8208;entropy alloys based on combinatorial magnetron co&#8208;sputtering, vacuum annealing, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, observing superior phase and grain size stability than previously reported nanocrystalline counterparts. The effect of composition on thermal stability is evaluated and a new crystallization mechanism is revealed.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline (nc) metals are generally strong yet thermally unstable, rendering them difficult to process and unsuitable for use, particularly at elevated temperatures. Nc multicomponent and high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are found to offer enhanced thermal stability but only in a few empirically discovered systems out of a vast compositional space. In response, this work develops a combinatorial strategy to accelerate the discovery of nc&#8208;(TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x alloy library with distinct thermal stability, in terms of phases and grain sizes. Based on synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy characterizations, a phase transition is observed from amorphous&#8211;crystalline nanocomposites to a body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) phase upon annealing. With increased NbTa content (decreased x value), the system tends to achieve thermally stable dual bcc phases upon annealing; in contrast, alloys with increased TiZrHf content (x &gt; 0.6) maintain a single&#8208;composition nanocomposite state, impeding crystallization and grain growth. This investigation not only broadens the understanding of thermal stability but also delves into the onset of crystallization in HEA systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocrystalline (nc) metals are generally strong yet thermally unstable, rendering them difficult to process and unsuitable for use, particularly at elevated temperatures. Nc multicomponent and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are found to offer enhanced thermal stability but only in a few empirically discovered systems out of a vast compositional space. In response, this work develops a combinatorial strategy to accelerate the discovery of nc-(TiZrHf)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;(NbTa)&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; alloy library with distinct thermal stability, in terms of phases and grain sizes. Based on synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy characterizations, a phase transition is observed from amorphous&#8211;crystalline nanocomposites to a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase upon annealing. With increased NbTa content (decreased &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; value), the system tends to achieve thermally stable dual bcc phases upon annealing; in contrast, alloys with increased TiZrHf content (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.6) maintain a single-composition nanocomposite state, impeding crystallization and grain growth. This investigation not only broadens the understanding of thermal stability but also delves into the onset of crystallization in HEA systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Adaptive Microdrugs Enhance the Chemotherapy of Malignant Glioma: Beyond Their Nanodrugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired adaptive microdrugs can efficiently cross blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier when endowed with good adaptive deformation capacity. Different from the traditional concept, these adaptive microdrugs are more efficient than their nanodrugs in bringing drugs into the glioblastoma tissues, allowing efficient accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization, thus greatly enhancing the antitumor efficacy of malignant glioma.








Abstract
Solid nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery systems are usually confined to nanoscale due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, they remain a great challenge for malignant glioma chemotherapy because of poor drug delivery efficiency and insufficient tumor penetration resulting from the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Inspired by biological microparticles (e.g., cells) with excellent adaptive deformation, it is demonstrated that the adaptive microdrugs (even up to 3.0&#160;&#181;m in size) are more efficient than their nanodrugs (less than 200&#160;nm in size) to cross BBB/BBTB and penetrate into tumor tissues, achieving highly efficient chemotherapy of malignant glioma. The distinct delivery of the adaptive microdrugs is mainly attributed to the enhanced interfacial binding and endocytosis via adaptive deformation. As expected, the obtained adaptive microdrugs exhibit enhanced accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into tumor tissues in comparison with nanodrugs, significantly improving the survival rate of glioblastoma mice. It is believed that the bioinspired adaptive microdrugs enable them to efficiently cross physiological barriers and deeply penetrate tumor tissues for drug delivery, providing an avenue for the treatment of solid tumors.

         <title>3D Nanoprinting of Heterogeneous Metal Oxides with High Shape Fidelity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a 3D nanoprinting method for various metal oxides with high shape fidelity. This method enables 3D nanoprinting and heterogeneous integration of metal oxides with water&#8208;soluble precursor salts, addressing issues of limited material applicability, serious&#160;shape distortion, and challenges of heterogeneous integration in the field of metal oxide 3D microfabrication.








Abstract
3D nanoprinting can significantly enhance the performance of sensors, batteries, optoelectronic/microelectronic devices, etc. However, current 3D nanoprinting methods for metal oxides are suffering from three key issues including limited material applicability, serious shape distortion, and the difficulty of heterogeneous integration. This paper discovers a mechanism in which imidazole and acrylic acid synergistically coordinate with metal ions in water. Using the mechanism, this work develops a series of metal ion synergistic coordination water&#8208;soluble (MISCWS) resins for 3D nanoprinting of various metal oxides, including MnO2, Cr2O3, Co3O4, and ZnO, as well as heterogeneous structures of MnO2/NiO, Cr2O3/Al2O3, and ZnO/MgO. Besides, the synergistic coordination effect results in a 2.54&#8208;fold increase in inorganic mass fraction within the polymer, compared with previous works, which effectively mitigates the shape distortion of metal oxide microstructures. Based on this method, this work also demonstrates a 3D ZnO microsensor with a high sensitivity (1.113 million at 200&#160;ppm NO2), surpassing the conventional 2D ZnO sensors by tenfold. The method yields high&#8208;fidelity 3D structures of heterogeneous metal oxides with nanoscale resolution, paving the way for applications such as sensing, micro&#8208;optics, energy storage, and microsystems.

         <title>Ultrafast Photoexcitation Induced Passivation for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under lower photoexcitation level, the dimensionality reduction process dominates to form low n&#8208;phase 2D perovskite in surface. And the higher photoexcitation level can induce the oxygen doping to fill the vacancies in bulk. In the best synergistic level, this technique can passivate surface defects to inhibit the immersion of moisture and passivate bulk defects to improve carrier transfer, simultaneously.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites exhibit great potential in photodetectors due to their exceptional optoelectronic responsivity and stability, compared to their 3D counterparts. However, the defects are detrimental to the responsivity, response speed, and stability of perovskite photodetectors. Herein, an ultrafast photoexcitation&#8208;induced passivation technique is proposed to synergistically reduce the dimensionality at the surface and induce oxygen doping in the bulk, via tuning the photoexcitation intensity. At the optimal photoexcitation level, the excited electrons and holes generate stretching force on the Pb&#9472;I bonds at the interlayered [PbI6]&#8722;, resulting in low dimensional perovskite formation, and the absorptive oxygen is combined with I vacancies at the same time. These two induced processes synergistically boost the carrier transport and interface contact performance. The most outstanding device exhibits a fast response speed with rise/decay time of 201/627&#160;ns, with a peak responsivity/detectivity of 163 mA W&#8722;1/4.52 &#215; 1010 Jones at 325&#160;nm and the enhanced cycling stability. This work suggests the possibility of a new passivation technique for high performance 2D perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Chiral Kirigami for Bend&#8208;Tolerant Reconfigurable Hologram with Continuously Variable Chirality Measures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that chirality&#8208;guided pixelation of plasmonic kirigami sheets allows tunable multiplexed holography at terahertz (THz) frequencies. The slanted Au strips enable light modulation and real&#8208;time switching of complex grayscale 3D images. The resilient design ensures minimal chirality change with bending, paving the way for fault&#8208;tolerant THz encryption, wearable holographic devices, and advanced communication technologies.








Abstract
Despite the commonality of static holograms, the holography with multiple information layers and reconfigurable grey&#8208;scale images at communication frequencies remain a confluence of scientific challenges. One well&#8208;known difficulty is the simultaneous modulation of phase and amplitude of electromagnetic wavefronts with a high modulation depth. A less appreciated challenge is scrambling of the information and images with hologram bending. Here, this work shows that chirality&#8208;guided pixelation of plasmonic kirigami sheets enables tunable multiplexed holography at terahertz (THz) frequencies. The convex and concave structures with slanted Au strips exhibit gradual variations in geometries facilitating modulation of light ellipticity reaching 40&#160;deg. Real&#8208;time switching of 3D images of the letter &#8220;M&#8221; and the Mona Lisa demonstrates the possibility of complex grey&#8208;scale information content and importance of continuously variable mirror asymmetry. Microscale chirality measures of each pixel experiences little change with bending while retaining controllable reconfigurability upon stretching, which translates to remarkable resilience of chiral holograms to bending. Simplicity of their design with local chirality measures opens the door to information technologies with fault&#8208;tolerant THz encryption, wearable holographic devices, and new communication technologies.

         <title>Multifunctional Dopamine&#8208;Based Hydrogel Microneedle Electrode for Continuous Ketone Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogel microneedle continuous ketone monitoring (HMN&#8208;CKM) sensor utilizes the dopamine's catechol&#8211;quinone chemistry to monitor ketone bodies in interstitial fluid and facilitate formation of a crosslinked hydrogel network for stable entrapment of sensing components. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the HMN&#8208;CKM can track ketone levels of type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#160;rat models in real&#8208;time in conjunction with a data&#8208;driven machine learning model.









Abstract
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a severe complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D), is triggered by production of large quantities of ketone bodies, requiring patients with T1D to constantly monitor their ketone levels. Here, a skin&#8208;compatible hydrogel microneedle (HMN)&#8208;continuous ketone monitoring (HMN&#8208;CKM) device is reported. The sensing mechanism relies on the catechol&#8211;quinone chemistry inherent to&#160;the dopamine (DA) molecules that are covalently linked to the polymer structure of the HMN patch. The DA serves the dual&#8208;purpose of acting as a redox mediator for measuring the byproduct of oxidation of 3&#8208;beta&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (&#946;&#8208;HB), the primary ketone bodies; while, also facilitating the formation of a crosslinked HMN patch. A universal approach involving pre&#8208;oxidation and detection of the generated catechol compounds is introduced to correlate the sensor response to the &#946;&#8208;HB concentrations. It is further shown that real&#8208;time tracking of a decrease in ketone levels of T1D rat model is possible using the HMN&#8208;CKM device, in conjunction with a data&#8208;driven machine learning model that considers potential time delays.

&lt;p&gt;The hydrogel microneedle continuous ketone monitoring (HMN-CKM) sensor utilizes the dopamine's catechol&#8211;quinone chemistry to monitor ketone bodies in interstitial fluid and facilitate formation of a crosslinked hydrogel network for stable entrapment of sensing components. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the HMN-CKM can track ketone levels of type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#160;rat models in real-time in conjunction with a data-driven machine learning model.

         <title>Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Nanovesicles Embedded in Dual&#8208;Layered Hydrogel for Programmed ROS Regulation and Comprehensive Tissue Regeneration in Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanovesicle embedded programable dual&#8208;layered hydrogel is designed for burn wound tissue repair. The inner layer hydrogel first responsively delivers aggregation&#8208;induced emission functionalized stem cell nanovesicles to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for antibiosis. Then, the tissue regeneration can be enhanced consequently though ROS elimination of outer layer hydrogel as well as the nutrients supply and tissue mobilizing effects of stem cell nanovesicles.








Abstract
Burn wounds often bring high risks of delayed healing process and even death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in burn wound repair. However, the dynamic process in wound healing requires both the generation of ROS to inhibit bacteria and the subsequent reduction of ROS levels to initiate and promote tissue regeneration, which calls for a more intelligent ROS regulation dressing system. Hence, a dual&#8208;layered hydrogel (Dual&#8208;Gel) tailored to the process of burn wound repair is designed: the inner layer hydrogel (Gel 2) first responds to bacterial hyaluronidase (Hyal) to deliver aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer functionalized adipose&#8208;derived stem cell nanovesicles, which generate ROS upon light irradiation to eliminate bacteria; then the outer layer hydrogel (Gel 1) continuously starts a long&#8208;lasting consumption of excess ROS at the wound site to accelerate tissue regeneration. Simultaneously, the stem cell nanovesicles trapped in the burns wound also provide nutrients and mobilize neighboring tissues to thoroughly assist in inflammation regulation, cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. In summary, this study develops an intelligent treatment approach on burn wounds by programmatically regulating ROS and facilitating comprehensive wound tissue repair.

         <title>Giant Iontronic Flexoelectricity in Soft Hydrogels Induced by Tunable Biomimetic Ion Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels is reported induced by the ion polarization of cations and anions with different transfer rates under bending deformations, achieving flexoelectric coefficient much higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials.








Abstract
Flexoelectricity features the strain gradient&#8208;induced mechanoelectric conversion using materials not limited by their crystalline symmetry, but state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials exhibit very small flexoelectric coefficients and are too brittle to withstand large deformations. Here, inspired by the ion polarization in living organisms, this paper reports the giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels where the ion polarization is attributed to the different transfer rates of cations and anions under bending deformations. The flexoelectricity is found to be easily regulated by the types of anion&#8211;cation pairs and polymer networks in the hydrogel. A polyacrylamide hydrogel with 1&#160;m NaCl achieves a record&#8208;high flexoelectric coefficient of &#8776;1160 &#181;C m&#8722;1, which can even be improved to &#8776;2340 &#181;C m&#8722;1 by synergizing with the effects of ion pairs and extra polycation chains. Furthermore, the hydrogel as flexoelectric materials can withstand larger bending deformations to obtain higher polarization charges owing to its intrinsic low modulus and high elasticity. A soft flexoelectric sensor is then demonstrated for object recognition by robotic hands. The findings greatly broaden the flexoelectricity to soft, biomimetic, and biocompatible materials and applications.

         <title>Diatom Cribellum&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Metamaterials: Unifying Perfect Absorption Toward Subwavelength Color Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cribellum layer of diatom skeleton, termed frustule, features a hierarchical porous structure on the nanoscale. A diatom cribellum inspired hierarchical metamaterials are presented to integrate the perfect absorption and subwavelength color printing. These diatom cribellum&#8208;inspired metamaterials offer a fresh perspective on multifunctional metamaterial design, promising scalability production by utilizing the frustule as a template for nanopatterning or bio&#8208;template synthesis.








Abstract
Diatom exoskeletons, known as frustules, exhibit a unique multilayer structure that has attracted considerable attention across interdisciplinary research fields as a source of biomorphic inspiration. These frustules possess a hierarchical porous structure, ranging from millimeter&#8208;scale foramen pores to nanometer&#8208;scale cribellum pores. In this study, this natural template for nanopattern design is leveraged to showcase metamaterials that integrates perfect absorption and subwavelength color printing. The cribellum&#8208;inspired hierarchical nanopatterns, organized in a hexagonal unit cell with a periodicity of 300&#160;nm, are realized through a single&#8208;step electron beam lithography process. By employing numerical models, it is uncovered that an additional induced collective dipole mode is the key mechanism responsible for achieving outstanding performance in absorption, reaching up to 99%. Analysis of the hierarchical organization reveals that variations in nanoparticle diameter and inter&#8208;unit&#8208;cell distance lead to shifts and broadening of the resonance peaks. It is also demonstrated that the hierarchical nanopatterns are capable of color reproduction with high uniformity and fidelity, serving as hexagonal pixels for high&#8208;resolution color printing. These cribellum&#8208;inspired metamaterials offer a novel approach to multifunctional metamaterial design, presenting aesthetic potential applications in the development of robotics and wearable electronic devices, such as smart skin or surface coatings integrated with energy harvesting functionalities.

         <title>Extreme Fast Charging of Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Derived Nanocrystal Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a preformed inorganic nanocrystal&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal surface by the developed molten salt immersion approach, which balances high surface modulus and fast Li+ diffusivity. It improves the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for long&#8208;term cycling of lithium metal batteries (up to 500 cycles) under service conditions that include high loadings (up to 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) and extreme fast charging rates (up to 6 C).








Abstract
The extreme fast charging performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with a long life is an important focus in the development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies. The friable solid electrolyte interphase and dendritic lithium growth are major problems. The formation of an inorganic nanocrystal&#8208;dominant interphase produced by preimmersing the Li in molten lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide that suppresses the overgrowth of the usual interphase is reported. Its high surface modulus combined with fast Li+ diffusivity enables a reversible dendrite&#8208;proof deposition under ultrahigh&#8208;rate conditions. It gives a record&#8208;breaking cumulative plating/stripping capacity of &gt;240&#160;000 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@30 mAh cm&#8722;2 for a symmetric cell and an extreme fast charging performance at 6 C for 500 cycles for a Li||LiCoO2 full cell with a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity, thus expanding the use of LMBs to high&#8208;loading and power&#8208;intensive scenarios. Its usability both in roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll production and in different electrolytes indicating the scalable and industrial potential of this process for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Freezing Shrinkage Dynamics and Surface Dendritic Growth of Floating Refractory Alloy Droplets in Outer Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The freezing shrinkage and dendritic growth are of great importance for various alloys solidified from high&#8208;temperature liquids to solids since they dominate microstructure patterns and follow&#8208;up processing. It is found that microgravity solidification leads to remarkable freezing shrinkage cavities and distinctive surface dendritic microstructure patterns in outer space.








Abstract
The freezing shrinkage and dendritic growth are of great importance for various alloys solidified from high&#8208;temperature liquids to solids since they dominate microstructure patterns and follow&#8208;up processing. However, the microgravity freezing shrinkage dynamics is scarcely explored on the ground as it is hard to suppress the strong natural convection inside liquid alloys. Here, a series of in&#8208;orbit solidification experiments is conducted aboard the China Space Station with a long&#8208;term stable 10&#8722;5 g0 microgravity condition. The highest temperature up to 2265&#160;K together with substantial liquid undercoolings far from a thermodynamically stable state are attained for both Nb82.7Si17.3 and Zr64V36 refractory alloys. Furthermore, the solidification under microgravity of a droplet is simulated to reveal the liquid&#8211;solid interface migration, temperature gradient, and flow field. The microgravity solidification process leads to freezing shrinkage cavities and distinctive surface dendritic microstructure patterns. The combined effects of shrinkage dynamics and liquid surface flow in outer space result in the dendrites growing not only along the tangential direction but also along the normal direction to the droplet surface. These space experimental results contribute to a further understanding of the solidification behavior of liquid alloys under a weaker convection condition, which is often masked by gravity on the ground.

         <title>Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging with ROS&#8208;Responsive Bilirubin Nanoparticles Enables Monitoring of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Progression to Cirrhosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a novel nanoparticle&#8208;based imaging probe and associated dual input pseudo&#8208;threecompartment model is reported that enables monitoring the progression of NASH and its transition to the cirrhosis&#8208;like stage by detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) by MRI. Manganese ion&#8208;chelated bilirubin nanoparticles undergo disintegration upon reaction with ROS, thereby releasing free Mn2+ and inducing considerable MRI signal enhancement.








Abstract
Despite the vital importance of monitoring the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an efficient imaging modality that is readily available at hospitals is currently lacking. Here, a new magnetic&#8208;resonance&#8208;imaging (MRI)&#8208;based imaging modality is presented that allows for efficient and longitudinal monitoring of NAFLD and NASH progression. The imaging modality uses manganese&#8208;ion (Mn2+)&#8208;chelated bilirubin nanoparticles (Mn@BRNPs) as a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive MRI imaging probe. Longitudinal T1&#8208;weighted MR imaging of NASH model mice is performed after injecting Mn@BRNPs intravenously. The MR signal enhancement in the liver relative to muscle gradually increases up to 8 weeks of NASH progression, but decreases significantly as NASH progresses to the cirrhosis&#8208;like stage at weeks 10 and 12. A new dual input pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;compartment model is developed to provide information on NASH stage with a single MRI scan. It is also demonstrated that the ROS&#8208;responsive Mn@BRNPs can be used to monitor the efficacy of potential anti&#8208;NASH drugs with conventional MRI. The findings suggest that the ROS&#8208;responsive Mn@BRNPs have the potential to serve as an efficient MRI contrast for monitoring NASH progression and its transition to the cirrhosis&#8208;like stage.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Asymmetric Porous Mesh with Dynamic Mechanical Support Properties Enables Efficient Single&#8208;Stage Repair of Contaminated Abdominal Wall Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;layer asymmetric porous mesh (SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO) designed via simple and efficient in situ freeze&#8211;thaw of PVA solution on the loosely porous surface of SIS can successfully repair the contaminated abdominal wall defect with bio&#8208;adaptive dynamic mechanical support through only single&#8208;stage surgery, showing an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.








Abstract
Contamination tolerance and long&#8208;term mechanical support are the two critical properties of meshes for contaminated abdominal wall defect repair. However, biological meshes with excellent pollution tolerance fail to provide bio&#8208;adaptive long&#8208;term mechanical support due to their rapid degradation. Here, a novel double&#8208;layer asymmetric porous mesh (SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO) is designed by simple and efficient in situ freeze&#8211;thaw of sticky polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution on the loosely porous surface of small intestinal submucosal decellularized matrix (SIS), which can successfully repair the contaminated abdominal wall defect with bio&#8208;adaptive dynamic mechanical support through only single&#8208;stage surgery. The exosome&#8208;loaded degradable loosely porous SIS layer accelerates the tissue healing; meanwhile, the exosome&#8208;loaded densely porous PVA layer can maintain long&#8208;term mechanical support without any abdominal adhesion. In addition, the tensile strength and strain at break of SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO mesh change gradually from 0.37&#160;MPa and 210% to 0.10&#160;MPa and 385% with the degradation of SIS layer. This unique performance can dynamically adapt to the variable mechanical demands during different periods of contaminated abdominal wall reconstruction. As a result, this SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO mesh shows an attractive prospect in the treatment of contaminated abdominal wall defect without recurrence by integrating local immune regulation, tissue remodeling, and dynamic mechanical supporting.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality Ultrathin Ferroelectric Magnesium Molybdenum Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality ultrathin Mg2Mo3O8 crystals are synthesized using chemical vapor deposition. Mg2Mo3O8 crystals of varying thicknesses exhibit notable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties at room temperature, with ferroelectricity retained even at 2&#160;nm thickness. This work introduces nolanites&#8208;type crystals into ultrathin ferroelectrics. The scalable synthesis of stable ultrathin ferroelectric Mg2Mo3O8 expands the scope of ferroelectric materials and may prosper applications of ferroelectrics.








Abstract
The development of ultrathin, stable ferroelectric materials is crucial for advancing high&#8208;density, low&#8208;power electronic devices. Nonetheless, ultrathin ferroelectric materials are rare due to the critical size effect. Here, a novel ferroelectric material, magnesium molybdenum oxide (Mg2Mo3O8) is presented. High&#8208;quality ultrathin Mg2Mo3O8 crystals are synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Ultrathin Mg2Mo3O8 has a wide bandgap (&#8776;4.4&#160;eV) and nonlinear optical response. Mg2Mo3O8 crystals of varying thicknesses exhibit out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties at room temperature, with ferroelectricity retained even at a 2&#160;nm thickness. The Mg2Mo3O8 exhibits a relatively large remanent polarization ranging from 33 to 52&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is tunable by changing its thickness. Notably, Mg2Mo3O8 possesses a high Curie temperature (&gt;980&#160;&#176;C) across various thicknesses. Moreover, the as&#8208;grown Mg2Mo3O8 crystals display remarkable stability under harsh environments. This work introduces nolanites&#8208;type crystal into ultrathin ferroelectrics. The scalable synthesis of stable ultrathin ferroelectric Mg2Mo3O8 expands the scope of ferroelectric materials and may prosper applications of ferroelectrics.

This work presents a novel cochlea organoids&#8208;integrated conductive hydrogel biohybrid system with cochlear implant electroacoustic stimulation (EAS) for cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip construction and high&#8208;throughput drug screening. With this cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform, high&#8208;maturity cochlear organoids can be obtained. The authors also demonstrate the sensitivity of the cochlear organoids to different drug concentrations and screen the precise drug information that can protect the cochlea.








Abstract
Organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips can highly simulate the complex physiological functions of organs, exhibiting broad application prospects in developmental research, disease simulation, as well as new drug research and development. However, there is still less concern about effectively constructing cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;chips. Here, a novel cochlear organoids&#8208;integrated conductive hydrogel biohybrid system with cochlear implant electroacoustic stimulation (EAS) for cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip construction and high&#8208;throughput drug screening, is presented. Benefiting from the superior biocompatibility and electrical property of conductive hydrogel, together with cochlear implant EAS, the inner ear progenitor cells can proliferate and spontaneously shape into spheres, finally forming cochlear organoids with good cell viability and structurally mature hair cells. By incorporating these progenitor cells&#8208;encapsulated hydrogels into a microfluidic&#8208;based cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with culture chambers and a concentration gradient generator, a dynamic and high&#8208;throughput evaluation of inner ear disease&#8208;related drugs is demonstrated. These results indicate that the proposed cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform has great application potential in organoid cultivation and deafness drug evaluation.

         <title>An Integrated Deposition and Passivation Strategy for Controlled Crystallization of 2D/3D Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for depositing multidimensional perovskite thin films is presented, incorporating phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) treatment into the antisolvent step for 3D perovskite formation. Using multimodal in situ characterization, it is shown that PEACl slows crystal growth, resulting in reduced grain boundary recombination and improved device efficiency. PEACl also forms hydrophobic 2D structures, protecting the film from humidity&#8208;induced degradation.








Abstract
This work introduces a simplified deposition procedure for multidimensional (2D/3D) perovskite thin films, integrating a phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl)&#8208;treatment into the antisolvent step when forming the 3D perovskite. This simultaneous deposition and passivation strategy reduces the number of synthesis steps while simultaneously stabilizing the halide perovskite film and improving the photovoltaic performance of resulting solar cell devices to 20.8%. Using a combination of multimodal in situ and additional ex situ characterizations, it is demonstrated that the introduction of PEACl during the perovskite film formation slows down the crystal growth process, which leads to a larger average grain size and narrower grain size distribution, thus reducing carrier recombination at grain boundaries and improving the device's performance and stability. The data suggests that during annealing of the wet film, the PEACl diffuses to the surface of the film, forming hydrophobic (quasi&#8208;)2D structures that protect the bulk of the perovskite film from humidity&#8208;induced degradation.

         <title>Ionic Conduction&#8208;Based Polycrystalline Oxide Gamma Ray Detection &#8211; Radiation&#8208;Ionic Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New radiation detection devices based on ionic conduction modulation at grain boundaries in solid electrolytes. This paves the way to inexpensive, sensitive, low&#8208;power, and miniaturizable solid&#8208;state devices, uniquely suited for operating in harsh environments. Opportunities for portable and/or scalable radiation detectors are created benefiting geothermal drilling, small modular reactors, nuclear security, and waste management.








Abstract
Newly discovered opto&#8208;ionic effects in metal oxides provide unique opportunities for functional ceramic applications. The authors generalize the recently demonstrated grain boundary opto&#8208;ionic effect observed in solid electrolyte thin films under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to a radiation&#8208;ionic effect that can be applied to bulk materials and used for gamma&#8208;rays (&#947;&#8208;rays) detection. Near room temperature, lightly doped Gd&#8208;doped CeO2, a polycrystalline ion conducting ceramic, exhibits a resistance ratio change &#8776;103 and reversible response in ionic current when exposed to 60Co &#947;&#8208;ray (1.1 and 1.3 MeV). This is attributed to the steady state passivation of space charge barriers at grain boundaries, that act as virtual electrodes, capturing radiation&#8208;induced electrons, in turn lowering space charge barrier heights, and thereby exclusively modulating the ionic carrier flow within the ceramic electrolytes. Such behavior allows significant electrical response under low fields, that is, &lt; 2 V cm&#8722;1, paving the way to inexpensive, sensitive, low&#8208;power, and miniaturizable solid&#8208;state devices, uniquely suited for operating in harsh (high temperature, pressure, and corrosive) environments. This discovery presents opportunities for portable and/or scalable radiation detectors benefiting geothermal drilling, small modular reactors, nuclear security, and waste management.

         <title>Nonhalogenated Solvent Processable and High&#8208;Density Photopatternable Polymer Semiconductors Enabled by Incorporating Hydroxyl Groups in the Side Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to boost the solubility of polymer semiconductors in nonhalogenated solvents by appending hydroxyl groups in the side chains is developed. With tetrahydrofuran as the processing and developing solvents, high&#8208;density photopatterning arrays with &#8776;82&#160;000 devices cm&#8722;2 can be achieved, while the charge mobilities of the patterned thin films are mostly maintained.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors hold tremendous potential for applications in flexible devices, which is however hindered by the fact that they are usually processed by halogenated solvents rather than environmentally more friendly solvents. An effective strategy to boost the solubility of high&#8208;performance polymer semiconductors in nonhalogenated solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) by appending hydroxyl groups in the side chains is herein presented. The results show that hydroxyl groups, which can be easily incorporated into the side chains, can significantly improve the solubility of typical p&#8208; and n&#8208;types as well as ambipolar polymer semiconductors in THF. Meanwhile, the thin films of these polymer semiconductors from the respective THF solutions show high charge mobilities. With THF as the processing and developing solvents these polymer semiconductors with hydroxyl groups in the side chains can be well photopatterned in the presence of the photo&#8208;crosslinker, and the charge mobilities of the patterned thin films are mostly maintained by comparing with those of the respective pristine thin films. Notably, THF is successfully utilized as the processing and developing solvent to achieve high&#8208;density photopatterning with &#8776;82&#160;000 device arrays cm&#8722;2 for polymer semiconductors in which hydroxyl groups are appended in the side chains.

Abstract
The method of salt&#8208;assisted vapor&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid (VLS) growth is introduced to synthesize 1D nanostructures of trichalcogenide van der Waals (vdW) materials, exemplified by niobium trisulfide (NbS3). The method uses a unique catalyst consisting of an alloy of Au and an alkali metal halide (NaCl) to enable rapid and directional growth. High yields of two types of NbS3 1D nanostructures, nanowires and nanoribbons, each with sub&#8208;ten nanometer diameter, tens of micrometers length, and distinct 1D morphology and growth orientation are demonstrated. Strategies to control the location, size, and morphology of growth, and extend the growth method to synthesize other transition metal trichalcogenides, NbSe3 and TiS3, as nanowires are demonstrated. Finally, the role of the Au&#8211;NaCl alloy catalyst in guiding VLS synthesis is described and the growth mechanism based on the relationships measured between structure (growth orientation, morphology, and dimensions) and growth conditions (catalyst volume and growth time) is discussed.

&lt;p&gt;The method of salt-assisted vapor&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid (VLS) growth is introduced to synthesize 1D nanostructures of trichalcogenide van der Waals (vdW) materials, exemplified by niobium trisulfide (NbS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The method uses a unique catalyst consisting of an alloy of Au and an alkali metal halide (NaCl) to enable rapid and directional growth.

&lt;p&gt;The method of salt-assisted vapor&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid (VLS) growth is introduced to synthesize 1D nanostructures of trichalcogenide van der Waals (vdW) materials, exemplified by niobium trisulfide (NbS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The method uses a unique catalyst consisting of an alloy of Au and an alkali metal halide (NaCl) to enable rapid and directional growth. High yields of two types of NbS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 1D nanostructures, nanowires and nanoribbons, each with sub-ten nanometer diameter, tens of micrometers length, and distinct 1D morphology and growth orientation are demonstrated. Strategies to control the location, size, and morphology of growth, and extend the growth method to synthesize other transition metal trichalcogenides, NbSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and TiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as nanowires are demonstrated. Finally, the role of the Au&#8211;NaCl alloy catalyst in guiding VLS synthesis is described and the growth mechanism based on the relationships measured between structure (growth orientation, morphology, and dimensions) and growth conditions (catalyst volume and growth time) is discussed. These results introduce opportunities to expand the library of emerging 1D vdW materials to make use of their unique properties through controlled growth at nanoscale dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Ambipolar Polyelectrolyte Capacitors Prepared via Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Assembling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, ambipolar polyelectrolyte capacitors are prepared leveraging a multilayer stack of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer with thickness down to 10&#160;nm. The ambipolar nature of the polyelectrolyte dielectric stack improves the capacitive performance of the device and extends the frequency range of operation, compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art unipolar counterpart.








Abstract
Miniaturized solid state capacitors leveraging migration of unipolar ions in a single polyelectrolyte layer sandwiched between metal electrodes, namely, polyelectrolyte capacitors (PECs), have been recently reported with areal capacitance up to 100&#8211;200&#160;nF mm&#8722;2. Nonetheless, application of PECs in consumer and industrial electronics has been hindered so far by their small operational frequency range, up to a few kHz, due to the resistive behavior (phase angle &gt;&#8722;45&#176;) of PECs in the range kHz&#8208;to&#8208;MHz. Here,&#160;it is reported on multilayer polyelectrolyte capacitors (mPECs) that leverage as dielectric an ambipolar nanometer&#8208;thick (down to 10&#160;nm) stack of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer between metal electrodes to eliminate the resistive behavior at frequencies from kHz to MHz. This significantly extends the operational range of mPECs over PECs. mPECs with areal capacitance as high as 25&#160;nF mm&#8722;2 at 20&#160;Hz and full capacitive behavior from 100 mHz to 10&#160;MHz are demonstrated using different assembling conditions and anionic/cationic polyelectrolyte pairs. The mPECs reliably operate over time for &gt;300 million cycles, at different biasing voltages up to 3&#160;V, and temperatures up to 80&#160;&#176;C, showing a reversible capacitive behavior without significant hysteresis. Application of mPECs in flexible electronics, also operating at high frequency, is envisaged.

         <title>Junctionless Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Device Using 2D Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Layered Materials for Ternary Parallel Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (NDR) device featuring a junctionless vdW channel. The approach for inducing the NDR phenomenon revolves around selectively inhibiting carrier transport, a result accomplished by creating a partial potential barrier within the junctionless channel. To showcase the utility of the junctionless NDR device for a ternary hardware neural network, its practical application is presented by configuring ternary logic circuits.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (NDR) devices offer a promising pathway for developing future computing technologies characterized by exceptionally low energy consumption, especially multivalued logic computing. Nevertheless, conventional approaches aimed at attaining the NDR phenomenon involve intricate junction configurations and/or external doping processes in the channel region, impeding the progress of NDR devices to the circuit and system levels. Here, an NDR device is presented that incorporates a channel without junctions. The NDR phenomenon is achieved by introducing a metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor capacitor to a portion of the channel area. This approach establishes partial potential barrier and well that effectively restrict the movement of hole and electron carriers within specific voltage ranges. Consequently, this facilitates the implementation of both a ternary inverter and a ternary static&#8208;random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, which are essential components in the development of multivalued logic computing technology.

         <title>Tailoring Perovskite Surface Potential and Chelation Advances Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of spatial symmetry on device performance is investigated by using molecules based on symmetrical bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)ammonium cation (B(CE)A+) and asymmetrical 2&#8208;chloroethylammonium cation (CEA+) as interface layers between the perovskite and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. The symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations lead to a more homogeneous surface potential and comprehensive chelation compared to the asymmetrical CEA+ cations. This strategy achieves a remarkable efficiency of 25.60%.








Abstract
Modifying perovskite surface using various organic ammonium halide cations has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the overall performance of perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, the impact of the structural symmetry of these ammonium halide cations on perovskite interface termination has remained uncertain. Here, this work investigates the influence of symmetry on the performance of the devices, using molecules based on symmetrical bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)ammonium cation (B(CE)A+) and asymmetrical 2&#8208;chloroethylammonium cation (CEA+) as interface layers between the perovskite and hole transport layer. These results reveal that the symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations lead to a more homogeneous surface potential and more comprehensive chelation with uncoordinated Pb2+ compared to the asymmetrical cations, resulting in a more favorable energy band alignment and strengthened defect healing. This strategy, leveraging the spatial geometrical symmetry of the interface cations, promotes hole carrier extraction between functional layers and reduces nonradiative recombination on the perovskite surface. Consequently, perovskite solar cells processed with the symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.60% and retain &#8776;91% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point operation. This work highlights the significant benefits of utilizing structurally symmetrical cations in promoting the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Optical Monitoring of Water Side Permeation in Thin Film Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a magnesium&#8208;based optical technique to quantify water permeation in thin film encapsulation, which becomes crucial as devices miniaturize. It highlights that design rules, robust interfacial interactions, and the use of high&#8208;barrier materials like silicon carbide significantly enhance the encapsulation's barrier effectiveness. This offers a novel approach to improving the durability of thin film coatings.








Abstract
The stability of long&#8208;term microfabricated implants is hindered by the presence of multiple water diffusion paths within artificially patterned thin&#8208;film encapsulations. Side permeation, defined as infiltration of molecules through the lateral surface of the thin structure, becomes increasingly critical with the trend of developing high&#8208;density and miniaturized neural electrodes. However, current permeability measurement methods do not account for side permeation accurately nor quantitatively. Here, a novel optical, magnesium (Mg)&#8208;based method is proposed to quantify the side water transmission rate (SWTR) through thin film encapsulation and validate the approach using micrometric polyimide (PI) and polyimide&#8208;silicon carbide (PI&#8208;SiC) multilayers. Through computed digital grayscale images collected with corroding Mg film microcells coated with the thin encapsulation, side and surface WTRs are quantified. A 4.5&#8208;fold ratio between side and surface permeation is observed, highlighting the crucial role of the PI&#8211;PI interface in lateral diffusion. Universal guidelines for the design of flexible, hermetic neural interfaces are proposed. Increasing encapsulation's width (interelectrode spacing), creating stronger interfacial interactions, and integrating high&#8208;barrier interlayers such as SiC significantly enhance the lateral hermeticity.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal Linear Array Detector for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>

A novel 329&#8208;type halide perovskite single crystal (SC) is developed by a new growth strategy, which shows&#160;significantly increased &#181;&#964; product. Therefore, the SC detectors achieve high detection sensitivity, fast response, and superior stability. In addition, the assembled SC linear array detector realizes high spatial resolution during X&#8208;ray imaging, which is expected to be a new&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection technology.








Abstract
0D Bi&#8208;based 329&#8208;type halide perovskite is demonstrated as a promising semiconductor for X&#8208;ray detection due to its strong X&#8208;ray absorption, superior stability, availability of large single crystals (SCs) and solution processibility at low temperature. However, its low mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#181;&#964;) limits its further improvement in detection sensitivity. Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, this work designs a new 2D Bi&#8208;based 329&#8208;type halide perovskite using a mixed&#8208;halide&#8208;induced structural dimension regulation strategy. By using a continuous supply of a precursor solution, this work successfully grows inch&#8208;sized high&#8208;quality SCs. These SCs exhibit large &#181;&#964; product, high resistivity, and low ion migration. The detectors fabricated using the SCs show X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity as high as 24,509 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, short response time of 315 &#181;s, low detection limit of 4.3 nGy s&#8722;1, and superior stability. These properties are the best among all lead&#8208;free perovskite detectors and are comparable to those of the best lead&#8208;based perovskite detectors. The linear array detector assembled on the SCs for the first time also shows a high spatial resolution of 10.6 lp mm&#8722;1 during X&#8208;ray imaging. The high performance combined with superior stability of these new 329&#8208;type lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCs is expected to promote a new generation of X&#8208;ray detection technologies.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Low Modulus of Ductile TiZrHfTa Biomedical High&#8208;Entropy Alloys through Deformation Induced Martensitic Transformation/Twinning/Amorphization</title>

         <dc:description>
Simultaneously achieving an ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, an excellent biocompatibility, and an acceptable ductility possess significant challenges in traditional biomedical alloys. This work presents a generic solution to an ever&#8208;lasting challenge in metal materials design: i.e., achieving low Young's modulus analogous to the human bone while maintaining commendable tensile ductility as well as excellent biocompatibility in a biomedical high&#8208;entropy alloy (Bio&#8208;HEA).








Abstract
Biomedical alloys are paramount materials in biomedical applications, particularly in crafting biological artificial replacements. In traditional biomedical alloys, a significant challenge is simultaneously achieving an ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, excellent biocompatibility, and acceptable ductility. A multi&#8208;component body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) biomedical high&#8208;entropy alloy (Bio&#8208;HEA), which is composed of non&#8208;toxic elements, is noteworthy for its outstanding biocompatibility and compositional tuning capabilities. Nevertheless, the aforementioned challenges still remain. Here, a method to achieve a single phase with the lowest Young's modulus among the constituent phases by precisely tuning the stability of the BCC phase in the Bio&#8208;HEA, is proposed. The subtle tuning of the BCC phase stability also enables the induction of stress&#8208;induced martensite transformation with extremely low trigger stress. The transformation&#8208;induced plasticity and work hardening capacity are achieved via the stress&#8208;induced martensite transformation. Additionally, the hierarchical stress&#8208;induced martensite twin structure and crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation provide robust toughening mechanisms in the Bio&#8208;HEA. The cytotoxicity test confirms that this Bio&#8208;HEA exhibits excellent biocompatibility without cytotoxicity. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the development of biomedical alloys with a combination of ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, excellent biocompatibility, and decent ductility.

         <title>Engineering Anomalously Large Electron Transport in Topological Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plisson, Yao, and coworkers uncover the key ingredients to enormous mobilities in topological semimetals. They prove fine&#8208;tuning of the phonon and electron dispersions leads to a phonon&#8211;electron fluid where momentum&#8208;conserving scattering dominates. This is done by combining DFT, transport, and Raman experiments.








Abstract
Anomalous transport of topological semimetals has generated significant interest for applications in optoelectronics, nanoscale devices, and interconnects. Understanding the origin of novel transport is crucial to engineering the desired material properties, yet their orders of magnitude higher transport than single&#8208;particle mobilities remain unexplained. This work demonstrates the dramatic mobility enhancements result from phonons primarily returning momentum to electrons due to phonon&#8208;electron dominating over phonon&#8211;phonon scattering. Proving this idea, proposed by Peierls in 1932, requires tuning electron and phonon dispersions without changing symmetry, topology, or disorder. This is achieved by combining de Haas &#8208; van Alphen (dHvA), electron transport, Raman scattering, and first&#8208;principles calculations in the topological semimetals MX2 (M = Nb, Ta and X = Ge, Si). Replacing Ge with Si brings the transport mobilities from an order magnitude larger than single particle ones to nearly balanced. This occurs without changing the crystal structure or topology and with small differences in disorder or Fermi surface. Simultaneously, Raman scattering and first&#8208;principles calculations establish phonon&#8211;electron dominated scattering only in the MGe2 compounds. Thus, this study proves that phonon&#8208;drag is crucial to the transport properties of topological semimetals and provides insight to engineer these materials&#160;further.

         <title>Atomic Scale Structure of Self&#8208;Assembled Lipidated Peptide Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up theoretical approach is reported to produce the first atomically resolved experimentally consistent model of lipidated &#946;&#8208;peptide nanomaterials. The &#946;&#8208;peptide materials possess long&#8208;term mechanical and chemical stability in vivo, and may be easily decorated with combinations of different biological cues. This unique combination of properties is conducive to control over the resultant &#946;&#8208;peptide fiber morphology and biocompatibility,&#160;thus providing a substantial advantage over traditional &#945;&#8208;peptide&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Peptides have great potential as novel biomaterials and therapeutic agents, due to their unique&#160;ability to self&#8208;assemble into low dimensional nanostructures,&#160;and their resistance to enzymatic degradation&#160;in vivo. However, the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of &#946;&#8208;peptides, which possess increased flexibility due to the extra backbone methylene groups present within the constituent &#946;&#8208;amino acids, are not well understood due to inherent difficulties of observing their bottom&#8208;up growth pathway experimentally. A computational approach is presented for the bottom&#8208;up modelling of the self&#8208;assembled&#160;lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptides, from monomers, to oligomers, to supramolecular low&#8208;dimensional nanostructures, in all&#8208;atom detail. The approach is applied to elucidate the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of recently discovered, distinct structural morphologies of low dimensional nanomaterials, assembled from lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptide monomers. The resultant structures of the nanobelts and the twisted fibrils are stable throughout subsequent unrestrained all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and these assemblies display good agreement with the structural features obtained from X&#8208;ray fiber diffraction and atomic force microscopy data.&#160;This is the first reported, fully&#8208;atomistic model of a lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptide&#8208;based nanomaterial, and the computational approach developed here, in combination with experimental fiber diffraction analysis and atomic force microscopy, will be useful in elucidating the atomic scale structure of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;based and other supramolecular nanomaterials.

         <dc:description>
A fully inkjet&#8208;printed and integrated multiplexed biosensing patch that exhibits ultra&#8208;high stability and sensitivity. These desirable properties are enabled by the precise control over the active materials mass loading and the unique interpenetrating interfaces, owing to the optimized ink formulations and droplet&#8208;assisted printing processes.








Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as one of the promising tools for tracking human body physiological dynamics via non&#8208;invasive perspiration analysis. However, it remains a key challenge to integrate multiplexed sensors in a highly controllable and reproducible manner to achieve long&#8208;term reliable biosensing, especially on flexible platforms. Herein, a fully inkjet printed and integrated multiplexed biosensing patch with remarkably high stability and sensitivity is reported for the first time. These desirable characteristics are enabled by the unique interpenetrating interface design and precise control over active materials mass loading, owing to the optimized ink formulations and droplet&#8208;assisted printing processes. The sensors deliver sensitivities of 313.28&#160;&#181;A mm&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for glucose and 0.87&#160;&#181;A mm&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for alcohol sensing with minimal drift over 30 h, which are among the best in the literature. The integrated patch can be used for reliable and wireless diet monitoring or medical intervention via epidermal analysis and would inspire the advances of wearable devices for intelligent healthcare applications.

         <title>Trichome&#8208;Like Biomimetic Air Filters via Templated Silicone Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of plant&#8208;based purification, trichome&#8208;like biomimetic (TLB) air filters with three dimensional (3D)&#8208;templated silicon nanofilaments formed in situ onto preset template substrates with an average diameter of &#8776;74 nm are proposed based on a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, demonstrating extraordinary filtration performance.








Abstract
Air pollution threats to human health have increased awareness of the role of filter units in air cleaning applications. As an ideal energy&#8208;saving strategy for air filters, the slip effect on nanofiber surfaces can potentially overcome the trade&#8208;off between filtration efficiency and pressure drop. However, the potential of the slip effect in nanofibrous structures is significantly limited by the tight nanofiber stacks. In this study, trichome&#8208;like biomimetic (TLB) air filters with 3D&#8208;templated silicone nanofilaments (average diameter: &#8776;74 nm) are prepared based on an in situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method inspired by plant purification. Theoretical modeling and experimental results indicate that TLB air filters make significant use of the slip effect to overcome the efficiency&#8208;resistance tradeoff. The selectable filter class (up to U15, &#8776;99.9995%) allows TLB air filters to meet various requirements, and their integral filtration performance surpasses that of most commodity air filters, including melt&#8208;blown cloth, ePTFE membranes, electrospun mats, and glass fiber paper. The proposed strategy directly transforms commercial filter media and filters into TLB air filters using a bottom&#8208;up, one&#8208;step approach. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, reusable N95 respirators and air purifiers equipped with TLB air filters are fabricated, overcoming the limitations of existing filter designs and fabrication methods.

         <title>Giant Modulation of Refractive Index from Picoscale Atomic Displacements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
At room temperature, quasi&#8211;1D chalcogenide crystal BaTiS3 shows structural disorder due to off&#8211;centering Ti displacements along the ab&#8211;plane that is perpendicular to the long axis. These disordered Ti displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab&#8211;plane and result in a giant enhancement of optical anisotropy. Thus, structural disorder provides a new degree&#8211;of&#8211;freedom for light manipulation in photonic applications.








Abstract
It is shown that structural disorder&#8212;in the form of anisotropic, picoscale atomic displacements&#8212;modulates the refractive index tensor and results in the giant optical anisotropy observed in BaTiS3, a quasi&#8208;1D hexagonal chalcogenide. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal the presence of antipolar displacements of Ti atoms within adjacent TiS6 chains along the c&#8208;axis, and threefold degenerate Ti displacements in the a&#8211;b plane. 47/49Ti solid&#8208;state NMR provides additional evidence for those Ti displacements in the form of a three&#8208;horned NMR lineshape resulting from a low symmetry local environment around Ti atoms. Scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the globally disordered Ti a&#8211;b plane displacements and find them to be ordered locally over a few unit cells. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the Ti a&#8211;b plane displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab&#8208;plane, while having minimal impact on the refractive index along the chain direction, thus resulting in a giant enhancement in the optical anisotropy. By showing a strong connection between structural disorder with picoscale displacements and the optical response in BaTiS3, this study opens a pathway for designing optical materials with high refractive index and functionalities such as large optical anisotropy and nonlinearity.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Large&#8208;Scale 2D CrTe2 Films on Amorphous Silicon Wafers With Low Thermal Budget</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded growth technique is developed for crystallizing large&#8208;scale 2D CrTe2 films on amorphous SiNx/Si substrates with a low thermal budget. Grain boundaries, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and magnetic&#8211;electrical behavior of 2D CrTe2 magnets are controlled through crystallinity engineering. This work paves the way for large&#8208;scale batch manufacturing of practical magneto&#8211;electronic and spintronic devices, heralding a new era of technological innovation.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets open landmark horizons in the development of innovative spintronic device architectures. However, their fabrication with large scale poses challenges due to high synthesis temperatures (&gt;500 &#176;C) and difficulties in integrating them with standard complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology on amorphous substrates such as silicon oxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (SiNx). Here, a seeded growth technique for crystallizing CrTe2 films on amorphous SiNx/Si and SiO2/Si substrates with a low thermal budget is presented. This fabrication process optimizes large&#8208;scale, granular atomic layers on amorphous substrates, yielding a substantial coercivity of 11.5 kilo&#8208;oersted, attributed to weak intergranular exchange coupling. Field&#8208;driven N&#233;el&#8208;type stripe domain dynamics explain the amplified coercivity. Moreover, the granular CrTe2 devices on Si wafers display significantly enhanced magnetoresistance, more than doubling that of single&#8208;crystalline counterparts. Current&#8208;assisted magnetization switching, enabled by a substantial spin&#8211;orbit torque with a large spin Hall angle (85) and spin Hall conductivity (1.02 &#215; &#8201;107 &#8463;/2e&#8201; &#937;&#8315;&#185;&#8201; m&#8315;&#185;), is also demonstrated. These observations underscore the proficiency in manipulating crystallinity within integrated 2D magnetic films on Si wafers, paving the way for large&#8208;scale batch manufacturing of practical magnetoelectronic and spintronic devices, heralding a new era of technological innovation.

         <title>Topologically Protected Quantum Logic Gates with Valley&#8208;Hall Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, He et&#160;al. provide a scheme to experimentally realize the topologically protected quantum logic gates, including control&#8208;NOT and Hadamard gates, on the silicon photonic platform. These quantum gates not only have high experimental fidelities but also exhibit a certain degree of tolerances against certain types of defects, which paves the way for future optical quantum computations.








Abstract
Topological photonics provide a promising way to realize more robust optical devices against some defects and environmental perturbations. Quantum logic gates are fundamental units of quantum computers, which are widely used in future quantum information processing. Thus, constructing robust universal quantum logic gates is an important way forward to practical quantum computing. However, the most important problem to be solved is how to construct the quantum&#8208;logic&#8208;gate&#8208;required 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 beam splitter with topological protection. Here, the experimental realization of the topologically protected contradirectional coupler is reported, which can be employed to realize the quantum logic gates, including control&#8208;NOT and Hadamard gates, on the silicon photonic platform. These quantum gates not only have high experimental fidelities but also exhibit a certain degree of tolerances against certain types of defects. This work paves the way for the development of practical optical quantum computations and signal processing.

         <title>Ultrafast Non&#8208;Volatile Floating&#8208;Gate Memory Based on All&#8208;2D Materials</title>

         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;volatile floating&#8208;gate memory devices with all functional layers made of 2D materials with atomically sharp interface, including MoS2 channel layer, hBN tunnel layer, multilayer graphene (MLG) floating&#8208;gate layer, hBN block layer and MLG control gate layer, can be ultrafastly programmed/erased in &#8776;20&#160;ns with high extinction ratios (up to 108) and long&#8208;term retention characteristics.








Abstract
The explosive growth of massive&#8208;data storage and the demand for ultrafast data processing require innovative memory devices with exceptional performance. 2D materials and their van der Waal heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces hold great promise for innovations in memory devices. Here, this work presents non&#8208;volatile, floating&#8208;gate memory devices with all functional layers made of 2D materials, achieving ultrafast programming/erasing speeds (20&#160;ns), high extinction ratios (up to 108), and multi&#8208;bit storage capability. These devices also exhibit long&#8208;term data retention exceeding 10 years, facilitated by a high gate&#8208;coupling ratio (GCR) and atomically sharp interfaces between functional layers. Additionally, this work demonstrates the realization of an &#8220;OR&#8221; logic gate on a single&#8208;device unit by synergistic electrical and optical operations. The present results provide a solid foundation for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;speed, ultralong lifespan, non&#8208;volatile memory devices, with a potential for scale&#8208;up manufacturing and flexible electronics applications.

         <title>Efficient Delivery of Lomitapide using Hybrid Membrane&#8208;Coated Tetrahedral DNA Nanostructures for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a biomimetic nanodrug delivery system, RFA nanoparticles is constructed, which takes into account long&#8208;term circulation within the bloodstream and drug&#8208;carrying function, and can combine active targeting and immune escape to deliver lomitapide stably targeted to the cancer cells behind the blood&#8208;brain barrier, which achieved efficient, stable and safe drug therapy for glioblastoma.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and prevalent primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Traditional chemotherapy has poor therapeutic effects and significant side effects due to drug resistance, the natural blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), and nonspecific distribution, leading to a lack of clinically effective therapeutic drugs. Here, 1430 small molecule compounds are screened based on a high&#8208;throughput drug screening platform and a novel anti&#8208;GBM drug, lomitapide (LMP) is obtained. Furthermore, a bionic nanodrug delivery system (RFA NPs) actively targeting GBM is constructed, which mainly consists of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (tFNA NPs) loaded with LMP as the core and a folate&#8208;modified erythrocyte&#8211;cancer cell&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (FRUR) as the shell. FRUR camouflage conferred unique features on tFNA NPs, including excellent biocompatibility, improved pharmacokinetic profile, efficient BBB permeability, and tumor targeting ability. The results show that the LMP RFA NPs exhibited superior and specific anti&#8208;GBM activities, reduced off&#8208;target drug delivery, prolonged lifespan, and has negligible side effects in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study combines high&#8208;throughput drug screening with biomimetic nanodrug delivery system technology to provide a theoretical and practical basis for drug development and the optimization of clinical treatment strategies for GBM treatment.

         <title>Dynamic Hyperspectral Holography Enabled by Inverse&#8208;Designed Metasurfaces with Oblique Helicoidal Cholesterics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic hyperspectral holography is experimentally demonstrated by combining the inverse&#8208;designed&#8208;metasurface and the oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal. The inverse design enables high information capacity of the multicolor holography and the oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal provides precise and tunable spectral modulation. As a proof of concept, the optical secret&#8208;sharing platform is demonstrated.









Abstract
Metasurfaces are flat arrays of nanostructures that allow exquisite control of phase and amplitude of incident light. Although metasurfaces offer new active element for both fundamental science and applications, the challenge still remains to overcome their low information capacity and passive nature. Here, by integrating an inverse&#8208;designed&#8208;metasurface with oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal (ChOH), simultaneous spatial and spectral tunable metasurfaces with a high information capacity for dynamic hyperspectral holography, are demonstrated. The inverse design facilitates a single&#8208;phase map encoding of ten independent holographic images at different wavelengths. ChOH provides precise spectral modulation with narrow bandwidth and wide tunable regime in response to programmed stimuli, thus enabling dynamic switching of the multicolor holography. The results provide simple and generalizable principles for the rational design of interactive metasurfaces that will find numerous applications, including security platform.

         <title>Sprayable Hydrogel Sealant for Gastrointestinal Wound Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
GastroShield, an sprayable adhesive hydrogel, offers a novel solution to postoperative gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Utilizing polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Pluronic and oxidized dextran, the hydrogel forms an instant, durable shield upon application via endoscopic spray, proven safe and effective in multiple animal models. This hydrogel uses a new approach for GI wound care, decreasing postoperative complications such as bleeding and perforation. 








Abstract
Naturally occurring internal bleeding, such as in stomach ulcers, and complications following interventions, such as polyp resection post&#8208;colonoscopy, may result in delayed (5&#8211;7 days) post&#8208;operative adverse events&#8212;such as bleeding, intestinal wall perforation, and leakage. Current solutions for controlling intra&#8208; and post&#8208;procedural complications are limited in effectiveness. Hemostatic powders only provide a temporary solution due to their short&#8208;term adhesion to GI mucosal tissues (less than 48 h). In this study, a sprayable adhesive hydrogel for facile application and sustained adhesion to GI lesions is developed using clinically available endoscopes. Upon spraying, the biomaterial (based on polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Pluronic micelles precursor and oxidized dextran) instantly gels upon contact with the tissue, forming an adhesive shield. In vitro and in vivo studies in guinea pigs, rabbits, and pig models confirm the safety and efficacy of this biomaterial in colonic and acidic stomach lesions. The authors' findings highlight that this family of hydrogels ensures prolonged tissue protection (3&#8211;7 days), facilitates wound healing, and minimizes the risk of delayed complications. Overall, this technology offers a readily adoptable approach for gastrointestinal wound management.

&lt;p&gt;Naturally occurring internal bleeding, such as in stomach ulcers, and complications following interventions, such as polyp resection post-colonoscopy, may result in delayed (5&#8211;7 days) post-operative adverse events&#8212;such as bleeding, intestinal wall perforation, and leakage. Current solutions for controlling intra- and post-procedural complications are limited in effectiveness. Hemostatic powders only provide a temporary solution due to their short-term adhesion to GI mucosal tissues (less than 48 h). In this study, a sprayable adhesive hydrogel for facile application and sustained adhesion to GI lesions is developed using clinically available endoscopes. Upon spraying, the biomaterial (based on polyethyleneimine-modified Pluronic micelles precursor and oxidized dextran) instantly gels upon contact with the tissue, forming an adhesive shield. In vitro and in vivo studies in guinea pigs, rabbits, and pig models confirm the safety and efficacy of this biomaterial in colonic and acidic stomach lesions. The authors' findings highlight that this family of hydrogels ensures prolonged tissue protection (3&#8211;7 days), facilitates wound healing, and minimizes the risk of delayed complications. Overall, this technology offers a readily adoptable approach for gastrointestinal wound management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topological Spin Textures in an Insulating van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a skyrmion lattice in van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr3 opens pathways for exploration of topological spin textures in 2D insulating crystals. These skyrmions manifest in unusual crystalline environment characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structure and are stabilized through dipolar rather than Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The construction of B&#8208;T phase diagram enables versatile phase&#8208;switching mechanisms for controlling magnetization textures.








Abstract
Generation and control of topological spin textures constitutes one of the most exciting challenges of modern spintronics given their potential applications in information storage technologies. Of particular interest are magnetic insulators, which due to low damping, absence of Joule heating and reduced dissipation can provide energy&#8208;efficient spin&#8208;textures platform. Here, it is demonstrated that the interplay between sample thickness, external magnetic fields, and optical excitations can generate a prolific paramount of spin textures, and their coexistence in insulating CrBr3 van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets. Using high&#8208;resolution magnetic force microscopy and large&#8208;scale micromagnetic simulation methods, the existence of a large region in T&#8208;B phase diagram is demonstrated where different stripe domains, skyrmion crystals, and magnetic domains exist and can be intrinsically selected or transformed to each&#8208;other via a phase&#8208;switch mechanism. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy unveils the mixed chirality of the magnetic textures that are of Bloch&#8208;type at given conditions but can be further manipulated into N&#233;el&#8208;type or hybrid&#8208;type via thickness&#8208;engineering. The topological phase transformation between the different magnetic objects can be further inspected by standard photoluminescence optical probes resolved by circular polarization indicative of an existence of exciton&#8208;skyrmion coupling mechanism. The findings identify vdW magnetic insulators as a promising framework of materials for the manipulation and generation of highly ordered skyrmion lattices relevant for device integration at the atomic level.

         <title>Concurrent Ammonia Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation Boosted by Glutathione&#8208;Capped Quantum Dots under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the protein environment for NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ process, glutathione&#8208;capped quantum dot is designed to accomplish efficient, selective, and scalable ammonia and ketone synthesis via NOx&#8722; reduction and alcohol oxidation concurrently under visible light. The positively&#8208;shifted surface charge and cogenerating GS&#183;and H&#183; radicals facilitate balanced electron and hole utilization, offering promising synthetic potential of value&#8208;added nitrogenous chemicals.








Abstract
Mother nature accomplishes efficient ammonia synthesis via cascade N2 oxidation by lightning strikes followed with enzyme&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen oxyanion (NOx&#8722;, x = 2,3) reduction. The protein environment of enzymatic centers for NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ process greatly inspires the design of glutathione&#8208;capped (GSH) quantum dots (QDs) for ammonia synthesis under visible light (440&#160;nm) in tandem with plasma&#8208;enabled N2 oxidation. Mechanistic studies reveal that GSH induces positive shift of surface charge to strengthen the interaction between NOx&#8722; and QDs. Upon visible light irradiation of QDs, the balanced and rapid hole and electron transfer furnish GS&#183;radicals for 2e&#8722;/2H+ alcohol oxidation and H&#183;for 8e&#8722;/10H+ NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ reduction simultaneously. For the first time, mmol&#8208;scale ammonia synthesis is realized with apparent quantum yields of 5.45% &#177; 0.64%, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of value&#8208;added acetophenone and NH4Cl proceeds with 1:4 stoichiometry and stability, demonstrating promising multielectron and multiproton ammonia synthesis efficiency and sustainability with nature&#8208;inspired artificial photocatalysts.

         <title>Imaging the Breakdown and Restoration of Topological Protection in Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant exchange gap fluctuation has been discovered in a five&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 thin film using scanning tunneling microscopy. By applying a 1T out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, the gap fluctuation can be reduced. These findings provide valuable insight into the breakdown of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), revealing that magnetic disorder in odd&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 thin films must be overcome in order to realize QAHE at higher temperatures.








Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators transport charge without resistance along topologically protected chiral 1D edge states. Yet, in magnetic topological insulators to date, topological protection is far from robust, with zero&#8208;magnetic field QAH effect only realized at temperatures an order of magnitude below the N&#233;el temperature TN, though small magnetic fields can stabilize QAH effect. Understanding why topological protection breaks down is therefore essential to realizing QAH effect at higher temperatures. Here a scanning tunneling microscope is used to directly map the size of exchange gap (Eg,ex) and its spatial fluctuation in the QAH insulator 5&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4. Long&#8208;range fluctuations of Eg,ex are observed, with values ranging between 0 (gapless) and 70 meV, appearing to be uncorrelated to individual surface point defects. The breakdown of topological protection is directly imaged, showing that the gapless edge state, the hallmark signature of a QAH insulator, hybridizes with extended gapless regions in the bulk. Finally, it is unambiguously demonstrated that the gapless regions originate from magnetic disorder, by demonstrating that a small magnetic field restores Eg,ex in these regions, explaining the recovery of topological protection in magnetic fields. The results indicate that overcoming magnetic disorder is the key to exploiting the unique properties of QAH insulators.

         <title>Electrically Controlled All&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions on Silicon with Large Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions featuring both electrical switching by spin&#8211;orbit torque, and electrical readout of their antiferromagnetic state by a large room&#8208;temperature tunnel magnetoresistance effect are reported. The devices are based on noncollinear antiferromagnetic PtMn3 and are sputter&#8208;deposited on silicon. These results pave the path toward realizing antiferromagnetic memory and high&#8208;frequency devices integrated on established semiconductor technologies.








Abstract
Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are a pathway to spintronic memory and computing devices with unprecedented speed, energy efficiency, and bit density. Realizing this potential requires AFM devices with simultaneous electrical writing and reading of information, which are also compatible with established silicon&#8208;based manufacturing. Recent experiments have shown tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) readout in epitaxial AFM tunnel junctions. However, these TMR structures are not grown using a silicon&#8208;compatible deposition process, and controlling their AFM order required external magnetic fields. Here are shown three&#8208;terminal AFM tunnel junctions based on the noncollinear antiferromagnet PtMn3, sputter&#8208;deposited on silicon. The devices simultaneously exhibit electrical switching using electric currents, and electrical readout by a large room&#8208;temperature TMR effect. First&#8208;principles calculations explain the TMR in terms of the momentum&#8208;resolved spin&#8208;dependent tunneling conduction in tunnel junctions with noncollinear AFM electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are a pathway to spintronic memory and computing devices with unprecedented speed, energy efficiency, and bit density. Realizing this potential requires AFM devices with simultaneous electrical writing and reading of information, which are also compatible with established silicon-based manufacturing. Recent experiments have shown tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) readout in epitaxial AFM tunnel junctions. However, these TMR structures are not grown using a silicon-compatible deposition process, and controlling their AFM order required external magnetic fields. Here are shown three-terminal AFM tunnel junctions based on the noncollinear antiferromagnet PtMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, sputter-deposited on silicon. The devices simultaneously exhibit electrical switching using electric currents, and electrical readout by a large room-temperature TMR effect. First-principles calculations explain the TMR in terms of the momentum-resolved spin-dependent tunneling conduction in tunnel junctions with noncollinear AFM electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Moir&#233; Pattern Controlled Phonon Polarizer Based on Twisted Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, thermal experiment&#160;in twisted graphene is reported, measuring Moir&#233; angle&#8208;depedent thermal conductance and revealing fundamental relationship between twist angles and phonon behaviors. As revealed by experimental measurements and atomistic calculations, the dominant tuning mechanisms for tuning phonon transmission stem from high&#8208;frequency thermal modes while negligible effects on low&#8208;frequency acoustic modes near Brillouin zone center. This study offers crucial insights into mode&#8208;depedent&#160;thermal transport in Moir&#233; structures, opening avenues for the invention of quantum devices and new design methodologies based on manipulations of vibrational band structures and phonon spectra.








Abstract
Twisted van der Waals materials featuring Moir&#233; patterns present new design possibilities and demonstrate unconventional behaviors in electrical, optical, spintronic, and superconducting properties. However, experimental exploration of thermal transport across Moir&#233; patterns has not been as extensive, despite its critical role in nanoelectronics, thermal management, and energy technologies. Here, the&#160;first experimental study is conducted on thermal transport across twisted graphene, demonstrating a phonon polarizer concept from the rotational misalignment between stacked layers. The direct thermal and acoustic measurements,&#160;structural characterizations, and atomistic modeling, reveal a modulation up to 631% in thermal conductance with various Moir&#233; angles, while maintaining a high acoustic transmission. By comparing experiments with density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, mode&#8208;dependent phonon transmissions are quantified based on the angle alignment of graphene band structures and attributed to the coupling among flexural phonon modes. The agreement confirms the dominant tuning mechanisms in adjusting phonon transmission from high&#8208;frequency thermal modes while having negligible effects on low&#8208;frequency acoustic modes near Brillouin zone center. This study offers crucial insights into the fundamental thermal transport in Moir&#233; structures, opening avenues for the invention of quantum thermal devices and new design methodologies based on manipulations of vibrational band structures and phonon spectra.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Perylene Diimide Trimer Material for N&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of creating air&#8208;stable small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors is reported with helical perylene&#8208;diimide trimer (hPDI[3]) as the model material. Alkyl sidechains are grafted onto the molecular semiconductors to increase its thin&#8208;film solution processability, then removed to create films with better ion transport and stability. High&#8208;transconductance organic electrochemical transistors are made with side&#8208;chainless hPDI[3] as the active material.








Abstract
A new method is reported to make air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor (OMIEC) films for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) using a solution&#8208;processable small molecule helical perylene diimide trimer, hPDI[3]&#8208;C11. Alkyl side chains are attached to the conjugated core for processability and film making, which are then cleaved via thermal annealing. After the sidechains are removed, the hPDI[3] film becomes less hydrophobic, more ordered, and has a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). These features provide improved ionic transport, greater electronic mobility, and increased stability in air and in aqueous solution. Subsequently, hPDI[3]&#8208;H is used as the active material in OECTs and a device with a transconductance of 44 mS, volumetric capacitance of &#8776;250 F cm&#8722;3, &#181;C* value of 1 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and excellent stability (&gt; 5 weeks) is demonstrated. As proof of their practical applications, a hPDI[3]&#8208;H&#8208;based OECTs as a glucose sensor and electrochemical inverter is utilized. The approach of side chain removal after film formation charts a path to a wide range of molecular semiconductors to be used as stable, mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Control of Arsenic Incorporation in Silicon for High&#8208;Yield Artificial Lattice Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single arsenic atoms are deterministically incorporated into a silicon lattice with up to 100% yield. This is achieved using arsine gas as a precursor to arsenic incorporation via scanning tunneling microscopy hydrogen resist lithography. A detailed understanding of the surface chemistry of arsine on lithographically patterned hydrogen&#8208;terminated Si(001) underpins the fabrication of a 2 &#215; 2 single&#8208;atom arsenic artificial lattice.








Abstract
Artificial lattices constructed from individual dopant atoms within a semiconductor crystal hold promise to provide novel materials with tailored electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. These custom&#8208;engineered lattices are anticipated to enable new, fundamental discoveries in condensed matter physics and lead to the creation of new semiconductor technologies including analog quantum simulators and universal solid&#8208;state quantum computers. This work reports precise and repeatable, substitutional incorporation of single arsenic atoms into a silicon lattice. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy hydrogen resist lithography and a detailed statistical exploration of the chemistry of arsine on the hydrogen&#8208;terminated silicon (001) surface are employed to show that single arsenic dopants can be deterministically placed within four silicon lattice sites and incorporated with 97 &#177; 2% yield. These findings bring closer to the ultimate frontier in semiconductor technology: the deterministic assembly of atomically precise dopant and qubit arrays at arbitrarily large scales.

         <title>Fast Na+ Kinetics and Suppressed Voltage Hysteresis Enabled by a High&#8208;Entropy Strategy for Sodium Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy configuration within transition metal slabs helps to strengthen TMO2 skeleton and enlarge the sodium ion diffusion channel, which promotes fast Na+ kinetics, reversible TM redox and phase transition as well as decreased voltage hysteresis, thus achieving impressive electrochemical performance for sodium oxide cathodes.








Abstract
O3&#8208;type layered transition metal cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their sufficient sodium reservoir. However, sluggish sodium ions kinetics and large voltage hysteresis, which are generally associated with Na+ diffusion properties and electrochemical phase transition reversibility, drastically minimize energy density, reduce energy efficiency, and hinder further commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, this work proposes a high&#8208;entropy tailoring strategy through manipulating the electronic local environment within transition metal slabs to circumvent these issues. Experimental analysis combined with theoretical calculations verify that high&#8208;entropy metal ion mixing contributes to the improved reversibility of redox reaction and O3&#8211;P3&#8211;O3 phase transition behaviors as well as the enhanced Na+ diffusivity. Consequently, the designed O3&#8208;Na0.9Ni0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Mn0.2Ti0.15Cu0.05O2 material with high&#8208;entropy characteristic could display a negligible voltage hysteresis (&lt;0.09 V), impressive rate capability (98.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 5 C). This work provides insightful guidance in mitigating the voltage hysteresis and facilitating Na+ diffusion of layered oxide cathode materials to realize high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>2D Catalytic Nanozyme Enables Cascade Enzyodynamic Effect&#8208;Boosted and Ca2+ Overload&#8208;Induced Synergistic Ferroptosis/Apoptosis in Tumor</title>

2D Ca2Mn8O16 nanosheets with five enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities are rationally designed, engineered, and developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ overload for ferroptosis/apoptosis synergistic therapy of lung cancer.








Abstract
The introduction of glucose oxidase, exhibiting characteristics of glucose consumption and H2O2 production, represents an emerging antineoplastic therapeutic approach that disrupts nutrient supply and promotes efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the instability of natural enzymes and their low therapeutic efficacy significantly impede their broader application. In this context, 2D Ca2Mn8O16 nanosheets (CMO NSs) designed and engineered to serve as a high&#8208;performance nanozyme, enhancing the enzyodynamic effect for a ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic tumor therapy, are presented. In addition to mimicking activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, oxidase, and peroxidase, the engineered CMO NSs exhibit glucose oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities. This feature contributes to their antitumor performance through cascade catalytic reactions, involving the disruption of glucose supply, self&#8208;supply of H2O2, and subsequent efficient ROS generation. The exogenous Ca2+ released from CMO NSs, along with the endogenous Ca2+ enrichment induced by ROS from the peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of CMO NSs, collectively mediate Ca2+ overload, leading to apoptosis. Importantly, the ferroptosis process is triggered synchronously through ROS output and glutathione consumption. The application of exogenous ultrasound stimulation further enhances the efficiency of ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic tumor treatment. This work underscores the crucial role of enzyodynamic performance in ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic therapy against tumors.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Charge Density Wave for Strongly Enhanced 2D Superconductivity in 1H&#8208;TaS2 Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3 &#215; 3 charge density wave (CDW) order and enhanced 2D Ising superconductivity (SC) are demonstrated in (SnS)1.15TaS2 van der Waals superlattices, which exhibit monolayer&#8208;like electronic characteristics. The observed low&#8208;lying sulfur p band rearrangement implies a novel CDW driving force, providing new insights into the long&#8208;debated CDW order and 2D SC in monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers offer a fertile platform for exploring unconventional Ising superconductivity (SC) and charge density waves (CDWs). However, the vulnerability of isolated monolayers to structural disorder and environmental oxidation often degrade their electronic coherence. Herein, an alternative approach is reported for fabricating stable and intrinsic monolayers of 1H&#8208;TaS2 sandwiched between SnS blocks in a (SnS)1.15TaS2 van der Waals (vdW) superlattice. The SnS block layers not only decouple individual 1H&#8208;TaS2 sublayers to endow them with monolayer&#8208;like electronic characteristics, but also protect the 1H&#8208;TaS2 layers from electronic degradation. The results reveal the characteristic 3 &#215; 3 CDW order in 1H&#8208;TaS2 sublayers associated with electronic rearrangement in the low&#8208;lying sulfur p band, which uncovers a previously undiscovered CDW mechanism rather than the conventional Fermi surface&#8208;related framework. Additionally, the (SnS)1.15TaS2 superlattice exhibits a strongly enhanced Ising&#8208;like SC with a layer&#8208;independent Tc of &#8776;3.0 K, comparable to that of the isolated monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 sample, presumably attributed to their monolayer&#8208;like characteristics and retained Fermi states. These results provide new insights into the long&#8208;debated CDW order and enhanced SC of monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2, establishing bulk vdW superlattices as promising platforms for investigating exotic collective quantum phases in the 2D limit.

         <title>CogniFiber: Harnessing Biocompatible and Biodegradable 1D Collagen Nanofibers for Sustainable Nonvolatile Memory and Synaptic Learning Applications</title>

Biocompatible and biodegradable 1D collagen nanofibers demonstrate excellent resistive switching properties. The collagen&#8208;nanofiber&#8208;based device exhibits favorable resistive switching properties, showcasing voltage&#8208;tunable analog memory behavior. The optimized device demonstrates reliable nonvolatile memory performance, mimicking biological synaptic learning, and displaying good biocompatibility and cytotoxicity properties. This underscores the potential of 1D collagen nanofibers for biocompatible and biodegradable electronics.








Abstract
Here, resistive switching (RS) devices are fabricated using naturally abundant, nontoxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable biomaterials. For this purpose, 1D chitosan nanofibers (NFs), collagen NFs, and chitosan&#8211;collagen NFs are synthesized by using an electrospinning technique. Among different NFs, the collagen&#8208;NFs&#8208;based device shows promising RS characteristics. In particular, the optimized Ag/collagen NFs/fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide RS device shows a voltage&#8208;tunable analog memory behavior and good nonvolatile memory properties. Moreover, it can also mimic various biological synaptic learning properties and can be used for pattern classification applications with the help of the spiking neural network. The time series analysis technique is employed to model and predict the switching variations of the RS device. Moreover, the collagen NFs have shown good cytotoxicity and anticancer properties, suggesting excellent biocompatibility as a switching layer. The biocompatibility of collagen NFs is explored with the help of NRK&#8208;52E (Normal Rat Kidney cell line) and MCF&#8208;7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation&#8208;7 cancer cell line). Additionally, the biodegradability of the device is evaluated through a physical transient test. This work provides a vital step toward developing a biocompatible and biodegradable switching material for sustainable nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computing applications.

         <title>Binary Solvent Induced Stable Interphase Layer for Ultra&#8208;Long Life Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, introducing 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) as a co&#8208;solvent to diglyme (Dig) leads to a more anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure even at low salt concentrations, thereby inducing a thin uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The thin, robust SEI layer formed can promote long&#8208;term stable electrochemical cycling of sodium metal anode, elucidating the critical role of anion stabilizing co&#8208;solvents for stable sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Sodium foil, promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, faces reversibility challenges due to its inherent reactivity and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. In this study, a stable sodium metal battery (SMB) is achieved by tuning the electrolyte solvation structure through the addition of co&#8208;solvent 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) to diglyme (Dig). The introduction of cyclic ether&#8208;based MTHF results in increased anion incorporation in the solvation structure, even at lower salt concentrations. Specifically, the anion stabilization capabilities of the environmentally sustainable MTHF co&#8208;solvent lead to a contact&#8208;ion pair&#8208;based solvation structure. Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy analysis reveals that a shift toward an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure promotes the formation of a thin and uniform SEI layer. Consequently, employing a NaPF6&#8208;based electrolyte with a Dig:MTHF ratio of 50% (v/v) binary solvent yields an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.72% for 300 cycles in Cu||Na cell cycling. Remarkably, at a C/2 cycling rate, Na||Na symmetric cell cycling demonstrates ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability exceeding 7000 h, and full cells with Na0.44MnO2 as a cathode retain 80% of their capacity after 500 cycles. This study systematically examines solvation structure, SEI layer composition, and electrochemical cycling, emphasizing the significance of MTHF&#8208;based binary solvent mixtures for high&#8208;performance SMBs.

         <title>Mechanically and Thermally Robust Gel Electrolytes Built from A Charged Double Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating lithium salt and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) into a rigid&#8208;rod nanofibrillar polymer matrix forms a gel polymer electrolyte that has superior thermomechanical properties over poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), even when incorporating only 8% rigid&#8208;rod polymer. Lithium metal battery testing shows reversible cycling between discharging at ambient temperature and charging at 80&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C, enabling fast recharging and reduced thermal management for, e.g., electric vehicle batteries.








Abstract
Polymer electrolytes have received tremendous interest in the development of solid&#8208;state batteries, but often fall short in one or more key properties required for practical applications. Herein, a rigid gel polymer electrolyte prepared by immobilizing a liquid mixture of a lithium salt and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether with only 8 wt% poly(2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) is reported. The high charge density and rigid double helical structure of PBDT lead to formation of a nanofibrillar structure that endows this electrolyte with stronger mechanical properties, wider temperature window, and higher battery rate capability compared to all other poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. The ion transport mechanism in this rigid polymer electrolyte is systematically studied using multiple complementary techniques. Li/LiFePO4 cells show excellent capacity retention over long&#8208;term cycling, with thermal cycling reversibility between ambient temperature and elevated temperatures, demonstrating compelling potential for solid&#8208;state batteries targeting fast charging at high temperatures and slower discharging at ambient temperature.

         <title>Prevented Cell Clusters&#8217; Migration Via Microdot Biomaterials for Inhibiting Scar Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microdot biomaterial system is constructed using &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles for inhibiting adhesion of injured tendon. By slowly releasing mitochondria&#8208;targeted functional polypeptides and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents in an inflammatory environment to promote the inflow of extracellular Ca2+, they can inhibit the N&#8208;cadherin expression and promote fibroblast apoptosis, synergistically inhibiting adhesion of injured tendons.








Abstract
Cluster&#8208;like collective cell migration of fibroblasts is one of the main factors of adhesion in injured tissues. In this research, a microdot biomaterial system is constructed using &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles, which are prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;amino acids&#8208;N&#8208;carboxylic anhydrides (NCAs) and lactide, respectively. The microdot biomaterial system slowly releases functionalized polypeptides targeting mitochondria and promoting the influx of extracellular calcium ions under the inflammatory environment, thus inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin mediating cell&#8211;cell interaction, and promoting apoptosis of cluster fibroblasts, synergistically inhibiting the migration of fibroblast clusters at the site of tendon injury. Meanwhile, the anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles are celecoxib (Cex) solubilized by PEG/polyester, which can improve the inflammatory microenvironment at the injury site for a long time. In vitro, the microdot biomaterial system can effectively inhibit the migration of the cluster fibroblasts by inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin between cell&#8211;cell and promoting apoptosis. In vivo, the microdot biomaterial system can promote apoptosis while achieving long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;inflammation effects, and reduce the expression of vimentin and &#945;&#8208;smooth muscle actin (&#945;&#8208;SMA)&#160;in fibroblasts. Thus, this microdot biomaterial system provides new ideas for the prevention and treatment of tendon adhesion by inhibiting the cluster migration of fibroblasts.

         <title>Insect&#8208;Scale Biped Robots Based on Asymmetrical Friction Effect Induced by Magnetic Torque</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locomotion mechanism for magnetic robots based on asymmetrical friction effect induced by magnetic torque has been revealed and defined. A biped robot based on the mechanism is proposed, which not only exhibits rapid locomotion across substrates with varying friction coefficients but also achieves precise motions along patterned trajectories through programmed controlling.








Abstract
Multimodal and controllable locomotion in complex terrain is of great importance for practical applications of insect&#8208;scale robots. Robust locomotion plays a particularly critical role. In this study, a locomotion mechanism for magnetic robots based on asymmetrical friction effect induced by magnetic torque is revealed and defined. The defined mechanism overcomes the design constraints imposed by both robot and substrate structures, enabling the realization of multimodal locomotion on complex terrains. Drawing inspiration from human walking and running locomotion, a biped robot based on the mechanism is proposed, which not only exhibits rapid locomotion across substrates with varying friction coefficients but also achieves precise locomotion along patterned trajectories through programmed controlling. Furthermore, apart from its exceptional locomotive capabilities, the biped robot demonstrates remarkable robustness in terms of load&#8208;carrying and weight&#8208;bearing performance. The presented locomotion and mechanism herein introduce a novel concept for designing magnetic robots while offering extensive possibilities for practical applications in insect&#8208;scale robotics.

         <title>In&#8208;Operando Spatiotemporal Imaging of Coupled Film&#8208;Substrate Elastodynamics During an Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising coherently coupled elastodynamics is observed between a VO2 film exhibiting an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition (IMT) and a TiO2 substrate that &#160; also exhibits an IMT&#8208;like response in a micrometers deep surface layer, reveals by spatiotemporal X&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy. Phase&#8208;field model points to native oxygen vacancy defects that respond to electric fields, a promising direction for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The drive toward non&#8208;von Neumann device architectures has led to an intense focus on insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal (IMT) and the converse metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator (MIT) transitions. Studies of electric field&#8208;driven IMT in the prototypical VO2 thin&#8208;film channel devices are largely focused on the electrical and elastic responses of the films, but the response of the corresponding TiO2 substrate is often overlooked, since it is nominally expected to be electrically passive and elastically rigid. Here, in&#8208;operando spatiotemporal imaging of the coupled elastodynamics using X&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy of a VO2 film channel device on TiO2 substrate reveals two new surprises. First, the film channel bulges during the IMT, the opposite of the expected shrinking in the film undergoing IMT. Second, a microns thick proximal layer in the substrate also coherently bulges accompanying the IMT in the film, which is completely unexpected. Phase&#8208;field simulations of coupled IMT, oxygen vacancy electronic dynamics, and electronic carrier diffusion incorporating thermal and strain effects suggest that the observed elastodynamics can be explained by the known naturally occurring oxygen vacancies that rapidly ionize (and deionize) in concert with the IMT (MIT). Fast electrical&#8208;triggering of the IMT via ionizing defects and an active &#8220;IMT&#8208;like&#8221; substrate layer are critical aspects to consider in device applications.

         <title>Reduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Bis(hydroxymethyl)Furan at High Current Density using a Ga&#8208;Doped AgCu:Cationomer Hybrid Electrocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals is of interest for the production of biofuels and chemicals. A direct electroreduction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) has been developed using a hybrid catalyst. The utilization of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationomer achieves a BHMF faradaic efficiency (FE) of 58% at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a production rate of 1&#160;mmol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogenation of biomass-derived chemicals is of interest for the production of biofuels and chemicals. A direct electroreduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) has been developed using a hybrid catalyst. The utilization of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationomer achieves a BHMF faradaic efficiency (FE) of 58% at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a production rate of 1&#160;mmol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Facile Access to High Solid Content Monodispersed Microspheres via Dual&#8208;Component Surfactants Regulation toward High&#8208;Performance Colloidal Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;surfactants&#8208;mediated emulsion polymerization mechanism is proposed, where anionic and nonionic surfactants are employed due to their synergistic effect to guarantee the electrostatic and steric dual&#8208;stabilization balance. Thus, 55&#160;wt% high solid content poly(styrene&#8208;butyl acrylate&#8208;methacrylic acid) monodispersed colloidal latex is achieved, which can be used to construct metamaterials toward photoluminescence enhancement and passive cooling coatings.








Abstract
Monodispersed microspheres play a major role in optical science and engineering, providing ideal building blocks for structural color materials. However, the method toward high solid content (HSC) monodispersed microspheres has remained a key hurdle. Herein, a facile access to harvest monodispersed microspheres based on the emulsion polymerization mechanism is demonstrated, where anionic and nonionic surfactants are employed to achieve the electrostatic and steric dual&#8208;stabilization balance in a synergistic manner. Monodispersed poly(styrene&#8208;butyl acrylate&#8208;methacrylic acid) colloidal latex with 55&#160;wt% HSC is achieved, which shows an enhanced self&#8208;assembly efficiency of 280% compared with the low solid content (10&#160;wt%) latex. In addition, Ag&#8208;coated colloidal photonic crystal (Ag@CPC) coating with near&#8208;zero refractive index is achieved, presenting the characteristics of metamaterials. And an 11&#8208;fold photoluminescence emission enhancement of CdSe@ZnS quantum dots is realized by the Ag@CPC metamaterial coating. Taking advantage of high assembly efficiency, easily large&#8208;scale film&#8208;forming of the 55&#160;wt% HSC microspheres latex, robust Ag@CPC metamaterial coatings could be easily produced for passive cooling. The coating demonstrates excellent thermal insulation performance with theoretical cooling power of 30.4&#160;W m&#8722;2, providing practical significance for scalable CPC architecture coatings in passive cooling.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Atomic Order on Double&#8208;Stepped Al2O3(0001) Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely well&#8208;ordered surface is obtained by annealing sapphire (0001) substrates at ultrahigh temperatures. Electron diffraction reveals micrometer&#8208;scale atomic order on these surfaces. This order opens new avenues for engineering thin&#8208;film quality and harnessing the unique properties of advanced materials. A highly advantageous combination of material properties &#8208; ionic bonding character, high&#8208;temperature stability, and polar step edges &#8208; underlies the observed order.








Abstract
The deterministic preparation of highly ordered single&#8208;crystalline surfaces is a key step for studying and utilizing the physical properties of various advanced materials. This paper presents the fast and straightforward preparation of vicinal Al2O3(0001) surfaces with micrometer&#8208;scale atomic order. Crisp electron&#8208;diffraction spots up to at least 20th order evidence atomic coherence on terraces with widths exceeding 1 &#956;m. The unique combination of three properties of Al2O3(0001) underlie this remarkable coherence: its high&#8208;temperature stability; the differences in the ionic bonding systems of the surface as compared to the bulk; and the fact that the terraces are non&#8208;polar whereas the step edges have a polar character. The step edges are furthermore found to have alternating configurations, which drive a step&#8208;doubling transition. On double&#8208;stepped surfaces, the Al&#8208;rich (31&#215;31)R&#177;9$(\sqrt {31}\times \sqrt {31})\textrm {R}\pm 9$&#176; surface reconstruction attains a singular in&#8208;plane orientation. These results set a benchmark for high&#8208;quality surface preparation and thus expand the scope for both fundamental studies on and the technological utilization of exciting material&#160;systems.

         <title>Dynamic Acoustic Beamshaping with Coupling&#8208;Immune Moir&#233; Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling&#8208;immune acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces are proposed by leveraging the interlayer coupling from propagating waves. Remote acoustic moir&#233; effects are theoretically and experimentally validated to be decoupled from the interlayer distance. The dynamic shaping of acoustic beams and vortices is successfully achieved, facilitating twisted moir&#233; devices of practical applications in remote dynamic detection and multiplexed underwater acoustic communication.








Abstract
Moir&#233; effects arising from mutually twisted metasurfaces have showcased remarkable wave manipulation capabilities, unveiling tantalizing emerging phenomena such as acoustic moir&#233; flat bands and topological phase transitions. However, the pursuit of strong near&#8208;field coupling in layers has necessitated acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces to be tightly stacked at narrow distances in the subwavelength range. Here, moir&#233; effects beyond near&#8208;field interlayer coupling in acoustics are reported and the concept of coupling&#8208;immune moir&#233; metasurfaces is proposed. Remote acoustic moir&#233; effects decoupled from the interlayer distance are theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrated. Tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane acoustic beam scanning is successfully achieved by dynamically controlling twist angles. The engineered coupling&#8208;immune properties are further extended to multilayered acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces and manipulation of acoustic vortices. Good robustness against external disturbances is also observed for the fabricated coupling&#8208;immune acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces. The presented work unlocks the potential of twisted moir&#233; devices for out&#8208;of&#8208;plane acoustic beam shaping, enabling practical applications in remote dynamic detection, and multiplexed underwater acoustic communication.

         <title>Anchoring Active Li Metal in Oriented Channel by In Situ Formed Nucleation Sites Enabling Durable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertical carbon vascular tissue preinstalled CoSe nanoparticles (VCVT/CoSe) host is designed for dendrite&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries. This Li host provides speedy Li+ transport channels and abundant lithiophilic sites guiding Li deposition behavior with uniform morphology, which ensure stable cycling capability over 3000 h and high&#8208;capacity retention of 81.7% after 300 cycles in full&#8208;cell paired with a nickel&#8208;rich cathode.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the ultimate anode material for pursuing the increased energy density of rechargeable batteries. However, fatal dendrites growth and huge volume change seriously hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, a lithium host that preinstalled CoSe nanoparticles on vertical carbon vascular tissues (VCVT/CoSe) is designed and fabricated to resolve these issues, which provides sufficient Li plating space with a robust framework, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition. Their inherent N sites coupled with the in situ formed lithiophilic Co sites loaded at the interface of VCVT not only anchor the initial Li nucleation seeds but also accelerate the Li+ transport kinetics. Meanwhile, the Li2Se originated from the CoSe conversion contributes to constructing a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with high ionic conductivity. This optimized Li/VCVT/CoSe composite anode exhibits a prominent long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000&#160;h with a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. When paired with a commercial nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathode, the full&#8208;cell presents substantially enhanced cycling performance with 81.7% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.2 C. Thus, this work reveals the critical role of guiding Li deposition behavior to maintain homogeneous Li morphology and pave the way to stable LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;A vertical carbon vascular tissue preinstalled CoSe nanoparticles (VCVT/CoSe) host is designed for dendrite-free Li-metal batteries. This Li host provides speedy Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channels and abundant lithiophilic sites guiding Li deposition behavior with uniform morphology, which ensure stable cycling capability over 3000 h and high-capacity retention of 81.7% after 300 cycles in full-cell paired with a nickel-rich cathode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal is the ultimate anode material for pursuing the increased energy density of rechargeable batteries. However, fatal dendrites growth and huge volume change seriously hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, a lithium host that preinstalled CoSe nanoparticles on vertical carbon vascular tissues (VCVT/CoSe) is designed and fabricated to resolve these issues, which provides sufficient Li plating space with a robust framework, enabling dendrite-free Li deposition. Their inherent N sites coupled with the in situ formed lithiophilic Co sites loaded at the interface of VCVT not only anchor the initial Li nucleation seeds but also accelerate the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport kinetics. Meanwhile, the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se originated from the CoSe conversion contributes to constructing a stable solid-electrolyte interphase with high ionic conductivity. This optimized Li/VCVT/CoSe composite anode exhibits a prominent long-term cycling stability over 3000&#160;h with a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. When paired with a commercial nickel-rich LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, the full-cell presents substantially enhanced cycling performance with 81.7% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.2 C. Thus, this work reveals the critical role of guiding Li deposition behavior to maintain homogeneous Li morphology and pave the way to stable LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Single&#8208;Mode Random Lasing of Tin Halide Perovskites Integrated in a Vertical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the tuning of the Random Lasing (RL) characteristics in spin&#8208;coated and inkjet&#8208;printed tin&#8208;based perovskites integrated into a vertical cavity. When the cavity mode is resonant with the photoluminescence (PL) peak energy, standard vertical lasing is observed, while single&#8208;mode RL is obtained if the cavity mode lies above the PL peak energy.








Abstract
The development of random lasing (RL) with predictable and controlled properties is an important step to make these cheap optical sources stable and reliable. However, the design of tailored RL characteristics (emission energy, threshold, number of modes) is only obtained with complex photonic structures, while the simplest optical configurations able to tune the RL are still a challenge. This work demonstrates the tuning of the RL characteristics in spin&#8208;coated and inkjet&#8208;printed tin&#8208;based perovskites integrated into a vertical cavity with low quality factor. When the cavity mode is resonant with the photoluminescence (PL) peak energy, standard vertical lasing is observed. More importantly, single mode RL operation with the lowest threshold and a quality factor as high as 1&#160;000 (twenty times the quality factor of the resonator) is obtained if the cavity mode lies above the PL peak energy due to higher gain. These results can have important technological implications toward the development of low&#8208;cost RL sources without chaotic behavior.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Microsensors Inspired by Noctiluca Scintillans for Small&#8208;Defect Positioning and Electrical&#8208;Stress Visualization in Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a novel self&#8208;reporting microsensor (SRM) inspired by noctiluca scintillans for addressing the critical need to visualize small defects and electrical stress in dielectric polymers. The SRM couples nearby electric field energy to emit measurable fluorescence, presenting a distinct distribution of invisible electric field in polymers for the first time.








Abstract
Small defects induce concentrated electrical stress in dielectric polymers, leading to premature failure of materials. Existing sensing methods fail to effectively visualize these defects owing to the invisible&#8208;energy state of the electric field. Thus, it is necessary to establish a nondestructive method for the real&#8208;time detection of small defects in dielectric polymers. In this study, a self&#8208;reporting microsensor (SRM) inspired by Noctiluca scintillans is designed to endow materials with the ability of self&#8208;detection for defects and electrical stress. The SRM leverages the energy of a nearby electric field to emit measurable fluorescence, enabling defect localization and diagnosis as well as electrical&#8208;stress visualization. A controllable dielectric microsphere is constructed to achieve an adjustable electroluminescence threshold for the SRM, thereby increasing its detection accuracy while decreasing the electroluminescence threshold. The potential degradation in the polymer performance owing to SRM implantation is addressed by assembling long molecular chains on the SRM surface to spontaneously generate an interpenetrating network. Results of finite element analyses and experiments demonstrate that the SRM can effectively realize nondestructive visualization and positioning of small defects and concentrated electrical stress in polymers, positioning it as a promising sensing method for monitoring the electric field and charge distribution in materials.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Ultrathin Perfect Absorber for High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the cornea of the compound crab eye, an ultrathin perfect absorber with strong light&#8208;absorption and mechanical stability is proposed. A strong absorption (87%) is realized at subwavelength cross&#8208;section thickness (1/20 of the wavelength), which enables high&#8208;temperature hot&#8208;electron pumping. The absorber is promising for applications in advanced energy, catalysis, and photodetection.








Abstract
Ultrathin perfect absorber (UPA) enables efficient photothermal conversion (PC) in renewable chemical and energy systems. However, it is challenging so far to obtain efficient absorption with thickness significantly less than the wavelength, especially considering the common view that an ultrathin film can absorb at most 50% of incident light. Here, a highly light&#8208;absorbing and mechanically stable UPA is reported by learning from the honeycomb mirror design of the crab compound eyes. With the hollow apertures enclosed by the self&#8208;supporting ultrathin film of reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles, the absorber achieves spoof&#8208;plasmon enhanced broadband absorption in solar spectrum and low radiative decay in infrared. Specifically, a strong absorption (87%) is realized by the apertures with cross&#8208;section thickness of 1/20 of the wavelength, which is 7.3 times stronger than a planar counterpart with the identical material. Its high PC efficiency up to 64%, with hot&#8208;electron temperature as high as 2344&#8201;K, is also experimentally demonstrated. Utilizing its low thermal mass nature, a high&#8208;speed visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared converter is constructed. The absorber can enable high&#8208;performance PC processes for future interfacial catalysis and photon&#8208;detection.

         <title>Visualizing Nanoscale Interlayer Magnetic Interactions and Unconventional Low&#8208;Frequency Behaviors in Ferromagnetic Multishelled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multishelled ferromagnetic material with controllable shell numbers is presented. By strategically regulating the nanoscale intershell magnetic interactions, the magnetic properties of each shell are fine&#8208;tuned. This approach has revealed distinctive magnetic characteristics including regulated magnetic domain configurations and enhanced effective fields. The unique magnetic coupling markedly improves electromagnetic absorption for fifth&#8208;generation frequencies.








Abstract
Precise manipulation of van der Waals forces within 2D atomic layers allows for exact control over electron&#8211;phonon coupling, leading to the exceptional quantum properties. However, applying this technique to diverse structures such as 3D materials is challenging. Therefore, investigating new hierarchical structures and different interlayer forces is crucial for overcoming these limitations and discovering novel physical properties. In this work, a multishelled ferromagnetic material with controllable shell numbers is developed. By strategically regulating the magnetic interactions between these shells, the magnetic properties of each shell are fine&#8208;tuned. This approach reveals distinctive magnetic characteristics including regulated magnetic domain configurations and enhanced effective fields. The nanoscale magnetic interactions between the shells are observed and analyzed, which shed light on the modified magnetic properties of each shell, enhancing the understanding and control of ferromagnetic materials. The distinctive magnetic interaction significantly boosts electromagnetic absorption at low&#8208;frequency frequencies used by fifth&#8208;generation wireless devices, outperforming ferromagnetic materials without multilayer structures by several folds. The application of magnetic interactions in materials science reveals thrilling prospects for technological and electronic innovation.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Temperature Operated Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Stabilized by Thermal Barrier for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The in situ engineered thermal barrier BaZrO3 layer and Zr ions doping for NCM811 cathode in this work, not only reveal a facile and practicable strategy for accelerating the large&#8208;scale commercial application through enhancing the structure and electrochemical stabilities under high operation temperature, but also provide guidance for the modification of various energy conversion and storage materials.








Abstract
The pursuit of high energy density batteries has expedited the fast development of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. However, the chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation induced by local thermal accumulation and anisotropic lattice strain is posing great obstacles for its wide applications. Herein, a highly&#8208;antioxidative BaZrO3 thermal barrier engineered LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode through an in situ construction strategy is first reported to circumvent the above issues. It is found that the Zr ions are incorporated to Ni&#8208;rich material lattice and influence on the topotactic lithiation as well as enhance the oxygen electronegativity through the rigid Zr&#9472;O bonds, which effectively alleviates the lattice strain propagation and decreases the excessive oxidization of lattice oxygen for charge compensation. More importantly, the BaZrO3 thermal barrier with an ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity validly impedes the fast heat exchange between electrode and electrolyte to mitigate the severe surface side reactions. This helps an ultra&#8208;high mass loading Li&#8208;ion pouch cell deliver a specific energy density of 690&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at active material level and an excellent capacity retention of 92.5% after 1400 cycles under 1 C at 25&#160;&#176;C. Tested at a high temperature of 55&#160;&#176;C, the pouch type full&#8208;cell also exhibits 88.7% in capacity retention after 1200 cycles.

         <title>Unveiling the Synergistic Role of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated Ni/NiOx Photothermal Cocatalyst for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density oxygen (VO) and nickel (VNi) vacancies are formed at the interface of Ni/NiOx encapsulated in graphitized carbon (Ni/NiOx@C) due to the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during polycrystalline annealing. These vacancies establish highly active frustrated Lewis pairs, which significantly enhance the processes of water adsorption and dissociation. Moreover, the defect&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in Ni/NiOx@C facilitates efficient photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen production.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;density and closely spaced frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) is crucial for enhancing catalyst activity and accelerating reaction rates. However, constructing efficient FLPs by breaking classical Lewis bonds poses a significant challenge. Here, this work has made a pivotal discovery regarding the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during the formation of grain boundaries in carbon&#8208;encapsulated Ni/NiOx (Ni/NiOx@C). This effect facilitates the formation of high&#8208;density O (VO) and Ni (VNi) vacancy sites with different charge polarities, specifically FLP&#8208;VO&#8208;C basic sites and FLP&#8208;VNi&#8208;C acidic sites. The synergistic interaction between FLP&#8208;VO&#8208;C and FLP&#8208;VNi&#8208;C sites not only reduces energy barriers for water adsorption and splitting, but also induces a strong photothermal effect. This mutually reinforcing effect contributes to the exceptional performance of Ni/NiOx@C as a cocatalyst in photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen production. Notably, the Ni/NiOx@C/g&#8208;C3N4 (NOCC) composite photocatalyst exhibits remarkable hydrogen production activity with a rate of 10.7 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing that of the Pt cocatalyst by 1.76 times. Moreover, the NOCC achieves an impressive apparent quantum yield of 40.78% at a wavelength of 380&#160;nm. This work paves the way for designing novel defect&#8208;state multiphase cocatalysts with high&#8208;density and adjacent FLP sites, which hold promise for enhancing various catalytic reactions.

         <title>Electrostatic Smart Textiles for Braille&#8208;To&#8208;Speech Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new type of Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system that employs dual&#8208;functional electrostatic transducers constructed from fabric&#8208;based materials. Assisted by a machine learning algorithm, it is possible to translate the Braille alphabet and 40 commonly used words (extensible) into speech with an accuracy of 99.09% and 97.08%, respectively.








Abstract
A wearable Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system is of great importance for providing auditory feedback in assisting blind people and people with speech impairment. However, previous reported Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation systems still need to be improved in terms of comfortability or integration. Here, a Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system that uses dual&#8208;functional electrostatic transducers which are made of fabric&#8208;based materials and can be integrated into textiles is reported. Based on electrostatic induction, the electrostatic transducer can either serve as a tactile sensor or a loudspeaker with the same design. The proposed electrostatic transducers have excellent output performances, mechanical robustness, and working stability. By combining the devices with machine learning algorithms, it is possible to translate the Braille alphabet and 40 commonly used words (extensible) into speech with an accuracy of 99.09% and 97.08%, respectively. This work demonstrates a new approach for further developments of advanced assistive technology toward improving the lives of disabled people.

         <title>Top&#8208;Down Induced Crystallization Orientation toward Highly Efficient p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down engineering strategy of perovskite crystallization is introduced via propylamine chloride (PACl) post treatment of perovskite wet film, inducing downward preferred crystallization orientation and realizing excellent homogeneity in terms of vertical and horizontal scale of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 25.07% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PVSCs, as well as the enhanced thermal and operational stability.









Abstract
Crystallization orientation plays a crucial role in determining the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), whereas effective strategies for realizing oriented perovskite crystallization is still lacking. Herein, a facile and efficient top&#8208;down strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization orientation via treating perovskite wet film with propylamine chloride (PACl) before annealing. The PA+ ions tend to be adsorbed on the (001) facet of the perovskite surface, resulting in the reduced cleavage energy to induce (001) orientation&#8208;dominated growth of perovskite film and then reduce the temperature of phase transition, meanwhile, the penetrating Cl ions further regulate the crystallization process. As&#8208;prepared (001)&#8208;dominant perovskite films exhibit the ameliorative film homogeneity in terms of vertical and horizontal scale, leading to alleviated lattice mismatch and lowered defect density. The resultant PVSC devices deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.07% with enhanced stability, and the unencapsulated PVSC device maintains 95% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of operation at the maximum power point under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

A rational design strategy is proposed to achieve freestanding serpentine silicon strips with ultrahigh stretchability over 300%. The strips exhibit excellent stability and durability, and can keep conformal contact with the skin. Combined with the mature processing techniques and excellent semiconductor properties of silicon, freestanding serpentine silicon strips hold promise as core stretchable electronic materials for wearable electronics.








Abstract
Well&#8208;functionalized electronic materials, such as silicon, in a stretchable format are desirable for high&#8208;performance wearable electronics. However, obtaining Si materials that meet the required stretchability of over 100% for wearable applications remains a significant challenge. Herein, a rational design strategy is proposed to achieve freestanding serpentine Si strips (FS&#8208;Si strips) with ultrahigh stretchability, fulfilling wearable requirements. The self&#8208;supporting feature makes the strips get rid of excessive constraints from substrates and enables them to deform with the minimum strain energy. Micrometer&#8208;scale thicknesses enhance robustness, and large diameter&#8208;to&#8208;width ratios effectively reduce strain concentration. Consequently, the FS&#8208;Si strips with the optimum design could withstand 300% stretch, bending, and torsion without fracturing, even under rough manual operation. They also exhibit excellent stability and durability over 50,000 cycles of 100% stretching cycles. For wearable applications, the FS&#8208;Si strips can maintain conformal contact with the skin and have a maximum stretchability of 120%. Moreover, they are electrically insensitive to large deformations, which ensure signal stability during their daily use. Combined with mature processing techniques and the excellent semiconductor properties of Si, FS&#8208;Si strips are promising core stretchable electronic materials for wearable electronics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Photosensitizer Synergy Empowers Ambient Light Photoactivation of Indium Oxide for High&#8208;Performance NO2 Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of interface chemistry of Au&#8208;BixIn2&#8208;xO3 in green&#8208;light&#8208;activated NO2 sensing is systematically investigated. The synergistic interplay between Bi dopants and Au nanoparticles is the key to photosensitizing In2O3 to visible light, significantly reinforcing sensitivity and reversibility at ambient conditions. This meticulous study provides an understanding of the photoactivation mechanism mediated by two dissimilar photosensitizers.








Abstract
Light&#8208;activated chemiresistors offer a powerful approach to achieving lower&#8208;temperature gas sensing with unprecedented sensitivities. However, an incomplete understanding of how photoexcited charge carriers enhance sensitivity obstructs the rational design of high&#8208;performance sensors, impeding the practical utilization under commonly accessible light sources instead of ultraviolet&#160;or higher&#8208;energy sources. Here, a rational approach is presented to modulate the electronic properties of the parent metal oxide phase, exemplified by this model system of Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 nanofibers decorated with Au nanoparticles (NPs) that exhibit superior NO2 sensing performance. Bi doping introduces mid&#8208;gap energy levels into In2O3, promoting photoactivation even under visible blue light. Additionally, green&#8208;absorbing plasmonic Au NPs facilitate electron transfer across the heterojunction, extending the photoactive region toward the green light. It is revealed that the direct involvement of photogenerated charge carriers in gas adsorption and desorption processes is pivotal for enhancing gas sensing performance. Owing to the synergistic interplay between the Bi dopants and the Au NPs, the Au&#8208;BixIn2&#8208;xO3 (x&#160;=&#160;0.04) sensing layers attain impressive response values (Rg/Ra&#160;=&#160;104 at 0.6&#160;ppm NO2) under green light illumination and demonstrate practical viability through evaluation under simulated mixed&#8208;light conditions, all of which significantly outperforms previously reported visible light&#8208;activated NO2 sensors.

         <title>Overcoming the Incompatibility Between Electrical Conductivity and Electromagnetic Transmissivity: A Graphene Glass Fiber Fabric Design Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene glass fiber fabric is innovatively fabricated through the first&#8208;developed decoupling chemical vapor deposition growth strategy to controllably prepare high&#8208;quality, layer&#8208;limited graphene on the non&#8208;catalytic nonmetallic GFF, through which the desired compatibility of electrical conductivity and EM transmissivity can be realized; thus, helping get rid of the electrical conductivity&#8211;electromagnetic transmissivity&#8208;incompatible dilemma suffered by conventional conductive materials effectively.








Abstract
Conventional conductive materials such as metals are crucial functional components of conductive systems in diverse electronic instruments. However, their severe intrinsic impedance mismatch with air dielectric causes strong reflection of incident electromagnetic waves, and the resulting low electromagnetic transmissivity typically interferes with surrounding electromagnetic signal communications in modern multifunction&#8208;integrated instruments. Herein, graphene glass fiber fabric (GGFF) that merges intrinsic electrical and electromagnetic properties of graphene with dielectric attributes and highly porous macrostructure of glass fiber fabric (GFF) is innovatively developed. Using a novel decoupling chemical vapor deposition growth strategy, high&#8208;quality and layer&#8208;limited graphene is prepared on noncatalytic nonmetallic GFF in a controlled manner; this is pivotal to realizing GGFF with the desired compatibility among high conductivity, low electromagnetic reflectivity, and high electromagnetic transmissivity. At the same sheet resistance over a wide range of values (250&#8211;3000 &#937;&#183;sq&#8722;1), the GGFF exhibits significantly lower electromagnetic reflectivity (by 0.42&#8211;0.51) and higher transmissivity (by 0.27&#8211;0.62) than those of its metal&#8208;based conductive counterpart (CuGFF). The material design strategy reported herein provides a constructive solution to eliminate the incompatibility between electrical conductivity and electromagnetic transmissivity faced by conventional conductive materials, spotlighting the applicability of GGFF in electric heating scenarios in radar, antenna, and stealth systems.

         <title>Noncentrosymmetric Triangular Magnet CaMnTeO6: Strong Quantum Fluctuations and Role of s0 versus s2 Electronic States in Competing Exchange Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates a framework to design triangular magnets with atomically precise control of competing intralayer and interlayer magnetic exchange interactions. Careful considerations of isotope purity, nuclear and electronic spins, lattice symmetry, frontier orbitals, and electronic states for CaMnTeO6 result in the realization of strong quantum fluctuations. This provides a powerful tool for enhancing coherent quantum dynamics in real materials.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric triangular magnets offer a unique platform for realizing strong quantum fluctuations. However, designing these quantum materials remains an open challenge attributable to a knowledge gap in the tunability of competing exchange interactions at the atomic level. Here, a new noncentrosymmetric triangular S&#160;=&#160;3/2 magnet CaMnTeO6 is created based on careful chemical and physical considerations. The model material displays competing magnetic interactions and features nonlinear optical responses with the capability of generating coherent photons. The incommensurate magnetic ground state of CaMnTeO6 with an unusually large spin rotation angle of 127&#176;(1) indicates that the anisotropic interlayer exchange is strong and competing with the isotropic interlayer Heisenberg interaction. The moment of 1.39(1)&#160;&#181;B, extracted from low&#8208;temperature heat capacity and neutron diffraction measurements, is only 46% of the expected value of the static moment 3&#160;&#181;B. This reduction indicates the presence of strong quantum fluctuations in the half&#8208;integer spin S&#160;=&#160;3/2 CaMnTeO6 magnet, which is rare. By comparing the spin&#8208;polarized band structure, chemical bonding, and physical properties of AMnTeO6 (A&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Pb), how quantum&#8208;chemical interpretation can illuminate insights into the fundamentals of magnetic exchange interactions, providing a powerful tool for modulating spin dynamics with atomically precise control is demonstrated.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;Synthesized Surfactant&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based NO2 Sensors: Unprecedentedly High Sensitivity and Fast Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NO2 chemical sensors using aerosol&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes demonstrate unprecedently high sensitivity, ultrafast response/recovery, and low limit of detection. This is owing to the surfactant&#8208;free and high quality of the carbon nanotubes in terms of the tube diameter uniformity, tube length, bundling, and defect density. Solvent&#8208;free one&#8208;step facile lamination and industrial viability of the nanotube film is an added benefit.








Abstract
This study pioneers a chemical sensor based on surfactant&#8208;free aerosol&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films for detecting nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Unlike conventional CNTs, the SWCNTs used in this study exhibit one of the highest surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios. They show minimal bundling without the need for surfactants and have the lowest number of defects among reported CNTs. Furthermore, the dry&#8208;transferrable and facile one&#8208;step lamination results&#160;in promising industrial viability. When applied to devices, the sensor shows excellent sensitivity (41.6% at 500&#160;ppb), rapid response/recovery time (14.2/120.8&#160;s), a remarkably low limit of detection (below &#8776;0.161&#160;ppb), minimal noise, repeatability for more than 50 cycles without fluctuation, and long&#8208;term stability for longer than 6&#160;months. This is the best performance reported for a pure CNT&#8208;based sensor. In addition, the aerosol SWCNTs demonstrate consistent gas&#8208;sensing performance even after 5000 bending cycles, indicating their suitability for wearable applications. Based on experimental and theoretical analyses, the proposed aerosol CNTs are expected to overcome the limitations associated with conventional CNT&#8208;based sensors, thereby offering a promising avenue for various sensor applications.

         <title>Suppressing Ion Migration by Synergistic Engineering of Anion and Cation toward High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synergistic effect of dimethylammonium and trifluoroacetate, the perovskite solar cells and modules with DMATFA deliver a promising power conversion efficiency of 25.03% (certified 24.65%, 0.1 cm2) and 20.58% (63.74 cm2), respectively. The modified device demonstrates excellent operational stability by maintaining 91% of its initial efficiency after 1520 h of maximum power point continuous tracking.









Abstract
Ion migration&#8208;induced intrinsic instability and large&#8208;area fabrication pose a tough challenge for the commercial deployment of perovskite photovoltaics. Herein, an interface heterojunction and metal electrode stabilization strategy is developed by suppressing ion migration via managing lead&#8208;based imperfections. After screening a series of cations and nonhalide anions, the ideal organic salt molecule dimethylammonium trifluoroacetate (DMATFA) consisting of dimethylammonium (DMA+) cation and trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) anion is selected to manipulate the surface of perovskite films. DMA+ enables the conversion of active excess and/or unreacted PbI2 into stable new phase DMAPbI3, inhibiting photodecomposition of PbI2 and ion migration. Meanwhile, TFA&#8722; can suppress iodide ion migration through passivating undercoordinated Pb2+ and/or iodide vacancies. DMA+ and TFA&#8722; synergistically stabilize the heterojunction interface and silver electrode. The DMATFA&#8208;treated inverted perovskite solar cells and modules achieve a maximum efficiency of 25.03% (certified 24.65%, 0.1 cm2) and 20.58% (63.74 cm2), respectively, which is the record efficiency ever reported for the devices based on vacuum flash evaporation technology. The DMATFA modification results in outstanding operational stability, as evidenced by maintaining 91% of its original efficiency after 1520 h of maximum power point continuous tracking.

         <title>Spacer Conformation Induced Multiple Hydrogen Bonds in 2D Perovskite toward Highly Efficient Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>

Interlayer&#8208;spacer conformation induces multiple hydrogen bonds in new 2D DJ perovskite toward highly efficient optoelectronic devices with exceptional sensitivity to UV and X&#8208;ray photons, while also demonstrating excellent applicability for UV weak&#8208;light imaging.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites typically outperform Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) analogs in terms of photodetection (PD). However, the mechanism behind this enhanced performance remains elusive. Theoretical calculations for elucidating interlayer spacer conformation&#8208;induced multiple hydrogen bonds in 2D perovskite are presented, along with the synthesis of DPAPbBr4 (DPB) single crystals (SCs) and their PD properties under X&#8208;ray/ultraviolet (UV) excitation. The high&#8208;quality DPB SC enhances PD with exceptional photoresponse attributes, including a high on/off ratio (4.89&#160;&#215;&#160;104), high responsivity (2.44 A&#160;W&#8315;1), along with large dynamic linear range (154 dB) and low detection limit (7.1 nW&#160;cm&#8315;2), which are currently the best results among 2D perovskite SC detectors, respectively. Importantly, high&#8208;resolution images are obtained under UV illumination with weak light levels. The SC X&#8208;ray detector exhibits a high sensitivity of 663 &#181;C Gyair&#8315;1 cm&#8211;2 at 10 V and a detection limit of 1.44 &#181;Gyair s&#8315;1. This study explores 2D DJ perovskites for efficient and innovative optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Anomalous Detachment Behavior and Directional Reconstruction Regulation of Leaching&#8208;Type Precatalysts for Industrial Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New reconstruction mechanisms and anomalous detachment behaviors of leaching&#8208;type oxygen&#8208;evolving precatalysts under industrial conditions are uncovered, different from the reported results obtained under traditional laboratory conditions. A targeted reconstruction via gradient test strategy is proposed to effectively solve the detachment issue. Dual&#8208;site regulation enables the reconstructed catalyst with high performance in a realistic electrolyzer.








Abstract
Current reconstruction chemistry studies are mainly operated at the laboratory scale, where the operating parameters are different from those used in industrial water electrolyzers. This gap leads to unclear reconstruction behaviors under industrial conditions and constrains the application of catalysts. Here, this work presents a new reconstruction mechanism and anomalous detachment phenomena observed in leaching&#8208;type oxygen&#8208;evolving precatalysts under industrial conditions, different from the reported results obtained under laboratory conditions. The identified detachment issues are closely linked to the production of a potassium salt separate phase, which proves sensitive to the local environment, and its instability easily leads to catalyst stripping from the substrate. By establishing detachment critical point and operating parameter&#8208;detachment correlation, a targeted reconstruction strategy is proposed to achieve smooth ligand leaching and effectively solve the detachment issue. Theoretical analyses validate the dual&#8208;site regulation in directionally reconstructed catalysts with optimized intermediate adsorption. Under industrial conditions, the coupled electrolyzer delivers an industrial&#8208;level current density at low cell voltage with prolonged durability, 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V for over 340 h. This work bridges the gap of leaching&#8208;type precatalysts between laboratory test conditions and industrial operating conditions.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Enabled Pneumatic Multiscale Shape Morphing for Adaptive, Programmable and Multimodal Radar&#8208;infrared Compatible Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the concept of pneumatic multiscale shape morphing and reverse engineering, the MXene&#8208;enabled pneumatic matrix demonstrates unprecedented radar&#8208;infrared compatible camouflage, including dynamic adaptability, multispectral compatibility, multi&#8208;pixel programmability, multi&#8208;modal switching, high responsiveness, performance robustness, and weak angular dependence. The approach establishes an upgradable solution and realistic platform for smart electromagnetic sheath and advanced electromagnetic functional materials.








Abstract
Achieving radar&#8208;infrared compatible camouflage with dynamic adaptability has been a long&#8208;sought goal, but faces significant challenges owing to the limited dispersion relations of conventional material systems operating in different wavelength ranges.

&lt;p&gt;Through the concept of pneumatic multiscale shape morphing and reverse engineering, the MXene-enabled pneumatic matrix demonstrates unprecedented radar-infrared compatible camouflage, including dynamic adaptability, multispectral compatibility, multi-pixel programmability, multi-modal switching, high responsiveness, performance robustness, and weak angular dependence. The approach establishes an upgradable solution and realistic platform for smart electromagnetic sheath and advanced electromagnetic functional materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving radar-infrared compatible camouflage with dynamic adaptability has been a long-sought goal, but faces significant challenges owing to the limited dispersion relations of conventional material systems operating in different wavelength ranges. Here, this work proposes the concept of pneumatic multiscale shape morphing and design a periodically arranged pneumatic unit consisting of MXene-based morphable conductors and intake platforms. During gas actuation, the morphable conductor transforms centimeter-scale 2D flat sheets into 3D balloon shapes to enhance microwave absorption behavior, and also reconfigures micrometer-scale MXene wrinkles into smooth planes in combination with cavity-induced low heat transfer to minimize infrared (IR) signatures. Through theory-guided reverse engineering, the final pneumatic matrix shows remarkable frequency tunability (2.64&#8211;18.0 GHz), moderate IR emissivity regulation (0.14 at 7&#8211;16.5 &#181;m), rapid responsiveness (&#8776;30 ms), wide-angle operation (&amp;gt;45&lt;sup&gt;&#176;&lt;/sup&gt;), and excellent environmental tolerance. Additionally, the multiplexed pneumatic matrix enables over 14 programmable coding sequences that independently alter thermal radiation without compromising radar stealth, and allows multimodal camouflage switching between three distinct compatible states. The approach may facilitate the evolution of camouflage techniques and electromagnetic functional materials toward multispectral, adaptability and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable, High&#8208;resolution Printing of Spatially Graded Perovskites for Multispectral Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step in situ mixing and printing of micro/nanostructured perovskites with arbitrary spatial gradients with ultrahigh resolution (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) is introduced for the first time, and high&#8208;performance multispectral photodetectors (Responsivity:&#160;69.88 A W&#8722;1, Detectivity: 3.27 &#215; 1015 Jones) are constructed, opening new avenues for the fabrication of miniaturized perovskite spectrometer and hyperspectral imaging sensors.








Abstract
Micro/nanostructured perovskites with spatially graded compositions and bandgaps are promising in filter&#8208;free, chip&#8208;level multispectral, and hyperspectral detection. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution patterning of perovskites with controlled graded compositions is challenging. Here, a programmable mixed electrohydrodynamic printing (M&#8208;ePrinting) technique is presented to realize the one&#8208;step direct&#8208;printing of arbitrary spatially graded perovskite micro/nanopatterns for the first time. M&#8208;ePrinting enables in situ mixing and ejection of solutions with controlled composition/bandgap by programmatically varying driving voltage applied to a multichannel nozzle. Composition can be graded over a single dot, line or complex pattern, and the printed feature size is down to 1&#160;&#181;m, which is the highest printing resolution of graded patterns to the knowledge. Photodetectors based on micro/nanostructured perovskites with halide ions gradually varying from Br to I are constructed, which successfully achieve multispectral detection and full&#8208;color imaging, with a high detectivity and responsivity of 3.27 &#215; 1015 Jones and 69.88 A W&#8722;1, respectively. The presented method provides a versatile and competitive approach for such miniaturized bandgap&#8208;tunable perovskite spectrometer platforms and artificial vision systems, and also opens new avenues for the digital fabrication of composition&#8208;programmable structures.

         <title>Biphase Pd Nanosheets with Atomic&#8208;Hybrid RhOx/Pd Amorphous Skins Disentangle the Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphase Pd@PdRh nanosheets within the form of ultrathin 2D crystalline Pd{111} inner cores wrapped by &#8776;1 nm thin atomic&#8208;hybrid RhOx/Pd amorphous skins are innovatively designed and synthesized. The surface flexible atomic&#8208;coordination and enriched RhOx/Pd atomic&#8208;interfaces cooperatively endow the products with unprecedented electrocatalysis performance for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
The activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off relationship of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a tricky issue that strikes the electrocatalyst population and hinders the widespread application of fuel cells. Here neoteric biphase Pd nanosheets that are structured with ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional crystalline Pd inner cores and &#8776;1 nm thin atomic&#8208;hybrid RhOx/Pd amorphous skins, named c/a&#8208;Pd@PdRh NSs, for disentangling this trade&#8208;off dilemma for alkaline ORR are developed. The superthin amorphous skins significantly amplify the quantity of flexibly low&#8208;coordinated atoms for electrocatalysis. An in situ selected oxidation of the top&#8208;surface Rh dopants creates atomically hybrid RhOx/Pd disorder surfaces. Detailed energy spectra and theoretical simulation confirm that these RhOx/Pd interfaces can arouse a surface charge redistribution, causing significant electron deficiency and lowered d&#8208;band center for surface Pd. Meanwhile, anticorrosive Rh/RhOx species can thermodynamically passivate the neighboring Pd atoms from oxidative dissolution. Thanks to these amplified interfacial effects, the biphase c/a&#8208;Pd@PdRh NSs simultaneously exhibit a superhigh ORR activity (5.92 A mg&#8722;1, 22.8 times that of Pt/C) and an outstanding long&#8208;lasting stability after 100k cycles of accelerated durability test, showcasing unprecedented electrocatalysts for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off relationship of ORR. This work paves a bran&#8208;new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts through creating modulated amorphous skins on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.

         <title>Orbital Electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;Dielectric for Droplet Manipulation on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a newly observed droplet manipulation phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces with orbital electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric (OEW), which is distinctive from the cross&#8208;electrode droplet manipulation in conventional electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric. Specially, the OEW enables precise, high&#8208;speed, residue&#8208;free, and durable droplet manipulation without electrode arrays and sophisticated circuit control, which are favorable for upgrading electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric&#8208;based chemical and biological technologies.








Abstract
Electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric (EWOD), recognized as the most successful electrical droplet actuation method, is essential in diverse applications, ranging from thermal management to microfluidics and water harvesting. Despite significant advances, it remains challenging to achieve repeatability, high speed, and simple circuitry in EWOD&#8208;based droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces. Moreover, its efficient operation typically requires electrode arrays and sophisticated circuit control. Here, a newly observed droplet manipulation phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces with orbital EWOD (OEW) is reported. Due to the asymmetric electrowetting force generated on the orbit, flexible and versatile droplet manipulation is facilitated with OEW. It is demonstrated that OEW droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces exhibits higher speed (up to 5 times faster), enhanced functionality (antigravity), and manipulation of diverse liquids (acid, base, salt, organic, e.g., methyl blue, artificial blood) without contamination, and good durability after 1000 tests. It is envisioned that this robust droplet manipulation strategy using OEW will provide a valuable platform for various processes involving droplets, spanning from microfluidic devices to controllable chemical reactions. The previously unreported droplet manipulation phenomenon and control strategy shown here can potentially upgrade EWOD&#8208;based microfluidics, antifogging, anti&#8208;icing, dust removal, and beyond.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Polyelectrolyte Complex Assembly of microRNA&#8208;Peptide Nanoparticles toward Treating Mesothelioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide design married with flash nanocomplexation affords highly stable and uniform polyelectrolyte complex microRNA&#8208;peptide nanoparticles (NPs). NP incorporation into a self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;based surface&#8208;fill hydrogel allows local delivery to tumor and subsequent inhibition of genes responsible for the progression of mesothelioma cancer in mice.








Abstract
Broad size distributions and poor long&#8208;term colloidal stability of microRNA&#8208;carrying nanoparticles, especially those formed by polyelectrolyte complexation, represent major hurdles in realizing their clinical translation. Herein, peptide design is used alongside optimized flash nanocomplexation (FNC) to produce uniform peptide&#8208;based miRNA particles of exceptional stability that display anticancer activity against mesothelioma in vitro and in vivo. Modulating the content and display of lysine&#8208;based charge from small intrinsically disordered peptides used to complex miRNA proves essential in achieving stable colloids. FNC facilitates kinetic isolation of the mechanistic steps involved in particle formation to allow the preparation of particles of discrete size in a highly reproducible, scalable, and continuous manner, facilitating pre&#8208;clinical studies.

&lt;p&gt;Peptide design married with flash nanocomplexation affords highly stable and uniform polyelectrolyte complex microRNA-peptide nanoparticles (NPs). NP incorporation into a self-assembled peptide-based surface-fill hydrogel allows local delivery to tumor and subsequent inhibition of genes responsible for the progression of mesothelioma cancer in mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad size distributions and poor long-term colloidal stability of microRNA-carrying nanoparticles, especially those formed by polyelectrolyte complexation, represent major hurdles in realizing their clinical translation. Herein, peptide design is used alongside optimized flash nanocomplexation (FNC) to produce uniform peptide-based miRNA particles of exceptional stability that display anticancer activity against mesothelioma in vitro and in vivo. Modulating the content and display of lysine-based charge from small intrinsically disordered peptides used to complex miRNA proves essential in achieving stable colloids. FNC facilitates kinetic isolation of the mechanistic steps involved in particle formation to allow the preparation of particles of discrete size in a highly reproducible, scalable, and continuous manner, facilitating pre-clinical studies. To the best of the authors knowledge, this work represents the first example of employing FNC to prepare polyelectrolyte complexes of miRNA and peptide. Encapsulation of these particles into an injectable hydrogel matrix allows for their localized in vivo delivery by syringe. A one-time injection of a gel containing particles composed of miRNA-215-5p and the peptide PKM1 limits tumor progression in a xenograft model of mesothelioma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supergravity&#8208;Steered Generic Manufacturing of Nanosheets&#8208;Embedded Nanocomposite Hydrogel with Highly Oriented, Heterogeneous Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supergravity&#8208;steered approach is designed to manipulate the assembly of arbitrary nanosheets from MXene to MoS2, GO, and C3N4 for fabricating oriented nanocomposite hydrogels with heterogeneous architecture. The resultant MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels showcase an extraordinary electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 55.2&#160;dB yet using a super&#8208;low MXene of 0.3 wt%, surpassing most hydrogels&#8208;based electromagnetic shielding materials.








Abstract
Designing nanocomposite hydrogels with oriented nanosheets has emerged as a promising toolkit to achieve preferential performances that go beyond their disordered counterparts. Although current fabrication strategies via electric/magnetic force fields have made remarkable achievements, they necessitate special properties of nanosheets and suffer from an inferior orientation degree of nanosheets. Herein, a facile and universal approach is discovered to elaborate MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels with highly oriented, heterogeneous architecture by virtue of supergravity to replace conventional force fields. The key to such architecture is to leverage bidirectional, force&#8208;tunable attributes of supergravity containing coupled orthogonal shear and centrifugal force field for steering high&#8208;efficient movement, pre&#8208;orientation, and stacking of MXene nanosheets in the bottom. Such a synergetic effect allows for yielding heterogeneous nanocomposite hydrogels with a high&#8208;orientation MXene&#8208;rich layer (orientation degree, f = 0.83) and a polymer&#8208;rich layer. The authors demonstrate that MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels leverage their high&#8208;orientation, heterogeneous architecture to deliver an extraordinary electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 55.2&#160;dB at 12.4&#160;GHz yet using a super&#8208;low MXene of 0.3 wt%, surpassing most hydrogels&#8208;based electromagnetic shielding materials. This versatile supergravity&#8208;steered strategy can be further extended to arbitrary nanosheets including MoS2, GO, and C3N4, offering a paradigm in the development of oriented nanocomposites.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Coordinated Tin Halide Perovskites for Wearable Health Monitoring and Weak Light Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Cyanoethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium iodide (CNI) is introduced to inhibit Sn2+ oxidation via strong coordination interaction. Self&#8208;powered photodetectors based on the CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite film with CNI exhibit low dark current, high detectivity, fast response speed, and good stability. Consequently, wearable health monitoring and weak light imaging with zero power consumption are successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Low&#8208;toxicity tin halide perovskites with excellent optoelectronic properties are promising candidates for photodetection. However, tin halide perovskite photodetectors have suffered from high dark current owing to uncontrollable Sn2+ oxidation. Here, 2&#8208;cyanoethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium iodide (CNI) is introduced in CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films to inhibit Sn2+ oxidation by the strong coordination interaction between the cyano group (C&#8801;N) and Sn2+. Consequently, FASnI3&#8208;CNI films exhibit reduced nonradiative recombination and lower trap density. The self&#8208;powered photodetector based on FASnI3&#8208;CNI exhibits low dark current (1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high detectivity (2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 785&#160;nm), fast response speed (2.62 &#181;s), and good stability. Mechanism studies show the increase in the activation energy required for thermal emission and generated&#160;carriers, leading to a lower dark current in the FASnI3&#8208;CNI photodetector. In addition, flexible photodetectors based on FASnI3&#8208;CNI, exhibiting high detectivity and fast response speed, are employed in wearable electronics to monitor the human heart rate under weak light and zero bias conditions. Finally, the FASnI3&#8208;CNI perovskite photodetectors are integrated with a 32&#160;&#215;&#160;32 thin&#8208;film transistor backplane, capable of ultraweak light (170 nW cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging with high contrast, and zero power consumption, demonstrating the great potential for image sensor applications.

         <title>Juice Vesicles Bioreactors Technology for Constructing Advanced Carbon&#8208;Based Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, for the first time, juice vesicles bioreactors (JVBs) biotechnology is reported to produce hierarchically structured carbon composites on a large scale. The synthetic mechanism of carbon composites via JVBs is explained. The well&#8208;designed 3D carbonaceous architecture combined with NiCo nanoparticles endows pomelo vesicles crosslinked carbon/NiCo&#8208;S electrode with superior high&#8208;rate performance and good cycling stability.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;quality carbon&#8208;based energy materials through biotechnology has always been an eager goal of the scientific community. Herein, juice vesicles bioreactors (JVBs) bio&#8208;technology based on hesperidium (e.g., pomelo, waxberry, oranges) is first reported for preparation of carbon&#8208;based composites with controllable components, adjustable morphologies, and sizes. JVBs serve as miniature reaction vessels that enable sophisticated confined chemical reactions to take place, ultimately resulting in the formations of complex carbon composites. The newly developed approach is highly versatile and can be compatible with a wide range of materials including metals, alloys, and metal compounds. The growth and self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of carbon composites via JVBs are explained. For illustration, NiCo alloy nanoparticles are successfully in situ implanted into pomelo vesicles crosslinked carbon (PCC) by JVBs, and their applications as sulfur/carbon cathodes for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are explored. The well&#8208;designed PCC/NiCo&#8208;S electrode exhibits superior high&#8208;rate properties and enhanced long&#8208;term stability. Synergistic reinforcement mechanisms on transportation of ions/electrons of interface reactions and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides arising from metal alloy and carbon architecture are proposed with the aid of DFT calculations. The research provides a novel biosynthetic route to rational design and fabrication of carbon composites for advanced energy storage.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Deep Eutectic Liquids Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Polarization Aluminum Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC&#8208;DELE) is constructed by diluting [AlCl3]1.3[Urea]1 with 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn). dFBn leads to better fluidity and ionic transport, without affecting the ionic dynamics. Al&#8208;graphite and Al&#8208;S batteries employing LC&#8208;DELEs exhibit weakened polarization and enhanced cyclic stability. This work demonstrates that LC&#8208;DELEs is a feasible strategy enabling low&#8208;polarization aluminum metal batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and nontoxic deep eutectic liquid electrolytes (DELEs), such as [AlCl3]1.3[Urea] (AU), are promising for rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous aluminum metal batteries (AMBs). However, their high viscosity and sluggish ion transport at room temperature lead to high cell polarization and low specific capacity, limiting their practical application. Herein, non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent of DELEs using AU as model to construct a locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC&#8208;DELE). dFBn effectively improves the fluidity and ion transport without affecting the ionic dynamics in the electrolyte. Moreover, dFBn also modifies the solid electrolyte interphase growing on the aluminum metal anodes and reduces the interfacial resistance. As a result, the lifespan of Al/Al cells is improved from 210 to 2000&#160;h, and the cell polarization is reduced from 0.36 to 0.14&#160;V at 1.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The rate performance of Al&#8208;graphite cells is greatly improved with a polarization reduction of 0.15 and 0.74&#160;V at 0.1 and 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, respectively. The initial discharge capacity of Al&#8208;sulfur cells is improved from 94 to 1640&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides a feasible solution to the high polarization of AMBs employing DELEs and a new path to high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost AMBs.

&lt;p&gt;A locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC-DELE) is constructed by diluting [AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;1.3&lt;/sub&gt;[Urea]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with 1,2-difluorobenzene (dFBn). dFBn leads to better fluidity and ionic transport, without affecting the ionic dynamics. Al-graphite and Al-S batteries employing LC-DELEs exhibit weakened polarization and enhanced cyclic stability. This work demonstrates that LC-DELEs is a feasible strategy enabling low-polarization aluminum metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-cost and nontoxic deep eutectic liquid electrolytes (DELEs), such as [AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;1.3&lt;/sub&gt;[Urea] (AU), are promising for rechargeable non-aqueous aluminum metal batteries (AMBs). However, their high viscosity and sluggish ion transport at room temperature lead to high cell polarization and low specific capacity, limiting their practical application. Herein, non-solvating 1,2-difluorobenzene (dFBn) is proposed as a co-solvent of DELEs using AU as model to construct a locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC-DELE). dFBn effectively improves the fluidity and ion transport without affecting the ionic dynamics in the electrolyte.

         <title>Ultrastable N&#8208;Type Semiconducting Fiber Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meticulously designed wet&#8208;spinning method successfully produces n&#8208;type semiconducting fibers with reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and ordered molecular arrangement. Organic electrochemical transistors based on these fibers exhibit superior performance and unprecedented stability, advancing the development of highly sensitive biosensors and fiber&#8208;based complementary logic circuits, and paving the way for fiber&#8208;based bioelectronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted increasing attention due to their merits of high transconductance, low operating voltage, and good biocompatibility, ideal for biosensors. However, further advances in their practical applications face challenges of low n&#8208;type performance and poor stability. Here, it is demonstrated that wet&#8208;spinning the commercially available n&#8208;type conjugated polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) into highly aligned and crystalline fibers enhances both OECT performance and stability. Although BBL is only soluble in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point strong acids, it can be wet&#8208;spun into high&#8208;quality fibers with adjustable diameters. The BBL fiber OECTs exhibit a record&#8208;high area&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,A) of 2.40 &#181;S &#181;m&#8722;2 and over 10 times higher figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) than its thin&#8208;film counterparts. More importantly, these fiber OECTs exhibit remarkable stability with no noticeable performance attenuation after 1500 cycles over 4&#160;h operation, outperforming all previously reported n&#8208;type OECTs. The superior performance and stability can be attributed to shorter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and ordered molecular arrangement in the fibers, endowing the BBL fiber OECT&#8208;based biosensors with outstanding sensitivity while keeping a miniaturized form factor. This work demonstrates that, beyond new material development, developing new fabrication technology is also crucial for addressing the performance and stability issues in n&#8208;type OECTs.

         <title>Phase Engineered CuxS&#8211;Ag2S with Photothermoelectric Activity for Enhanced Multienzyme Activity and Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous&#8208;crystalline hybrid material CuxS&#8211;Ag2S is explored for optimizing synergistic therapy. The characteristics of both amorphous and crystalline phases play a key role in thermoelectrodynamically enhancing enzyme catalytic activity. Thus, the catalytic active site is increased, site competition is avoided, and the temperature gradient is reasonably constructed.








Abstract
The insufficient exposure sites and active site competition of multienzyme are the two main factors to hinder its therapeutic effect. Here, a phase&#8208;junction nanomaterial (amorphous&#8208;crystalline CuxS&#8211;Ag2S) is designed and prepared through a simple room temperature ion&#8208;exchange process. A small amount of Ag+ is added into Cu7S4 nanocrystals, which transforms Cu7S4 into amorphous phased CuxS and produces crystalline Ag2S simultaneously. In this structure, the overhanging bonds on the amorphous CuxS surface provide abundant active sites for optimizing the therapeutic activity. Meanwhile, the amorphous state enhances the photothermal effect through non&#8208;radiative relaxation, and due to its low thermal resistance, phase&#8208;junction CuxS&#8211;Ag2S forms a significant temperature gradient to unlock the optimized thermo&#8208;electrodynamic therapy. Furthermore, benefiting from the high asymmetry of the amorphous state, the material forms a spin&#8208;polarized state that can effectively inhibit electron&#8211;hole recombination. In this way, the thermoelectric effect can facilitate the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed cycle by providing electrons and holes, enabling an enhanced coupling of thermoelectric therapy with multienzyme activity, which induces excellent anti&#8208;tumor performance. More importantly, the catalytic process simulated by density&#8208;functional theory proves that Ag+ alleviates the burden on the Cu sites through favorable adsorption of O2 and prevents active site competition.

         <title>Enhancing Light Outcoupling Efficiency via Anisotropic Low Refractive Index Electron Transporting Materials for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

An anisotropic anthracene derivative, 9,10&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl) anthracene, featuring a low extraordinary refractive index and high electron mobility, is developed as an efficient electron transporting material for perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) to enhance light outcoupling efficiency and carrier balance of the devices, which promotes green PeLEDs with a record EQE of 32.1%.








Abstract
Thanks to the extensive efforts toward optimizing perovskite crystallization properties, high&#8208;quality perovskite films with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield are successfully achieved. However, the light outcoupling efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is impeded by insufficient light extraction, which poses a challenge to the further advancement of PeLEDs. Here, an anisotropic multifunctional electron transporting material, 9,10&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl) anthracene (BPBiPA), with a low extraordinary refractive index (ne) and high electron mobility is developed for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs. The anisotropic molecular orientations of BPBiPA can result in a low ne of 1.59 along the z&#8208;axis direction. Optical simulations show that the low ne of BPBiPA can effectively mitigate the surface plasmon polariton loss and enhance the photon extraction efficiency in waveguide mode, thereby improving the light outcoupling efficiency of PeLEDs. In addition, the high electron mobility of BPBiPA can facilitate balanced carrier injection in PeLEDs. As a result, high&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 32.1% and a current efficiency of 111.7&#160;cd A&#8722;1 are obtained, which provides new inspirations for the design of electron transporting materials for high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Modular Protein Fibers with Outstanding High&#8208;Strength and Acid&#8208;Resistance Performance Mediated by Copper Ion Binding and Imine Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust protein fibers are constructed from chimeric proteins consisting of rigid amyloid peptide and flexible elastin&#8208;like protein modules. The Cu2+ binding and imine crosslinking are introduced to construct the double networks, which endow the fibers with exceptional mechanical performance and acid resistance. Gastric perforation suturing is successfully investigated, greatly expanding their multi&#8208;scenario applications in complex environments.








Abstract
Engineered protein fibers are promising biomaterials with diverse applications due to their tunable protein structure and outstanding mechanical properties. However, it remains challenging at the molecular level to achieve satisfied mechanical properties and environmental tolerance simultaneously, especially under extreme acid conditions. Herein, the construction of artificial fibers comprising chimeric proteins made of rigid amyloid peptide and flexible cationic elastin&#8208;like protein (ELP) module is reported. The amyloid peptide readily assembles into highly organized &#946;&#8208;sheet structures that can be further strengthened by the coordination of Cu2+, while the flexible ELP module allows the formation of imine&#8208;based crosslinking networks. These double networks synergistically enhance the mechanical properties of the fibers, leading to a high tensile strength and toughness, overwhelming many reported recombinant spidroin fibers. Notably, the coordination of Cu2+ with serine residues could stabilize &#946;&#8208;sheet structures in the fibers under acidic conditions, which makes the fibers robust against acid, thus enabling their successful utilization in gastric perforation suturing. This work highlights the customization of double networks at the molecular level to create tailored high&#8208;performance protein fibers for various application scenarios.

         <title>Electropolymerized Bipolar Poly(2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine) Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Al&#8208;Ion Batteries with An Extended Temperature Range of &#8722;20 to 45&#160;&#176;C</title>

The high charge density and strong electrostatic interactions of Al3+ present a significant challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a bipolar polymer with a long&#8208;range conjugated skeleton, high electronic/ionic conductivity, and a three&#8208;electron reaction mechanism is designed that enables high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance, even within a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;45 &#176;C).








Abstract
Achieving reversible insertion/extraction in most cathodes for aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) is a significant challenge due to the high charge density of Al3+ and strong electrostatic interactions. Organic materials facilitate the hosting of multivalent carriers and rapid ions diffusion through the rearrangement of chemical bonds. Here, a bipolar conjugated poly(2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine) (PDAP) on carbon substrates prepared via a straightforward electropolymerization method is introduced as cathode for AAIBs. The integration of n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type active units endow PDAP with an increased number of sites for ions interaction. The long&#8208;range conjugated skeleton enhances electron delocalization and collaborates with carbon to ensure high conductivity. Moreover, the strong intermolecular interactions including &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding significantly enhance its stability. Consequently, the Al//PDAP battery exhibits a large capacity of 338 mAh g&#8722;1 with long lifespan and high&#8208;rate capability. It consistently demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performances even under extreme conditions with capacities of 155 and 348 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20 and 45&#160;&#176;C, respectively. In/ex situ spectroscopy comprehensively elucidates its cation/anion (Al3+/H3O+ and ClO4&#8722;) storage with 3&#8208;electron transfer in dual electroactive centers (C&#9552;N and &#8211;NH&#8211;). This study presents a promising strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic cathode for AAIBs over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Ice&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Atomic Cluster Cocatalyst with Regulable Coordination Number for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile ice&#8208;templating method is developed to synthesize photocatalyst cocatalysts with controllable coordination numbers, and morphologies ranging from single atoms to atomic clusters and nanoparticles. The approach is effective for various metals and photocatalysts. Ru atomic clusters with controlled coordination number loaded on Ga&#8208;doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1O7S5 enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution. This atomically controllable cocatalyst strategy is significant for boosting photocatalysis.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have been exploited in various applications. Among them, cocatalyst supported on photocatalyst is essential for activation of photocatalysis. However, cocatalyst decoration in a controllable fashion to promote intrinsic activity remains challenging. Herein, a versatile method is developed for cocatalyst synthesis using an ice&#8208;templating (ICT) strategy, resulting in size control from single&#8208;atom (SA), and atomic clusters (AC) to nanoparticles (NP). Importantly, the coordination numbers (CN) of decorated AC cocatalysts are highly controllable, and this ICT method applies to various metals and photocatalytic substrates. Taking narrow&#8208;band gap Ga&#8208;doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1O7S5 (LTCA) photocatalyst as an example, supported Ru AC/LTCA catalysts with regulable Ru CNs have been prepared, delivering significantly enhanced activities compared to Ru SA and Ru NPs supported on LTCA. Specifically, Ru(CN = 3.4) AC/LTCA with an average CN of Ru&#9472;Ru bond measured to be &#8776;3.4 exhibits excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (578&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1) under visible light irradiation. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the modeled Ru(CN = 3) atomic cluster cocatalyst possesses favorable electronic properties and available active sites for the H2 evolution reaction.

         <title>Weak Electrostatic Force on K+ in Gel Polymer Electrolyte Realizes High Ion Transference Number for Quasi Solid&#8208;State Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak electrostatic force between K+ and electronegative functional groups is revealed. Thus, a unique K&#8208;ion conducting in situ multilayered gel polymer electrolyte (K&#8208;ISMGPE), which can enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics and inhibit the dendrite growth, is designed. These properties endow it with high ionic conductivity and ion transference number at room temperature. Potassium&#8208;ion batteries using K&#8208;ISMGPE possess superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SSPIBs) are of great potential for commercial use due to the abundant reserves and cost&#8208;effectiveness of resources, as well as high safety. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high ionic conductivity and fast interfacial charge transport are necessary for SSPIBs. Here, the weak electrostatic force between K+ and electronegative functional groups in the ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer chains, which can promote fast migration of free K+, is revealed. To further enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics, a multilayered GPE by in situ growth of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) on ETPTA (PVDF&#8208;HFP|ETPTA|PVDF&#8208;HFP) is constructed to improve the interface contact and provide sufficient K+ concentration in PVDF&#8208;HFP. A high ion transference number (0.92) and a superior ionic conductivity (5.15 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) are achieved. Consequently, the SSPIBs with both intercalation&#8208;type (PB) and conversion&#8208;type (PTCDA) cathodes show the best battery performance among all reported SSPIBs of the same cathode. These findings demonstrate that potassium&#8208;ion batteries have the potential to surpass Li/Na ion batteries in solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Tuning Surface Potential Polarization to Enhance N2 Affinity for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction is a sustainable method for ammonia synthesis, but the adsorption and activation process of N2 limits its reaction efficiency. This work demonstrates that tuning the surface potential polarization of Bi2WO6 can greatly enhance the adsorption and activation ability of N2 molecules, and improve the conversion efficiency under acidic reaction conditions.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) to synthesize ammonia is a sustainable reaction that is expected to replace Haber Bosch process. Laminated Bi2WO6 has great potential as an NRR electrocatalyst, however, the effective activity requires that the inert substrate is fully activated. Here, for the first time, success is achieved in activating the Bi2WO6 basal planes with NRR activity through Ti doping. The introduction of Ti successfully tunes the surface potential distribution and enhances the N2 adsorption. The subsequently strong hybrid coupling of d(Ti)&#8208;p(N) orbitals fills the electronic state of N2 antibonding molecular orbital, which greatly weakens the bonding strength of N&#8801;N bonds. Further, in situ synchrotron radiation&#8208;based Fourier transform infrared&#160;(SR&#8208;FTIR) spectrum and theoretical calculations show that surface potential polarization enhances the adsorption of HNN* by Bi&#8208;Ti dual&#8208;metal sites, which is beneficial for the subsequent activation hydrogenation process. The Ti&#8208;Bi2WO6 nanosheets achieve 11.44% Faradaic efficiency (&#8722;0.2&#160;V vs. RHE), a NH3 yield rate of 23.14&#160;&#181;g&#160;mg&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (15N calibration), and satisfactory stability in 0.1&#160;M HCl environment. The mutual assistance of theory and experiment can help understand and develop of excellent two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials for the NRR.

         <title>Synergizing Pyroelectric Catalysis and Enzyme Catalysis: Establishing a Reciprocal and Synergistic Model to Enhance Anti&#8208;Tumor Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>

ZnSnO3@MXene composites can effectively improve the enzymatic activity of MXene by fully utilizing the pyroelectric effect of ZnSnO3. Meanwhile, MXene provides an inducement for the pyroelectric effect of ZnSnO3 ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles (USNPs). Combined with highly cell membrane permeability enhanced by polarized charge, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.








Abstract
Nanozyme activity is greatly weakened by the microenvironment and multidrug resistance of tumor cells. Hence, a bi&#8208;catalytic nanoplatform, which promotes the anti&#8208;tumor activity through &#8220;charging empowerment&#8221; and &#8220;mutual complementation&#8221; processes involved in enzymatic and pyroelectric catalysis, by loading ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles (USNPs) of pyroelectric ZnSnO3 onto MXene nanozyme (V2CTx nanosheets), is developed. Here, the V2CTx nanosheets exhibit enhanced peroxidase activity by reacting V3+ with H2O2 to generate toxic &#183;OH, accelerated by the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated heat effect. The resulting V4+ is then converted to V3+ by oxidizing endogenous glutathione (GSH), realizing an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed cycle. However, the cycle will lose its persistence once GSH is insufficient; nevertheless, the pyroelectric charges generated by ZnSnO3 USNPs continuously support the V4+/V3+ conversion and ensure nanoenzyme durability. Moreover, the hyperthermia arising from the V2CTx nanosheets by NIR irradiation results in an ideal local temperature gradient for the ZnSnO3 USNPs, giving rise to an excellent pyroelectric catalytic effect by promoting band bending. Furthermore, polarized charges increase the tumor cell membrane permeability and facilitate nanodrug accumulation, thereby resolving the multidrug resistance issue. Thus, the combination of pyroelectric and enzyme catalysis together with the photothermal effect solves the dilemma of nanozymes and improves the antitumor efficiency.

         <title>Space&#8208;Efficient 3D Microalgae Farming with Optimized Resource Utilization for Regenerative Food</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of 3D bioprinting and vertical agriculture offers promising opportunities for cultivating microalgae as regenerative food resource. Biogenic systems that incorporate microalgae in rational design of hydrogels significantly boost microalgae yield for each unit of water consumed. This strategy addresses critical challenges including self&#8208;shading effects and inefficient space utilization, paving the way for more accessible and sustainable food production.








Abstract
Photosynthetic microalgae produce valuable metabolites and are a source of sustainable food that supports life without compromising arable land. However, the light self&#8208;shading, excessive water supply, and insufficient space utilization in microalgae farming have limited its potential in the inland areas most in need of regenerative food solutions. Herein, this work develops a 3D polysaccharide&#8208;based hydrogel scaffold for vertically farming microalgae without needing liquid media. This liquid&#8208;free strategy is compatible with diverse microalgal species and enables the design of living microalgal frameworks with customizable architectures that enhance light and water utilization. This approach significantly increases microalgae yield per unit water consumption, with an 8.8&#8208;fold increase compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the dehydrated hydrogels demonstrate a reduced size and weight (&#8776;70% reduction), but readily recover their vitality upon rehydration. Importantly, valuable natural products can be produced in this system including proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and carotenoids. This study streamlines microalgae regenerative farming for low&#8208;carbon biomanufacturing by minimizing light self&#8208;shading, relieving water supply, and reducing physical footprints, and democratizing access to efficient aquatic food production.

         <title>Achieving Bright and Long&#8208;Lived Aqueous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Carbon Nitrogen Dots Through In Situ Host&#8211;Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study successfully develops an efficient in situ host&#8211;guest approach for synthesizing water&#8208;boosted phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots through a one&#8208;pot pyrolysis of cyanuric acid. This material exhibits bright and long&#8208;lived aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, even in fully aqueous environments, thereby demonstrating significant potential for high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio afterglow bioimaging both in vitro and in vivo, as well as advanced information encryption applications.








Abstract
The development of bright and long&#8208;lived aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials holds paramount importance in broadening the application scope of RTP material system. However, the conventional RTP materials usually exhibit low efficiency and short lifetime in aqueous solution. Herein, an in situ host&#8211;guest strategy is proposed to achieve cyanuric acid (CA)&#8208;derived phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots (CNDs) composite (CNDs@CA) that demonstrates a significant enhancement of both quantum yield (QY) and lifetime mediated by water. Detailed investigations reveal that the robust hydrogen bonding networks between CNDs@CA and water effectively stabilize triplet excitons and suppress nonradiative decays, as well as facilitate efficient energy transfer from CA to CNDs, thereby prolonging the lifetime and enhancing the efficiency of RTP. The phosphorescent QY and lifetime of CNDs@CA can be increased to 26.89% (3.9&#8208;fold increase) and 951.25&#160;ms (5.5&#8208;fold increase), respectively, with the incorporation of 50 wt% water under ambient conditions. Even in fully aqueous environments (with up to 400 wt% water added), CNDs@CA exhibits persistent water&#8208;boosted RTP properties, demonstrating exceptional stability. The robust water&#8208;boosted RTP property of CNDs@CA in aqueous solutions presents significant potential for high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio afterglow bioimaging as well as advanced information encryption.

         <title>570 Wh&#160;kg&#8315;1&#8208;Grade Lithium Metal Pouch Cell with 4.9V Highly Li+ Conductive Armor&#8208;Like Cathode Electrolyte Interphase via Partially Fluorinated Electrolyte Engineering</title>

A highly Li+ conductive armor&#8208;like CEI formed in partially fluorinated electrolyte with 0.5&#160;wt% TMSB additive is designed for 570 Wh&#160;kg&#8315;1&#8208;grade Li||LRMO pouch cells. Such armor&#8208;like CEI composed of LiBxOy and LixPOyFz outer layer and LiF and Li3PO4 inner part can reduce lattice oxygen loss, improve mechanical strength, and promote the conductivity of Li+ for enhanced performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) are promisingly used in high&#8208;energy lithium metal pouch cells due to high specific capacity/working voltage. However, the interfacial stability of LRMOs remains challenging. To address this question, a novel armor&#8208;like cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) model is proposed for stabilizing LRMO&#160;cathode at 4.9&#160;V by exploring partially fluorinated electrolyte formulation. The fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and tris (trimethylsilyl) borate (TMSB) in formulated electrolyte largely contribute to the formation of 4.9&#160;V armor&#8208;like CEI with LiBxOy and LixPOyFz outer layer and LiF&#8208; and Li3PO4&#8208;rich inner part. Such CEI effectively inhibits lattice oxygen loss and facilitates the Li+ migration smoothly for guaranteeing LRMO cathode to deliver superior cycling and rate performance. As expected, Li||LRMO batteries with such electrolyte achieve capacity retention of 85.7% with high average Coulomb efficiency (CE) of 99.64% after 300 cycles at 4.8&#160;V/0.5 C, and even obtain capacity retention of 87.4% after 100 cycles at higher cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.9&#160;V. Meanwhile, the 9 Ah&#8208;class Li||LRMO pouch cells with formulated electrolyte show over thirty&#8208;eight stable cycling life with high energy density of 576&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 4.8&#160;V.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with Synthetic Sulfonamide&#8208;Based Solvent and Electrochemically Active Additives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are strategically designed by optimizing the electrolyte solvents and constructing stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Synthetic 1&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)piperidine effectively mitigates the drawbacks of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane and facilitates the construction of a well&#8208;designed multilayer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, enabling stable operation of high&#8208;voltage LMBs.








Abstract
Considering practical viability, Li&#8208;metal battery electrolytes should be formulated by tuning solvent composition similar to electrolyte systems for Li&#8208;ion batteries to enable the facile salt&#8208;dissociation, ion&#8208;conduction, and introduction of sacrificial additives for building stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Although 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane with a high&#8208;donor number enables the implementation of ionic compounds as effective interface modifiers, its ubiquitous usage is limited by its low&#8208;oxidation durability and high&#8208;volatility. Regulation of the solvation structure and construction of well&#8208;structured interfacial layers ensure the potential strength of electrolytes in both Li&#8208;metal and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811). This study reports the build&#8208;up of multilayer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase by utilizing different electron&#8208;accepting tendencies of lithium difluoro(bisoxalato) phosphate (LiDFBP), lithium nitrate, and synthetic 1&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)piperidine. Furthermore, a well&#8208;structured cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface from LiDFBP effectively addresses the issues with NCM811. The developed electrolyte based on a framework of highly&#8208; and weakly&#8208;solvating solvents with interface modifiers enables the operation of Li|NCM811 cells with a high areal capacity cathode (4.3 mAh cm&#8722;2) at 4.4&#160;V versus Li/Li+.

         <title>Building Stable Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new iodinated solid polymer electrolyte (ISPE) for SPMBs activates the potassium channels in the PEO chain; the functional ions in situ construct a stable interlayer. The ISPE exhibits high ionic conductivity, high K+ ion transference number, and high electrochemical stability voltage, exhibiting stable electrochemical performance. A novel strategy for electrolyte design for high&#8208;performance stable SPMB pouch cells is presented.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries (SPMBs) are promising candidates for the next generation of energy storage systems for their low cost, safety, and high energy density. However, full SPMBs are not yet reported due to the K dendrites, interfacial incompatibility, and limited availability of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Here, stable SPMBs using a new iodinated solid polymer electrolyte (ISPE) are presented. The functional ions reconstruct ion transport channels, providing efficient potassium ion transport. ISPE shows a combination of high ionic conductivity, superior interfacial compatibility, and electrochemical stability. In situ alloying and iodinated interlayer increase K metal compatibility for prolonged cycling with low polarization. Moreover, the ISPE enables SPMBs with Prussian blue cathode stable operation at a high voltage of 4.5&#160;V, a superior rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling over 3000 cycles (4.2&#160;V vs K+/K) with an ultra&#8208;high coulombic efficiency of 99.94%. More importantly, a classic solid&#8208;state potassium metal pouch cell achieves 4.2&#160;V stable cycling over 800 cycles with a high retention of 93.6%, presenting a new development strategy for secure and high&#8208;performance rechargeable solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular bridge is introduced at the flexible SnO2/perovskite interface to simultaneously achieve in situ bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation and interfacial passivation utilizing organic bifunctional passivator sodium 2&#8208;cyanoacetate (SZC). The flexible indoor perovskite solar cells deliver an exceptional 41.33% at 1000 lux with a high fill factor of 84.32%.








Abstract
A robust perovskite&#8208;buried interface is pivotal for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible indoor photovoltaics as it significantly influences charge transport and extraction efficiency. Herein, a molecular bridge strategy is introduced utilizing sodium 2&#8208;cyanoacetate (SZC) additive at the perovskite&#8208;buried interface to simultaneously achieve in situ passivation of interfacial defects and bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation, resulting in high&#8208;performance flexible indoor photovoltaic applications. Supported by both theoretical calculations and experimental evidences, it illustrates how SZCs serve as molecular bridges, establishing robust bonds between SnO2 transport layer and perovskite, mitigating oxygen vacancy defects and under&#8208;coordinated Pb defects at interface during flexible fabrication. This, in turn, enhances interfacial energy level alignment and facilitates efficient carrier transport. Moreover, this in situ investigation of perovskite crystallization dynamics reveals bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation, extending perovskite growth at the buried interface and influencing subsequent surface recrystallization. This results in larger crystalline grains and improved lattice strain of the perovskite during flexible fabrication. Finally, the optimized flexible solar cells achieve an impressive efficiency exceeding 41% at 1000 lux, with a fill factor as high as 84.32%. The concept of the molecular bridge represents a significant advancement in enhancing the performance of perovskite&#8208;based flexible indoor photovoltaics for the upcoming era of Internet of Things (IoT).

         <title>Programmed Targeting Pyruvate Metabolism Therapy Amplified Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme&#8208;Activated Pyroptosis for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric N, S&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom nanozyme pyroptosis initiator (Cu&#8208;NS@UK@POx) is developed to enhance cellular immunogenicity and reshape the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) for effective antitumor immunotherapy. Not only does it trigger pyroptosis through cascade biocatalysis to boost the immunogenicity of tumor cells but also remodels the immunosuppressive TME by a programmed targeting of pyruvate metabolism.








Abstract
Increasing cellular immunogenicity and reshaping the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial for antitumor immunotherapy. Herein, this work develops a novel single&#8208;atom nanozyme pyroptosis initiator: UK5099 and pyruvate oxidase (POx)&#8208;co&#8208;loaded Cu&#8208;NS single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu&#8208;NS@UK@POx), that not only trigger pyroptosis through cascade biocatalysis to boost the immunogenicity of tumor cells, but also remodel the immunosuppressive TME by targeting pyruvate metabolism. By replacing N with weakly electronegative S, the original spatial symmetry of the Cu&#8208;N4 electron distribution is changed and the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process is effectively regulated. Compared to spatially symmetric Cu&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Cu&#8208;N4 SA), the S&#8208;doped spatially asymmetric single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Cu&#8208;NS SA) exhibit stronger oxidase activities, including peroxidase (POD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOx), L&#8208;cysteine oxidase (LCO), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), which can cause enough reactive oxygen species (ROS) storms to trigger pyroptosis. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Cu&#8208;NS SA, UK5099, and POx can target pyruvate metabolism, which not only improves the immune TME but also increases the degree of pyroptosis. This study provides a two&#8208;pronged treatment strategy that can significantly activate antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, NADH/glutathione/L&#8208;cysteine consumption, pyruvate oxidation, and lactic acid (LA)/ATP depletion, triggering pyroptosis and regulating metabolism. This work provides a broad vision for expanding antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Microalgae&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Its Associated Anxiety and Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral microalgae&#8208;based hydrogel is developed to treat inflammatory bowel disease and its associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis. The hydrogel can reduce intestinal inflammation, maintain intestinal homeostasis, and inhibit neuroinflammation, then significantly alleviate the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors.








Abstract
Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit a notable prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, the etiology of psychiatric disorders associated with IBD remains uncertain, and an efficacious treatment approach has yet to be established. Herein, an oral hydrogel strategy (SP@Rh&#8208;gel) is proposed for co&#8208;delivery of Spirulina platensis and rhein to treat IBD and IBD&#8208;associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis. SP@Rh&#8208;gel improves the solubility, release characteristics and intestinal retention capacity of the drug, leading to a significant improvement in the oral therapeutic efficacy. Oral administration of SP@Rh&#8208;gel can reduce intestinal inflammation and rebalance the disrupted intestinal microbial community. Furthermore, SP@Rh&#8208;gel maintains intestinal barrier integrity and reduces the release of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and their entry into the hippocampus through the blood&#8208;brain barrier, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation and maintaining neuroplasticity. SP@Rh&#8208;gel significantly alleviates the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors, in a chronic colitis mouse model. This study demonstrates the significant involvement of the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis in the development of IBD with psychiatric disorders and proposes a safe, simple, and highly efficient therapeutic approach for managing IBD and comorbid psychiatric disorders.

         <title>Selective Extraction of Critical Metals from Spent Li&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode: Cation&#8211;Anion Coordination and Anti&#8208;Solvent Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the differences in binding energy after coordination between anions in DES and transition metals, as well as the differences in Gibbs free energy of different coordination structures in acetone, an efficient and cost&#8208;effective system is designed for the selective recovery of transition metal ions.








Abstract
Owing to continuing global use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), in particular in electric vehicles (EVs), there is a need for sustainable recycling of spent LIBs. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are reported as &#8220;green solvents&#8221; for low&#8208;cost and sustainable recycling. However, the lack of understanding of the coordination mechanisms between DESs and transition metals (Ni, Mn and Co) and Li makes selective separation of transition metals with similar physicochemical properties practically difficult. Here, it is found that the transition metals and Li have a different stable coordination structure with the different anions in DES during leaching. Further, based on the different solubility of these coordination structures in anti&#8208;solvent (acetone), a leaching and separation process system is designed, which enables high selective recovery of transition metals and Li from spent cathode LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111), with recovery of acetone. Recovery of spent LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode is also evidenced and a significant selective recovery for Co and Li is established, together with recovery and reuse of acetone and DES. It is concluded that the tuning of cation&#8211;anion coordination structure and anti&#8208;solvent crystallization are practical for selective recovery of critical metal resources in the spent LIBs recycling.

         <title>COF/In2S3 S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst with Enhanced Light Absorption and H2O2&#8208;Production Activity and fs&#8208;TA Investigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;scheme covalent organic framwork (COF)/In2S3 photocatalysts prepared in this work exhibit remarkable visible&#8208;light absorption and high&#8208;performance H2O2 synthesis from air and pure water. Experimental and theoretical results reveal the formation of hybrid energy levels that greatly extends the photoresponse range. The S&#8208;scheme carrier transfer mechanism and multipathways for H2O2 formation are identified. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction and extended light&#8208;harvesting range result in exceptional photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis from water and O2 is an economical, eco&#8208;friendly, and sustainable route for H2O2 production. However, single&#8208;component photocatalysts are subjected to limited light&#8208;harvesting range, fast carrier recombination, and weak redox power. To promote photogenerated carrier separation and enhance redox abilities, an organic/inorganic S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is fabricated by in situ growing In2S3 nanosheets on a covalent organic framwork (COF) substrate for efficient H2O2 production in pure water. Interestingly, compared to unitary COF and In2S3, the COF/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts exhibit significantly larger light&#8208;harvesting range and stronger visible&#8208;light absorption. Partial density of state calculation, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveal that the coordination between In2S3 and COF induces the formation of mid&#8208;gap hybrid energy levels, leading to smaller energy gaps and broadened absorption. Combining electron spin resonance spectroscopy, radical&#8208;trapping experiments, and isotope labeling experiments, three pathways for H2O2 formation are identified. Benefited from expanded light&#8208;absorption range, enhanced carrier separation, strong redox power, and multichannel H2O2 formation, the optimal composite shows an impressive H2O2&#8208;production rate of 5713.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. This work exemplifies an effective strategy to ameliorate COF&#8208;based photocatalysts by building S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into their impact on energy level modulation.

Dynamic Acoustic Beamshaping
Coupling&#8208;immune acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces are first proposed in acoustics to achieve remote moir&#233; effects decoupled from the interlayer distance. Twist&#8208;angle&#8208;controlled dynamic acoustic beam shaping will significantly enhance the practical applications of moir&#233; devices in remote dynamic detection and multiplexed underwater acoustic communication. More details can be found in article number 2313004 by Yan&#8208;Feng Wang, Yue&#8208;Sheng Wang, Cheng&#8208;Wei Qiu, and co&#8208;workers.

Light&#8208;Activated Gas Sensors
In article number 2313731, Il&#8208;Doo Kim and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that dual&#8208;photosensitizers exemplified by Bi dopants and Au nanoparticles tailor the electronic and chemical properties of In2O3 by creating mid&#8208;gap states and red&#8208;shifting optimal absorption wavelengths. Their synergistic interplay enables high&#8208;performance NO2 sensing under single&#8208;source and mixed&#8208;light conditions simulated for indoor lighting.

Space&#8208;Efficient Microalgae Farming
Photosynthetic microalgae are a sustainable food source without using arable land. However, challenges such as light self&#8208;shading, excessive water use, and insufficient space utilization hinder their farming as regenerative food solutions. In article number 2401172, Jiajing Zhou, Wei Lin, Joseph J Richardson, and co&#8208;workers develop a hydrogel scaffold for vertical microalgae farming, which enables the rational design of culture systems with improved light, water, and space utilization to reduce physical footprints of food production.

Topological Spin Textures
Implementation of magnets with low&#8208;damping, minimum Joule heating and tunable topological spin properties consist one of the main goals towards novel information storage technologies. In article number 2311949, Sergey Grebenchuk, Elton J. G. Santos, Maciej Koperski, and co&#8208;workers report that a wide variety of topological magnetic textures can be created and controlled on&#8208;demand on CrBr3 van der Waals magnet insulators at different thicknesses, temperatures and external excitations, such as energy&#8208;efficient optical excitations.

Self&#8208;Assembled Lipidated Peptide Nanomaterials
&#946;&#8208;Peptides have great potential as novel biomaterials and therapeutic agents due to their ability to self&#8208;assemble into low dimensional nanostructures resistant to degradation in vivo. Irene Yarovsky and co&#8208;workers develop a computational approach to model self&#8208;assembled &#946;&#8208;peptide nanostructures in all atom detail showing good agreement with X&#8208;ray fiber diffraction and AFM data. The synergistic approach will be useful for designing peptide nanomaterials for biomedical and engineering applications. More details can be found in article number 2311103.

Noncentrosymmetric Triangular Magnets
In article number 2313763, Xudong Huai, Thao Tran, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a framework for designing triangular magnets with atomically precise control of competing intralayer and interlayer magnetic exchange interactions. Careful considerations of isotope purity, nuclear and electronic spins, lattice symmetry, frontier orbitals and electronic states for CaMnTeO6 result in strong quantum fluctuations.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202313763"&gt;2313763&lt;/a&gt;, Xudong Huai, Thao Tran, and co-workers demonstrate a framework for designing triangular magnets with atomically precise control of competing intralayer and interlayer magnetic exchange interactions. Careful considerations of isotope purity, nuclear and electronic spins, lattice symmetry, frontier orbitals and electronic states for CaMnTeO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; result in strong quantum fluctuations.

         <title>Biocompatible 2D Materials via Liquid Phase Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials can be effectively produced by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) using different conditions. LPE generates 2D materials in aqueous solutions, represented by graphene, black phosphorus, transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, and possess a huge potential in the biomedical domain, spanning cancer therapy, drug delivery as well as antimicrobial and biosensing.








Abstract
2D materials (2DMs), such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and black phosphorus (BP), have been proposed for different types of bioapplications, owing to their unique physicochemical, electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), as one of the most effective up&#8208;scalable and size&#8208;controllable methods, is becoming the standard process to produce high quantities of various 2DM types as it can benefit from the use of green and biocompatible conditions. The resulting exfoliated layered materials have garnered significant attention because of their biocompatibility and their potential use in biomedicine as new multimodal therapeutics, antimicrobials, and biosensors. This review focuses on the production of LPE&#8208;assisted 2DMs in aqueous solutions with or without the aid of surfactants, bioactive, or non&#8208;natural molecules, providing insights into the possibilities of applications of such materials in the biological and biomedical fields.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks Toward Advanced Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the relationship between COF structures and their applications in different zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBBs), outlining the optimal mechanisms in improving electrochemical performance. Taking the structural diversity as a starting point, it is an opportune time to summarize the similarities among different COF&#8208;correlated materials to suppress electrode&#8208;related issues and delineate their distinctions in different&#160;ZBBs.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBBs) have demonstrated considerable potential among secondary batteries, attributing to their advantages including good safety, environmental friendliness, and high energy density. However, ZBBs still suffer from issues such as the formation of zinc dendrites, occurrence of side reactions, retardation of reaction kinetics, and shuttle effects, posing a great challenge for practical applications. As promising porous materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and their derivatives have rigid skeletons, ordered structures, and permanent porosity, which endow them with great potential for application in ZBBs. This review, therefore, provides a systematic overview detailing on COFs structure pertaining to electrochemical performance of ZBBs, following an in depth discussion of the challenges faced by ZBBs, which includes dendrites and side reactions at the anode, as well as dissolution, structural change, slow kinetics, and shuttle effect at the cathode. Then, the structural advantages of COF&#8208;correlated materials and their roles in various ZBBs are highlighted. Finally, the challenges of COF&#8208;correlated materials in ZBBs are outlined and an outlook on the future development of COF&#8208;correlated materials for ZBBs is provided. The review would serve as a valuable reference for further research into the utilization of COF&#8208;correlated materials in ZBBs.

         <title>General Design Concept of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects, electronic properties, support and interface effects, coordination environment of single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) and SASCs&#8208;derived catalysts play an important role in the electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction mechanism and structure&#8208;performance relationship of SASCs in 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR are discussed by combining characterization techniques and theoretical calculation.








Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a green oxidizing agent is widely used in various fields. Electrosynthesis of H2O2 has gradually become a hotspot due to its convenient and environment&#8208;friendly features. Single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with uniform active sites are the ideal catalysts for the in&#8208;depth study of the reaction mechanism and structure&#8208;performance relationship. In this review, the outstanding achievements of SASCs in the electrosynthesis of H2O2 through 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and 2e&#8722; water oxygen reaction (WOR) in recent years, are summarized. First, the elementary steps of the two pathways and the roles of key intermediates (*OOH and *OH) in the reactions are systematically discussed. Next, the influence of the size effect, electronic structure regulation, the support/interfacial effect, the optimization of coordination microenvironments, and the SASCs&#8208;derived catalysts applied in 2e&#8722; ORR are systematically analyzed. Besides, the developments of SASCs in 2e&#8722; WOR are also overviewed. Finally, the research progress of H2O2 electrosynthesis on SASCs is concluded, and an outlook on the rational design of SASCs is presented in conjunction with the design strategies and characterization techniques.

         <title>Structural Design for EMI Shielding: From Underlying Mechanisms to Common Pitfalls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve absorption&#8208;dominant electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields, detailed structural design is essential. This review examines various shielding configurations such as polymer nanocomposites, thin films, porous frameworks, multilayer constructs, and 3D&#8208;printed structures. It highlights key considerations for creating effective shields, explains fundamental shielding mechanisms, and addresses common misconceptions in EMI shielding science.








Abstract
Modern human civilization deeply relies on the rapid advancement of cutting&#8208;edge electronic systems that have revolutionized communication, education, aviation, and entertainment. However, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by digital systems poses a significant threat to the society, potentially leading to a future crisis. While numerous efforts are made to develop nanotechnological shielding systems to mitigate the detrimental effects of EMI, there is limited focus on creating absorption&#8208;dominant shielding solutions. Achieving absorption&#8208;dominant EMI shields requires careful structural design engineering, starting from the smallest components and considering the most effective electromagnetic wave attenuating factors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of shielding structures, emphasizing the critical elements of absorption&#8208;dominant shielding design, shielding mechanisms, limitations of both traditional and nanotechnological EMI shields, and common misconceptions about the foundational principles of EMI shielding science. This systematic review serves as a scientific guide for designing shielding structures that prioritize absorption, highlighting an often&#8208;overlooked aspect of shielding science.

         <title>Phospholipid Membranes as Chemically and Functionally Tunable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular membranes feature a couple of unique properties to control various biological functions at this interface. Protein function can be modulated by specific lipids directly or by bulk membrane properties. Using this principle, a number of advanced membrane&#8208;based applications are conceivable where the membrane acts as a modulator of biological function.








Abstract
The sheet&#8208;like lipid bilayer is the fundamental structural component of all cell membranes. Its building blocks are phospholipids and cholesterol. Their amphiphilic structure spontaneously leads to the formation of a bilayer in aqueous environment. Lipids are not just structural elements. Individual lipid species, the lipid membrane structure, and lipid dynamics influence and regulate membrane protein function. An exciting field is emerging where the membrane&#8208;associated material properties of different bilayer systems are used in designing innovative solutions for widespread applications across various fields, such as the food industry, cosmetics, nano&#8208; and biomedicine, drug storage and delivery, biotechnology, nano&#8208; and biosensors, and computing. Here, the authors summarize what is known about how lipids determine the properties and functions of biological membranes and how this has been or can be translated into innovative applications. Based on recent progress in the understanding of membrane structure, dynamics, and physical properties, a perspective is provided on how membrane&#8208;controlled regulation of protein functions can extend current applications and even offer new applications.

         <title>Mixing Insulating Commodity Polymers with Semiconducting n&#8208;type Polymers Enables High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulating commodity polymers are mixed with an n&#8208;type conjugated polymer to increase the performance of organic electrochemical transistors. Blending the conjugated polymer p(N&#8208;T) with large amounts of 10 kDa polystyrene (1:6 in monomer weight) led to an increase in electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude and device stability by 65% with respect to the pristine conjugated polymer.








Abstract
Diluting organic semiconductors with a host insulating polymer is used to increase the electronic mobility in organic electronic devices, such as thin film transistors, while considerably reducing material costs. In contrast to organic electronics, bioelectronic devices such as the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) rely on both electronic and ionic mobility for efficient operation, making it challenging to integrate hydrophobic polymers as the predominant blend component. This work shows that diluting the n&#8208;type conjugated polymer p(N&#8208;T) with high molecular weight polystyrene (10&#160;KDa) leads to OECTs with over three times better mobility&#8208;volumetric capacitance product (&#181;C*) with respect to the pristine p(N&#8208;T) (from 4.3 to 13.4 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) while drastically decreasing the amount of conjugated polymer (six times less). This improvement in &#181;C* is due to a dramatic increase in electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude, from 0.059 to 1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p(N&#8208;T):Polystyrene 10 KDa 1:6. Moreover, devices made with this polymer blend show better stability, retaining 77% of the initial drain current after 60 minutes operation in contrast to 12% for pristine p(N&#8208;T). These results open a new generation of low&#8208;cost organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors where the bulk of the film is made by a commodity polymer.

         <title>3D Nanostructuring of Phase&#8208;Change Materials Using Focused Ion Beam toward Versatile Optoelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local nanostructuring of phase&#8208;change thin films using a focused ion beam (FIB) is reported. The accurate control of FIB's milling/sputtering power for height/depth variations produces vibrant structural colors. The phase&#8208;switching of the active Sb2Se3 thin film provides additional contrast formation. The reported technique allows for the formation of super&#8208;resolution images with small pixel sizes.








Abstract
In recent&#160;years, phase&#8208;change materials have gained importance in nanophotonics and optoelectronics. Sizable optical contrast and added degree of freedom from phase switching drive the use of phase&#8208;change materials in various optical devices with outstanding results and potential for real&#8208;world applications. The local crystallization/amorphization of phase&#8208;change materials and the corresponding reflectance tuning by the crystallized/amorphized region size have potential applications, for example, for future dynamic display devices. Although the resolution is much higher than in current display devices, the pixel sizes in those devices are limited by the locally switchable structure size. Here, the spot sizes are further reduced by using ion beams instead of laser beams, dramatically increasing pixel density, demonstrating superior resolution. In addition, the power to sputter away materials can be utilized in creating nanostructures with relative height differences and local contrast. The experiment focuses on one archetypal phase&#8208;change material, Sb2Se3, prepared by pulsed&#8208;laser deposition on a reflective gold substrate. This study demonstrates that structural colors can be produced and reflectance tuning can be achieved by focused ion beam milling/sputtering of phase&#8208;change materials at the nanoscale. Furthermore, the local structuring of phase&#8208;change materials by focused ion beam can produce high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density display devices with superior resolutions.

         <title>Engineering of Local Coordination Microenvironment in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enabling Sustainable Conversion of Biomass into a Broad Range of Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst with highly active Pd&#8208;N3&#8208;Bx sites is facilely synthesized via a supramolecular controlled pyrolysis strategy. The local coordination microenvironment between Pd and N guarantees the formation of Pd&#8208;N3 active sites, whereas the self&#8208;doping B effectively adjusts the charge distribution around Pd&#8208;N3 sites. The resulting Pd1/BNC catalyst exhibits outstanding activity toward converting the lignocellulosic biomass into amines.








Abstract
Utilizing renewable biomass as a substitute for fossil resources to produce high&#8208;value chemicals with a low carbon footprint is an effective strategy for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Production of chemicals via single&#8208;atom catalysis is an attractive proposition due to its remarkable selectivity and high atomic efficiency. In this work, a supramolecular&#8208;controlled pyrolysis strategy is employed to fabricate a palladium single&#8208;atom (Pd1/BNC) catalyst with B&#8208;doped Pd&#8208;Nx atomic configuration. Owing to the meticulously tailored local coordination microenvironment, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd1/BNC catalyst exhibits remarkable conversion capability for a wide range of biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes/ketones. Thorough characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the highly polar metal&#8208;N&#8208;B site, formed between the central Pd single atom and its adjacent N and B atoms, promotes hydrogen activation from the donor (reductants) and hydrogen transfer to the acceptor (C&#9552;O group), consequently leading to exceptional selectivity.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; sites is facilely synthesized via a supramolecular controlled pyrolysis strategy. The local coordination microenvironment between Pd and N guarantees the formation of Pd-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; active sites, whereas the self-doping B effectively adjusts the charge distribution around Pd-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites. The resulting Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/BNC catalyst exhibits outstanding activity toward converting the lignocellulosic biomass into amines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing renewable biomass as a substitute for fossil resources to produce high-value chemicals with a low carbon footprint is an effective strategy for achieving a carbon-neutral society. Production of chemicals via single-atom catalysis is an attractive proposition due to its remarkable selectivity and high atomic efficiency. In this work, a supramolecular-controlled pyrolysis strategy is employed to fabricate a palladium single-atom (Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/BNC) catalyst with B-doped Pd-N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; atomic configuration. Owing to the meticulously tailored local coordination microenvironment, the as-synthesized Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/BNC catalyst exhibits remarkable conversion capability for a wide range of biomass-derived aldehydes/ketones.

         <title>Colossal Magnetoresistive Switching Induced by d0 Ferromagnetism of MgO in a Semiconductor Nanochannel Device with Ferromagnetic Fe/MgO Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous and colossal magneto&#8208;resistive switching with very high magnetic field dependence is demonstrated in a device composed of a Ge nanochannel with all&#8208;epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline Fe/MgO electrodes. The new phenomenon is attributed to the formation of d0&#8208;ferromagnetic filaments by attractive Mg vacancies due to the spin&#8208;triplet states with ferromagnetic double exchange interactions and the ferromagnetic proximity effect of Fe on MgO.








Abstract
Exploring potential spintronic functionalities in resistive switching (RS) devices is of great interest for creating new applications, such as multifunctional resistive random&#8208;access memory and novel neuromorphic computing devices. In particular, the importance of the spin&#8208;triplet state of cation vacancies in oxide materials, which is induced by localized and strong O&#8211;2p on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions, in RS devices has been overlooked. d0 ferromagnetism sometimes appears due to the spin&#8208;triplet state and ferromagnetic Zener's double exchange interactions between cation vacancies, which are occasionally strong enough to make nonmagnetic oxides ferromagnetic. Here, for the first time, anomalous and colossal magneto&#8208;RS (CMRS) with very high magnetic field dependence is demonstrated by utilizing an unconventional RS device composed of a Ge nanochannel with all&#8208;epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline Fe/MgO electrodes. The device shows colossal and unusual behavior as the threshold voltage and ON/OFF ratio strongly depend on a magnetic field, which is controllable with an applied voltage. This new phenomenon is attributed to the formation of d0&#8208;ferromagnetic filaments by attractive Mg vacancies due to the spin&#8208;triplet states with ferromagnetic double exchange interactions and the ferromagnetic proximity effect of Fe on MgO. The findings will allow the development of energy&#8208;efficient CMRS devices with multifield susceptibility.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy Reveals Na Infiltration into Separator Pore Free&#8208;Volume as a Degradation Mechanism in Na Anode:Liquid Electrolyte Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;sectional cryo&#8208;electron microscopy of full intact Na anode electrochemical cells reveals deeper understanding of degradation mechanism during electrochemical plating and stripping with liquid electrolytes. Na is observed to infiltrate the separator by growing into the free volume space of its pores rather than mechanical puncturing by dendrites.








Abstract
Batteries utilizing a sodium (Na) metal anode with a liquid electrolyte are promising for affordable large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, a deep understanding of the intrinsic degradation mechanisms is limited by challenges in accessing the buried interfaces. Here, cryogenic electron microscopy&#160;of intact electrode:separator:electrode stacks is performed and degradation and failure of symmetric Na||Na coin cells occurs through the infiltration of Na metal through the&#160;pores of the separator rather than by mechanical puncturing by dendrites is revealed. It is shown the interior structure of the cell (electrode:separator:electrode) must be preserved and&#160;deconstructing the cell into different layers for characterization results in artifacts. In intact cell stacks, minimal liquid is found between the electrodes and separator, leading to intimate electrode:separator interfaces. After electrochemical cycling, Na infiltrates into the pore free&#8208;volume, growing through the separator to create electrical shorts and degradation. The Na infiltration occurs at interfacial regions devoid of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), revealing SEI plays an important role in preventing Na from growing into the separator by being a physical barrier that the plated Na cannot penetrate. These results shed new light on the fundamental failure mechanisms in Na batteries and demonstrate the importance of preserving the cell structure and buried interfaces.

         <title>Silk&#8208;Fabric Reinforced Silk for Artificial Bones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk&#8208;fabric reinforced silk material (SFS) is prepared via a hot&#8208;pressing approach with degummed silk fabric as the reinforcement and silk fibroin as the matrix. SFS with a perfect interface has excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. SFS has great potential to replace commercial metal or ceramic implants to be used in the field of medical fracture repair.








Abstract
Bone implants for different body parts require varying mechanical properties, dimensions, and biodegradability rates. Currently, it is still challenging to produce artificial bones with perfect compatibility with human bones. In this study, a silk&#8208;fabric reinforced silk material (SFS) composed of pure silk with exceptional biocompatibility, osteogenesis, and biodegradability is reported, and demonstrates its outstanding performance as a bone implant material. The SFS is fabricated using a simple hot&#8208;pressing technique, with degummed silk fabric as the reinforcement and silk fibroin as the matrix. The SFS as a self&#8208;reinforced composite, has exceptional mechanical properties due to the almost perfect interface between the matrix and reinforcement. More importantly, its mechanical properties, biodegradability rates, and density can be tailored by adjusting the reinforcement structure and the ratio of the reinforcement to the matrix to align with the requirements for bone implantation in different parts of the human body. Besides, the SFS can improve osteoblastic proliferation and increase osteogenic activity, which is not the case with clinically used titanium alloy artificial bone. Therefore, the SFS holds significant potential to replace conventional metal or ceramic implants in the field of medical fracture repair.

         <title>Overcoming the Unfavorable Effects of &#8220;Boltzmann Tyranny:&#8221; Ultra&#8208;Low Subthreshold Swing in Organic Phototransistors via One&#8208;Transistor&#8208;One&#8208;Memristor Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture is proposed to overcome the 60&#160;mV/dec limit in the subthreshold swing (SS) in conventional organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SS of 18&#160;mV/decade.








Abstract
Organic phototransistors (OPTs), as photosensitive organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), have gained significant attention due to their pivotal roles in imaging, optical communication, and night vision. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the Boltzmann distribution of charge carriers, which constrains the average subthreshold swing (SSave) to a minimum of 60&#160;mV/decade at room temperature. In this study, an innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture is proposed to overcome the Boltzmann limit in conventional OFETs. By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SSave of 18&#160;mV/decade. Consequently, the 1T1R devices demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to photo illumination, with a high specific detectivity of 3.9 &#215; 109&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2, outperforming conventional OPTs (4.9 &#215; 104&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2) by more than four orders of magnitude. The 1T1R architecture presents a potentially universal solution for overcoming the detrimental effects of &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; setting the stage for the development of ultra&#8208;low SSave devices in various optoelectronic applications.

By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra-low SS&lt;sub&gt;ave&lt;/sub&gt; of 18&#160;mV/decade. Consequently, the 1T1R devices demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to photo illumination, with a high specific detectivity of 3.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming conventional OPTs (4.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) by more than four orders of magnitude. The 1T1R architecture presents a potentially universal solution for overcoming the detrimental effects of &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; setting the stage for the development of ultra-low SS&lt;sub&gt;ave&lt;/sub&gt; devices in various optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioengineered Ionic Liquid for Catheter&#8208;Directed Tissue Ablation, Drug Delivery, and Embolization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catheter&#8208;directed ILE is bioengineered and tested in animal models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, achieving chemical segmentectomy, improving the delivery of therapeutics, preventing infectious complications, and potentially increasing chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.








Abstract
Delivery of therapeutics to solid tumors with high bioavailability remains a challenge and is likely the main contributor to the ineffectiveness of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, a catheter&#8208;directed ionic liquid embolic (ILE) is bioengineered to achieve durable vascular embolization, uniform tissue ablation, and drug delivery in non&#8208;survival and survival porcine models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. To simulate the clinical scenario, rabbit VX2 orthotopic liver tumors are treated showing successful trans&#8208;arterial delivery of Nivolumab and effective tumor ablation. Furthermore, similar results are also observed in human ex vivo tumor tissue as well as significant susceptibility of highly resistant patient&#8208;derived bacteria is seen to ILE, suggesting that ILE can prevent abscess formation in embolized tissue. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, improve the delivery of therapeutics, prevent infectious complications, and potentially increase chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.

         <title>Actuating Liquid Crystals Rapidly and Reversibly by Using Chemical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical energy (fuels) and catalysis are used to drive reversible microactuation of liquid crystals and microbeads dispersed within them. Surface catalyzed reactions between H2 and O2 on Pd/Au surfaces are shown to drive rapid (occur within a second) and reversible reorientation of LCs over many cycles, resulting in reversible microactuation of beads using LC elastic forces.








Abstract
Microtubules and catalytic motor proteins underlie the microscale actuation of living materials, and they have been used in reconstituted systems to harness chemical energy to drive new states of organization of soft matter (e.g., liquid crystals (LCs)). Such materials, however, are fragile and challenging to translate to technological contexts. Rapid (sub&#8208;second) and reversible changes in the orientations of LCs at room temperature using reactions between gaseous hydrogen and oxygen that are catalyzed by Pd/Au surfaces are reported. Surface chemical analysis and computational chemistry studies confirm that dissociative adsorption of H2 on the Pd/Au films reduces preadsorbed O and generates 1 ML of adsorbed H, driving nitrile&#8208;containing LCs from a perpendicular to a planar orientation. Subsequent exposure to O2 leads to oxidation of the adsorbed H, reformation of adsorbed O on the Pd/Au surface, and a return of the LC to its initial orientation. The roles of surface composition and reaction kinetics in determining the LC dynamics are described along with a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of microactuation of beads. These results provide fresh ideas for utilizing chemical energy and catalysis to reversibly actuate functional LCs on the microscale.

         <title>In Vivo Stimulation of Therapeutic Antigen&#8208;Specific T Cells in an Artificial Lymph Node Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an injectable T cell&#8208;stimulating scaffold, the artificial lymph node (aLN), is developed that works with the host immune system to create an immunostimulatory niche. The aLN&#160;can activate and expand rare, antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells from fully na&#239;ve, endogenous populations. aLN stimulated cells are fully functional and synergize with immune checkpoint blockade to reduce tumor burden and prolong survival.








Abstract
T cells are critical mediators of antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and are common targets for immunotherapy. Biomaterial scaffolds have previously been used to stimulate antigen&#8208;presenting cells to elicit antigen&#8208;specific immune responses; however, structural and molecular features that directly stimulate and expand na&#239;ve, endogenous, tumor&#8208;specific T cells in vivo have not been defined. Here, an artificial lymph node (aLN) matrix is created, which consists of an extracellular matrix hydrogel conjugated with peptide&#8208;loaded&#8208;MHC complex (Signal 1), the co&#8208;stimulatory signal anti&#8208;CD28 (Signal 2), and a tethered IL&#8208;2 (Signal 3), that can bypass challenges faced by other approaches to activate T cells in situ such as vaccines. This dynamic immune&#8208;stimulating platform enables direct, in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation, as well as recruitment and coordination of host immune cells, providing an immuno&#8208;stimulatory microenvironment for antigen&#8208;specific T cell activation and expansion. Co&#8208;injecting the aLN with na&#239;ve, wild&#8208;type CD8+ T cells results in robust activation and expansion of tumor&#8208;targeted T cells that kill target cells and slow tumor growth in several distal tumor models. The aLN platform induces potent in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation without the need for ex vivo priming or expansion and enables in situ manipulation of antigen&#8208;specific responses for immunotherapies.

         <title>Spatial Photo&#8208;Patterning of Nematic Liquid Crystal Pretilt and its Application in Fabricating Flat Gradient&#8208;Index Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a method for 3D control of liquid crystal mesogens' orientation. A two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process sets both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation, enabling smooth orientational patterns, and can generate stable gradient&#8208;index lenses without the need for an applied fields. The method shows promise for creating advanced photonics, re&#8208;configurable optical devices, and actuated materials.








Abstract
Liquid crystals offer a dynamic platform for developing advanced photonics and soft actuation systems due to their unique and facile tunability and reconfigurability. Achieving precise spatial patterning of the liquid crystal alignment is critical to developing electro&#8208;optical devices, programmable origami, directed colloidal assembly, and controlling active matter. Here, a simple method is demonstrated to achieve continuous 3D control of the directions of liquid crystal mesogens using a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process. In the first step, polarized light sets the orientation in the plane of confining substrates; the second step uses unpolarized light of a prescribed dose to set the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation. The method enables smoothly varying orientational patterns with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. As a demonstration, the setup is used to create gradient&#8208;index lenses with parabolic refractive index profiles that remain stable without external electric fields. The lenses' focal length and sensitivity to light polarization are characterized through experimental and numerical methods. The findings pave the way for developing next&#8208;generation photonic devices and actuated materials, with potential applications in molecular self&#8208;assembly, re&#8208;configurable optics, and responsive&#160;matter.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Manganese&#8208;Based Bacterial Materials Synergistically Activate the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG) that exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is successfully engineered. This work provides valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Stimulating the cyclic guanosine monophophate(GMP)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a crucial strategy by which bacteria activate the tumor immune system. However, the limited stimulation capability poses significant challenges in advancing bacterial immunotherapy. Here, an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG (polyethylene glycol)) is engineered successfully, which exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by elevated ATP levels, this biohybrid material degrades, resulting in the release of divalent manganese ions (Mn2+) and subsequent bacteria exposure. This combination synergistically activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, as Mn2+ enhances the sensitivity of cGAS to the extracellular DNA (eDNA) secreted by the bacteria. The results of the in vivo experiments demonstrate that the biohybrid materials E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG and VNP20009@PDMC&#8208;PEG effectively inhibit the growth of subcutaneous melanoma in mice and in situ liver cancer in rabbits. Valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are provided here.

         <title>Molecular Design for Vertical Phase Distribution Modulation in High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effect of side&#8208;chain polarity on organic solar cells (OSCs) performance by synthesizing two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, ITIC&#8208;16F and ITIC&#8208;E. It shows that side&#8208;chain polarity influences component distribution within the photoactive layer, affecting excitation energy levels and charge transport. Incorporating ITIC&#8208;E significantly enhances power conversion efficiency to 19.4%, highlighting side&#8208;chain manipulation as a key strategy for OSC enhancement.








Abstract
Component distribution within the photoactive layer dictates the morphology and electronic structure and substantially influences the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a molecular design strategy is introduced to manipulate component and energetics distribution by adjusting side&#8208;chain polarity. Two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), ITIC&#8208;16F and ITIC&#8208;E, are synthesized by introducing different polar functional substituents onto the side chains of ITIC. The alterations result in different distribution tendencies in the bulk heterojunction film: ITIC&#8208;16F with intensified hydrophobicity aligns predominantly with the top surface, while ITIC&#8208;E with strong hydrophilicity gravitates toward the bottom. This divergence directly impacts the vertical distribution of the excitation energy levels, thereby influencing the excitation kinetics over extended time periods and larger spatial ranges including enhanced diffusion&#8208;mediated exciton dissociation and stimulated charge carrier transport. Benefitting from the favorable energy distribution, the device incorporating ITIC&#8208;E into the PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl blend showcases an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.4%. This work highlights side&#8208;chain polarity manipulation as a promising strategy for designing efficient NFA molecules and underscores the pivotal role of spatial energetics distribution in OSC performance.

         <title>The LiV3O8 Superlattice Cathode with Optimized Zinc Ion Insertion Chemistry for High Mass&#8208;Loading Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of zinc&#8208;ion batteries depends on resolving the sluggish transport kinetics of divalent Zn2+ and enhancing mass&#8208;loading performance. Herein, PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 superlattice nanosheets with enlarged interlayer spacing are manufactured to provide a large&#8208;rate and stable lifetime due to optimized Zn2+ insertion chemistry. Superior high mass&#8208;loading performance highlights superlattice electrode design strategy and PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 cathode application potential.








Abstract
Resolving the sluggish transport kinetics of divalent Zn2+ in the cathode lattice and improving mass&#8208;loading performance are crucial for advancing the zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) application. Herein, PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 superlattice nanosheets (PEO&#8208;LVO) with expanded interlayer spacing (1.16&#160;nm) are fabricated to provide a high&#8208;rate, stable lifetime, and large mass&#8208;loading cathode. The steady in&#8208;plane expansion without shrinkage after the first cycle, but reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion in PEO&#8208;LVO are demonstrated by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ characterizations. Moreover, the large capacity of PEO&#8208;LVO is traced back to the optimized Zn2+ insertion chemistry with increased Zn2+ storage ratio, which is facilitated by the interlayer PEO in lowering the Zn2+ diffusion barrier and increased number of active sites from additional interfaces, as anticipated by density functional theory. Due to the optimized ion insertion resulting in stalled interfacial byproducts and rapid kinetics, PEO&#8208;LVO achieves excellent high mass&#8208;loading performance (areal capacity up to 6.18 mAh cm&#8722;2 for freestanding electrode with 24&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 mass&#8208;loading and 2.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 130&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for conventional electrode with 27&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 mass&#8208;loading). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber&#8208;shaped AZIBs with high mass&#8208;loading woven into a fabric can power an electronic watch, highlighting the application potential of PEO&#8208;LVO cathode.

         <title>Engineered Surfaces That Promote Capture of Latent Proteins to Facilitate Integrin&#8208;Mediated Mechanical Activation of Growth Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An osteogenic platform that functions by capturing inactive growth factor molecules is engineered to overcome conventional challenges associated with the use of active growth factors. The platform triggers capture of inactive transforming growth factor beta&#8208;1 for its subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation which activates osteogenic downstream signaling in vitro and fully repairs critical&#8208;sized bone defect in vivo.








Abstract
Conventional osteogenic platforms utilize active growth factors to repair bone defects that are extensive in size, but they can adversely affect patient health. Here, an unconventional osteogenic platform is reported that functions by promoting capture of inactive osteogenic growth factor molecules to the site of cell growth for subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation, using a recombinant fragment of latent transforming growth factor beta&#8208;binding protein&#8208;1 (rLTBP1). It is shown that rLTBP1 binds to the growth&#8208;factor&#8208; and integrin&#8208;binding domains of fibronectin on poly(ethyl acrylate) surfaces, which immobilizes rLTBP1 and promotes the binding of latency associated peptide (LAP), within which inactive transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) is bound. rLTBP1 facilitates the interaction of LAP with integrin &#946;1 and the subsequent mechanically driven release of TGF&#8208;&#946;1 to stimulate canonical TGF&#8208;&#946;1 signaling, activating osteogenic marker expression in vitro and complete regeneration of a critical&#8208;sized bone defect in vivo.

Abstract
Control of nanomaterial dimensions with atomic precision through synthetic methods is essential to understanding and engineering of nanomaterials. For single&#8208;layer inorganic materials, size and shape controls have been achieved by self&#8208;assembly and surface&#8208;catalyzed reactions of building blocks deposited at a surface. However, the scope of nanostructures accessible by such approach is restricted by the limited choice of building blocks that can be thermally evaporated onto surfaces, such as atoms or thermostable molecules. Herein this limitation is bypassed by using mass&#8208;selected molecular ions obtained via electrospray ionization as building blocks to synthesize nanostructures that are inaccessible by conventional evaporation methods. As the first example, micron&#8208;scale production of MoS2 and WS2 nanoribbons and their heterostructures on graphene are shown by the self&#8208;assembly of asymmetrically shaped building blocks obtained from the electrospray. It is expected that judicious use of electrospray&#8208;generated building blocks would unlock access to previously inaccessible inorganic nanostructures.

         <title>Revealing Seed&#8208;Mediated Structural Evolution of Copper&#8208;Silicide Nanostructures: Generating Structured Current Collectors for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth mechanism behind the evolution of silicide nanostructures directly on Cu foil is elucidated, where the temperature&#8208;dependent phase evolution of CuxSiy proceeds from Cu&gt;Cu0.83Si0.17&gt;Cu5Si&gt;Cu15Si4. The Cu diffusion kinetics guide the morphological progression of silicides, revealing that the growth of 1D metal silicide nanowires proceeds through an in situ formed, Cu seed&#8208;mediated, self&#8208;catalytic process.








Abstract
Metal silicide thin films and nanostructures typically employed in electronics have recently gained significant attention in battery technology, where they are used as active or inactive materials. However, unlike thin films, the science behind the evolution of silicide nanostructures, especially 1D nanowires (NWs), is a key missing aspect. CuxSiy nanostructures synthesized by solvent vapor growth technique are studied as a model system to gain insights into metal silicide formation. The temperature&#8208;dependent phase evolution of CuxSiy structures proceeds from Cu&gt;Cu0.83Si0.17&gt;Cu5Si&gt;Cu15Si4. The role of Cu diffusion kinetics on the morphological progression of Cu silicides is studied, revealing that the growth of 1D metal silicide NWs proceeds through an in situ formed, Cu seed&#8208;mediated, self&#8208;catalytic process. The different CuxSiy morphologies synthesized are utilized as structured current collectors for K&#8208;ion battery anodes. Sb deposited by thermal evaporation upon Cu15Si4 tripod NWs and cube architectures exhibit reversible alloying capacities of 477.3 and 477.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at a C/5 rate. Furthermore, Sb deposited Cu15Si4 tripod NWs anode tested in Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries demonstrate reversible capacities of &#8776;518 and 495 mAh g&#8722;1.

         <title>Developing Hypoxia&#8208;Sensitive System via Designing Tumor&#8208;Targeted Fullerene&#8208;Based Photosensitizer for Multimodal Therapy of Deep Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ)&#160;is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds, which can target tumors and achieve specific drug release in tumors. The powerful nanotherapy system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy possesses satisfactory oncolytic efficacy for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been approved for clinic. However, powerless efficiency for deep hypoxic tumor therapy remains an enormous challenge for PDT. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) is rationally designed for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors. To enhance the accumulation and achieve specific drug release in tumor, the FTCD&#8208;SRGD is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds. With the exacerbated hypoxic microenvironment created by C70 consuming O2 for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), TPZ is activated to produce toxic radical species to ablate deep tumors, which achieves a synergistic treatment of C70&#8208;mediated PDT and hypoxia&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy. Additionally, given this hypoxia&#8208;sensitive system&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) activating anticancer cytotoxic T lymphocyte to result in more susceptible tumor to immunotherapy, FTCD&#8208;SRGD plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) fully inhibit deep hypoxic tumors by promoting infiltration of effector T cells in tumors. Collectively, it is the first time to develop a multimodal therapy system with fullerene&#8208;based hypoxia&#8208;sensitive PS for deep tumors. The powerful multimodal nanotherapeutic system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced PDT and immunotherapy to massacre deep hypoxic tumors can provide a paradigm to combat the present bottleneck of tumor therapy.

         <title>Synergistic Interaction between Metal Single&#8208;Atoms and Defective WO3&#8722;x Nanosheets for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of a strong synergistic effect between metal single&#8208;atoms and oxygen vacancies of WO3&#8722;x nanosheets can effectively boost the sonodyanimc therapy performance under ultrasound irradiation, thus realizing highly efficient cancer treatment.








Abstract
Although metal single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based nanomaterials are explored as sonosensitizers for sonodynamic therapy (SDT), they normally exhibit poor activities and need to combine with other therapeutic strategies. Herein, the deposition of metal SAs on oxygen vacancy (OV)&#8208;rich WO3&#8722;x nanosheets to generate a synergistic effect for efficient SDT is reported. Crystalline WO3 and OV&#8208;rich WO3&#8722;x nanosheets are first prepared by simple calcination of the WO3&#183;H2O nanosheets under an air and N2 atmosphere, respectively. Pt, Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni metal SAs are then deposited on WO3&#8722;x nanosheets to obtain metal SA&#8208;decorated WO3&#8722;x nanocomposites (M&#8208;WO3&#8722;x). Importantly, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x sonosensitizer exhibits a much higher activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced production of reactive oxygen species than that of the WO3&#8722;x and Cu SA&#8208;decorated WO3, which is also higher than other M&#8208;WO3&#8722;x nanosheets. Both the experimental and theoretical results suggest that the excellent SDT performance of the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x nanosheets should be attributed to the synergistic effect between Cu SAs and WO3&#8722;x OVs. Therefore, after polyethylene glycol modification, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x can quickly kill cancer cells in vitro and effectively eradicate tumors in vivo under US irradiation. Transcriptome sequencing analysis and further molecular validation suggest that the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x&#8208;mediated SDT&#8208;activated apoptosis and TNF signaling pathways are potential drivers of tumor apoptosis induction.

         <title>Ptychographic Nanoscale Imaging of the Magnetoelectric Coupling in Freestanding BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferroelectric and magnetic structure of a freestanding thin film of multiferroic bismuth ferrite are imaged with soft x&#8208;ray ptychography at the Fe L&#8208;edge. This scanning coherent diffractive imaging technique directly visualizes the strong magnetoelectric coupling between the antiferromagnetic spin cycloid and ferroelectric domains on the nanoscale.








Abstract
Understanding the magnetic and ferroelectric ordering of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials at the nanoscale necessitates a versatile imaging method with high spatial resolution. Here, soft X&#8208;ray ptychography is employed to simultaneously image the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domains in an 80&#160;nm thin freestanding film of the room&#8208;temperature multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO). The antiferromagnetic spin cycloid of period 64&#160;nm is resolved by reconstructing the corresponding resonant elastic X&#8208;ray scattering in real space and visualized together with mosaic&#8208;like ferroelectric domains in a linear dichroic contrast image at the Fe L3 edge. The measurements reveal a near perfect coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering by which the propagation direction of the spin cycloid is locked orthogonally to the ferroelectric polarization. In addition, the study evinces both a preference for in&#8208;plane propagation of the spin cycloid and changes of the ferroelectric polarization by 71&#176;&#160;between multiferroic domains in the epitaxial strain&#8208;free, freestanding BFO film. The results provide a direct visualization of the strong magnetoelectric coupling in BFO and of its fine multiferroic domain structure, emphasizing the potential of ptychographic imaging for the study of multiferroics and non&#8208;collinear magnetic materials with soft&#160;X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Octadecyl Gallate and Lipid&#8208;Modified MnSe2 Nanoparticles Enhance Radiosensitivity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Promote Radioprotection in Normal Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by using transcriptome data. Therefore, MnSe2&#8208;lipid with uniform sphere morphology and pH&#8208;responsive property is designed. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosenstivity and Se element reduces side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a widely used therapeutic strategy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is always limited by radioresistance of tumor tissues and side&#8208;effects on normal tissues. Herein, a signature based on four core genes of cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, is developed to predict prognosis and assess immune cell infiltration, indicating that the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in ESCC. A novel lipid&#8208;modified manganese diselenide nanoparticle (MnSe2&#8208;lipid) with extraordinarily uniform sphere morphology and tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness is developed to simultaneously overcome radioresistance and reduce side&#8208;effects of radiation. The uniform MnSe2 encapsulated lipid effectively achieves tumor accumulation. Octadecyl gallate on surface of MnSe2 forming pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;phenolic covalent realizes rapid degradation in TME. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosensitivity by generating reactive oxygen species induced by Fenton&#8208;like reaction and activating cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Spontaneously, selenium strengthens immune response by promoting secretion of cytokines and increasing white blood cells, and performs antioxidant activity to reduce side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy. Overall, this multifunctional remedy which is responsive to TME is capable of providing radiosensitivity by cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated immunostimulation and chemodynamic therapy, and radioprotection of normal tissues, is highlighted here to optimize ESCC treatment.

         <title>Supramolecular Lipid Nanoparticles Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition: A New Generation Delivery System of mRNA Vaccines For Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular lipid nanoparticles (SMLNP) are developed to codeliver mRNA and an adjuvant (R848) through host&#8722;guest recognition, showing brilliant potentials in cancer immunotherapy. SMLNP@mRNAOVA/R848 significantly increases the translation efficiency, stimulates DC maturation, and promotes antigen presentation, thus eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Excitingly, the antitumor performances of mRNA vaccine are further potentiated by synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation is a crucial process for antigen presentation and the initiation of T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses. Toll&#8208;like receptors play pivotal roles in stimulating DC maturation and promoting antigen presentation. Here, a novel message RNA (mRNA) cancer vaccine is reported that boosts antitumor efficacy by codelivering an mRNA encoding tumor antigen and a TLR7/8 agonist (R848) to DC using supramolecular lipid nanoparticles (SMLNP) as a delivery platform, in which a new ionizable lipid (N2&#8208;3L) remarkably enhances the translation efficiency of mRNA and a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;modified ionizable lipid (Lip&#8208;CD) encapsulates R848. The incorporation of R848 adjuvant into the mRNA vaccine through noncovalent host&#8211;guest complexation significantly promotes DC maturation and antigen presentation after vaccination, thus resulting in superior antitumor efficacy in vivo. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy is further boosted synergized with immune checkpoint blockade by potentiating the anticancer capability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrated in tumor sites. This work indicates that SMLNP shows brilliant potential as next&#8208;generation delivery system in the development of mRNA vaccines with high efficacy.

         <title>Designing Ultratough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels with Centimeter&#8208;Scale Fractocohesive Lengths via Inelastic Crack Blunting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fractocohesive length measures the flaw sensitivity of materials. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant the material is. Synthetic soft materials have short fractocohesive lengths, often around 1 mm. Highly flaw&#8208;insensitive single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous network of distributed chain lengths are designed, demonstrating a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels.








Abstract
Fractocohesive length, defined as the ratio of fracture toughness to work of fracture, measures the sensitivity of materials to fracture in the presence of flaws. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant and crack&#8208;resistant the hydrogel. For synthetic soft materials, the fractocohesive length is short, often on the scale of 1&#8197;mm. Here, highly flaw&#8208;insensitive (HFI) single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous polymer network of widely distributed chain lengths are designed. The HFI hydrogels demonstrate a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length of 2.21&#160;cm, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels, and an unprecedented fracture toughness of &#8776;13&#160;300 J m&#8722;2. The uncommon flaw insensitivity results from the inelastic crack blunting inherent to the highly inhomogeneous network. When the HFI hydrogel is stretched, a large number of short chains break while coiled long chains can disentangle, unwind, and straighten, producing large inelastic deformation that substantially blunts the crack tip in a plastic manner, thereby deconcentrating crack&#8208;tip stresses and blocking crack extension. The flaw&#8208;insensitive design strategy is applicable to various hydrogels such as polyacrylamide and poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels and enables the development of HFI soft composites.

         <title>Defect Passivation Refinement in Perovskite Photovoltaics: Achieving Efficiency over 45% under Low&#8208;Light and Low&#8208;Temperature Dual Extreme Conditions</title>

A refined defect passivation in perovskite films is designed, which shows a multi&#8208;interaction mechanism between the perovskite and passivator. The shift of molecular bonding upon cooling down the film leads to a stronger passivation of iodine/formamidine vacancies. Such mechanism on device under low&#8208;light and low&#8208;temperature conditions is further leveraged and a record efficiency over 45% with durable ambient stability is obtained.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics have emerged as the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;to&#8208;electricity technology. However, their practical application still suffers from energy loss induced by intrinsic defects within the perovskite lattice. Here, a refined defect passivation in perovskite films is designed, which shows a multi&#8208;interaction mechanism between the perovskite and passivator. Interestingly, a shift of molecular bonding is observed upon cooling down the film, leading to a stronger passivation of iodine/formamidine vacancies. Such mechanism on device under low&#8208;light and low&#8208;temperature conditions is further leveraged and a record efficiency over 45% with durable ambient stability (T90 &gt; 4000&#160;h) is obtained. The pioneer application of perovskite solar cells in above dual extreme conditions in this work reveals the key principles of designing functional groups for the passivators, and also demonstrates the capability of perovskites for diverse terrestrial energy conversion applications in demanding environments such as polar regions and outer space.

A feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs is proposed to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment. Under the catalysis of carboxylesterase, Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic ciprofloxacin derivative and chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
The presence of bacteria in tumor results in chemotherapeutic drug resistance and weakens the immune response in colorectal cancer. To overcome bacterium&#8208;induced chemotherapeutic drug resistance and potentiate antitumor immunity, herein a novel molecule Biotin&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;Cip&#8208;OH)&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;CPT)&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Nap (Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap) is rationally designed containing four functional motifs (i.e., a biotin motif for targeting, Phe&#8208;Phe(&#8208;Nap) motif for self&#8208;assembly, ciprofloxacin derivative (Cip&#8208;OH) motif for antibacterial effect, and camptothecin (CPT) motif for chemotherapy). Using the designed molecule, a novel strategy of intracellular enzymatic nanofiber formation and synergistic antibacterium&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy and immunotherapy is achieved. Under endocytosis mediated by highly expressed biotin receptor in colorectal cancer cell membrane and the catalysis of highly expressed carboxylesterase in the cytoplasm, this novel molecule can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic Cip&#8208;OH and chemotherapeutic drug CPT are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy towards colorectal cancer. This work offers a feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment.

         <title>Nanofluid&#8208;Guided Janus Membrane for High&#8208;Efficiency Electricity Generation from Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanoconfined ionic liquids&#8208;guided evaporation power generator achieves high&#8208;efficiency performance with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#181;A, and an ultra&#8208;high continuous operating time of 180 h, providing a new strategy for clean power generation technologies.








Abstract
Harvesting electricity from widespread water evaporation provides an alternative route to cleaner power generation technology. However, current evaporation power generation (EPG) mainly depends on the dissociation process of certain functional groups (e.g., SO3H) in water, which suffers from low power density and short&#8208;term output. Herein, the Janus membrane is prepared by combining nanofluid and water&#8208;grabbing material for EPG, where the nanoconfined ionic liquids (NCILs) serve as ion sources instead of the functional groups. Benefiting from the selective and fast transport of anions in NCILs, such EPG demonstrates excellent power performance with a voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#181;A, and a maximum power density of 16.55 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 while operating for at least 180 h consistently. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and surface potential analysis reveal the molecular mechanism, that is, the diffusion of Cl&#8722; anions during evaporation is much faster than that of cations, generating the voltage and current across the membrane. Furthermore, the device performs well in varying environmental conditions, including different water temperatures and sources of evaporating water, showcasing its adaptability and integrability. Overall, the nanofluid&#8208;guided Janus membrane can efficiently transform low&#8208;grade thermal energy in evaporation into electricity, showing a competitive advantage over other sustainable applied approaches.

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Efficiency of Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with In&#8208;Situ Interfacial Cross&#8208;Linked Modifier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>

Moisture&#8208;assisted crosslink of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane forms a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) protective layer that not only effectively passivates perovskite surface defect, but also significantly enhances device moisture stability.








Abstract
Inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is potential as the top cells in tandem configurations, owing to the ideal bandgap, good thermal and light stability of inorganic perovskites. However, challenges such as mismatch of energy levels between charge transport layer and perovskite, significant non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by surface defects, and poor water stability have led to the urgent need for further improvement in the performance of inverted inorganic PSCs. Herein, the fabrication of efficient and stable CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSCs through surface treatment of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTS), is reported. The silane groups in MPTS can in situ crosslink in the presence of moisture to build a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) network by Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds, which forms a hydrophobic layer on perovskite surface to inhibit water invasion. Additionally, &#8208;SH can strongly interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ at the perovskite surface, effectively minimizing interfacial charge recombination. Consequently, the efficiency of the inverted inorganic PSCs improves dramatically from 19.0% to 21.0% under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 illumination with MPTS treatment. Remarkably, perovskite films with crosslinked MPTS exhibit superior stability when soaking in water. The optimized PSC maintains 91% of its initial efficiency after aging 1000 h in ambient atmosphere, and 86% in 800 h of operational stability testing.

         <title>Sustained and Localized Drug Depot Release Using Radiation&#8208;Activated Scintillating Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clinical cancer treatment often involves X&#8208;ray radiation therapy, and spatially precise radiation treatment offers the possibility of improving the therapeutic window of systemic chemotherapies designed to be activated by irradiation. This work presents scintillating nanoparticles that generate light in response to irradiation, uncaging a reservoir of sustained chemotherapy release within tumor tissue while sparing off&#8208;target sites of toxicity.








Abstract
Clinical treatment of cancer commonly incorporates X&#8208;ray radiation therapy (XRT), and developing spatially precise radiation&#8208;activatable drug delivery strategies may improve XRT efficacy while limiting off&#8208;target toxicities associated with systemically administered drugs. Nevertheless, achieving this has been challenging thus far because strategies typically rely on radical species with short lifespans, and the inherent nature of hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironments may encourage spatially heterogeneous effects. It is hypothesized that the challenge could be bypassed by using scintillating nanoparticles that emit light upon X&#8208;ray absorption, locally forming therapeutic drug depots in tumor tissues. Thus a nanoparticle platform (Scintillating nanoparticle Drug Depot; SciDD) that enables the local release of cytotoxic payloads only after activation by XRT is developed, thereby limiting off&#8208;target toxicity. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, SciDD is used to deliver a microtubule&#8208;destabilizing payload MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E). With as little as a 2&#160;Gy local irradiation to tumors, MMAE payloads are released effectively to kill tumor cells. XRT&#8208;mediated drug release is demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models and showed efficacy over XRT alone (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.0001). This work shows that SciDD can act as a local drug depot with spatiotemporally controlled release of cancer therapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;Clinical cancer treatment often involves X-ray radiation therapy, and spatially precise radiation treatment offers the possibility of improving the therapeutic window of systemic chemotherapies designed to be activated by irradiation. This work presents scintillating nanoparticles that generate light in response to irradiation, uncaging a reservoir of sustained chemotherapy release within tumor tissue while sparing off-target sites of toxicity.

         <title>Acoustic Higher&#8208;Order Topological Insulators Induced by Orbital&#8208;Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Orbital&#8208;interactions between degenerate acoustic cavity modes are introduced to demonstrate versatile higher&#8208;order corner states and orbital&#8208;dependent edge states embedded in the bulk, opening the avenue for exploring orbital&#8208;related topological physics and sound&#8208;wave interaction beyond the single&#8208;orbital systems. It also provides new opportunities for the applications such as sound trapping and sensing.








Abstract
The discovery of higher&#8208;order topological insulator metamaterials, in analogy with their condensed&#8208;matter counterparts, has enabled various breakthroughs in photonics, mechanics, and acoustics. A common way of inducing higher&#8208;order topological wave phenomena is through pseudo&#8208;spins, which mimic the electron spins as a symmetry&#8208;breaking degree of freedom. Here, this work exploits degenerate orbitals in acoustic resonant cavities to demonstrate versatile, orbital&#8208;selective, higher&#8208;order topological corner states. Type&#8208;II corner states are theoretically investigated and experimentally demonstrated based on tailored orbital interactions, without the need for long&#8208;range hoppings that has so far served as a key ingredient for Type&#8208;II corner states in single&#8208;orbital systems. Due to the orthogonal nature of the degenerate p orbitals, this work also introduces a universal strategy to realize orbital&#8208;dependent edge modes, featuring high&#8208;Q edge states identified in bulk bands. These findings provide an understanding of the interplay between acoustic orbitals and topology, shedding light on orbital&#8208;related topological wave physics, as well as its applications for acoustic sensing and trapping.

         <title>Reversible Optical Control of Polarization in Epitaxial Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is accomplished in epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8722;xO3 (PZT) thin films using UV light. For single&#8208;domain films, a transient modulation of the polarization magnitude occurs, mediated by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers in the Schottky interface. In PZT films at the morphotropic phase boundary, room&#8208;temperature remanent optical poling is realized that can be reversed via thermal annealing.








Abstract
Light is an effective tool to probe the polarization and domain distribution in ferroelectric materials passively, that is, non&#8208;invasively, for example, via optical second harmonic generation (SHG). With the emergence of oxide electronics, there is now a strong demand to expand the role of light toward active control of the polarization. In this work, optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is demonstrated&#160;in prototypical epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8722;xO3 (PZT)&#8208;based heterostructures. This is accomplished in three steps, using above&#8208;bandgap UV light, while tracking the response of the polarization with optical SHG. First, it is found that UV&#8208;light exposure induces a transient enhancement or suppression of the ferroelectric polarization in films with an upward&#8208; or downward&#8208;oriented polarization, respectively. This behavior is attributed to a modified charge screening driven by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers at the Schottky interface of the ferroelectric thin film. Second, by taking advantage of this optical handle on electrostatics, remanent optical poling from a pristine multi&#8208;domain into a single&#8208;domain configuration is accomplished. Third, via thermal annealing or engineered electrostatic boundary conditions, a complete reversibility of the optical poling is further achieved. Hence, this work paves the way for the all&#8208;optical control of the spontaneous polarization in ferroelectric thin&#160;films.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling&#8208;Mediated Sequential Drug Delivery Potentiates Treatment Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) to specifically remodel the tumor microenvironment by combining coagulation and hypoxia. Apitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3, a nanocarrier for immunotherapy, subsequently recognizes and targets tumor coagulation. Under hypoxia, IMDQ is selectively activated. This strategy boosts delivery efficacy and reduces systemic toxicity of IMDQ. It successfully eradicates 4T1 and CT26 tumors (500 mm3) without recurrence.








Abstract
Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists, such as imidazoquinolines (IMDQs), are promising for the de novo priming of antitumor immunity. However, their systemic administration is severely limited due to the off&#8208;target toxicity. Here, this work describes a sequential drug delivery strategy. The formulation is composed of two sequential modules: a tumor microenvironment remodeling nanocarrier (poly(l&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4, termed CA4&#8208;NPs) and an immunotherapy nanocarrier (apcitide peptide&#8208;decorated poly(l&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 conjugate, termed apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3). CA4&#8208;NPs, as a vascular disrupting agent, are utilized to remodel the tumor microenvironment for enhancing tumor coagulation and hypoxia. Subsequently, the apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 could identify and target tumor coagulation through the binding of surface apcitide peptide to the GPIIb&#8208;IIIa on activated platelets. Afterward, IMDQ is activated selectively through the conversion of &#8220;&#8208;N3&#8221; to &#8220;&#8208;NH2&#8221; in the presence of hypoxia. The biodistribution results confirm their high tumor uptake of activated IMDQ (22.66%ID/g). By augmenting the priming and immunologic memory of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells, 4T1 and CT26 tumors with a size of &#8776;500 mm3 are eradicated without recurrence in mouse models.

         <title>Orbital Occupancy Modulation to Optimize Intermediate Absorption for Efficient Electrocatalysts in Water Electrolysis and Zinc&#8211;Ethanol&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the coordinating environment (coordinated atoms substitution and crystalline symmetry change) of the o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni is successfully regulated to optimize its dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy. Additionally, the transformation of the ligand field caused by the reconstruction further modulates the spin configuration of the catalyst and the moderate dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy enhances the ethanol oxidiation.








Abstract
Spin engineering is a promising way to modulate the interaction between the metal d&#8208;orbital and the intermediates and thus enhance the catalytic kinetics. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported to modulate the spin state of Co by regulating its coordinating environment. o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni is prepared as pre&#8208;catalyst, then in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)&#160;and in situ Raman spectroscopy are employed to prove phase transition, and CoOOH/Co3O4 is formed on the surface as active sites. In hybrid water electrolysis, the voltage has a negative shift, and in zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery, the charging voltage is lowered and the cycling stability is greatly increased. Coordinated atom substitution and crystalline symmetry change are combined to regulate the absorption ability of reaction intermediates with balanced optimal adsorption.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, the coordinating environment (coordinated atoms substitution and crystalline symmetry change) of the o-c-CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni is successfully regulated to optimize its d&lt;i&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; + d&lt;i&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; orbital occupancy. Additionally, the transformation of the ligand field caused by the reconstruction further modulates the spin configuration of the catalyst and the moderate d&lt;i&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; + d&lt;i&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; orbital occupancy enhances the ethanol oxidiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin engineering is a promising way to modulate the interaction between the metal d-orbital and the intermediates and thus enhance the catalytic kinetics. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported to modulate the spin state of Co by regulating its coordinating environment. o-c-CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni is prepared as pre-catalyst, then in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)&#160;and in situ Raman spectroscopy are employed to prove phase transition, and CoOOH/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is formed on the surface as active sites. In hybrid water electrolysis, the voltage has a negative shift, and in zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery, the charging voltage is lowered and the cycling stability is greatly increased. Coordinated atom substitution and crystalline symmetry change are combined to regulate the absorption ability of reaction intermediates with balanced optimal adsorption. Coordinated atom substitution weakens the adsorption while the crystalline symmetry change strengthens the adsorption. Importantly, the tetrahedral sites are introduced by Ni doping which enables the co-existence of four-coordinated sites and six-coordination sites in o-c-CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni. The d&lt;i&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; + d&lt;i&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; orbital occupancy decreases after the atomic substitution, while increases after replacing the CoSe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; field with CoSe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Highly Stable Organic Molecular Porous Solid Electrolyte with One&#8208;Dimensional Ion Migration Channel for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Battery</title>

Organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril as the solid&#8208;state electrolyte for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The 1D ion migration channel achieves the Li+ fast conduction and the noncovalent interactions facilitate the immobilization of anions, realizing Li+ uniform distribution, as well as endowing the solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries have been widely recognized as one of the candidates for the next&#8208;generation of energy storage batteries. However, the development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries has been hindered by the lack of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with high ionic conductivity at room temperature, high Li+ transference number, and the high stability to air. Herein, the organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with one&#8208;dimensional (1D)&#160;ion migration channels is developed as the SSE for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Taking advantage of the 1D ion migration channel for Li+ conduction, CB[7] SSE achieves high ionic conductivity (2.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the noncovalent interactions facilitated the immobilization of anions, realizing a high Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.81) and Li+ uniform distribution. The CB[7] SSE also shows a wide electrochemical stability window of 0&#8211;4.65&#160;V and high thermal stability and chemical stability, as well as realizes stable Li+ plating/stripping (more than 1000&#160;h at 0.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). As a result, the CB[7] SSE endows solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (up to 500&#160;h). This design strategy of CB[7] SSE paves the way for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries toward practical applications.

         <title>Van der Waals Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals (vdW) force has been regarded as a versatile and universal potential. Nevertheless, whether vdW force can be used as an attractive potential for the crystallization of colloids remains to be proven. Here, it is shown that the implementation of gold cores into silica colloids can reconfigure vdW force to optimal range in terms of colloidal crystallizations.








Abstract
A general guiding principle for colloidal crystallization is to tame the attractive enthalpy such that it slightly overwhelms the repulsive interaction. As&#8208;synthesized colloids are generally designed to retain a strong repulsive potential for the high stability of suspensions, encoding appropriate attractive potentials into colloids has been key to their crystallization. Despite the myriad of interparticle attractions for colloidal crystallization, the van der Waals (vdW) force remains unexplored. Here, it is shown that the implementation of gold cores into silica colloids and the resulting vdW force can reconfigure the pair potential well depth to the optimal range between &#8722;1 and &#8722;4 kBT at tens of nanometer&#8208;scale colloidal distances. As such, colloidal crystals with a distinct liquid gap can be formed, which is evidenced by photonic bandgap&#8208;based diffractive colorization.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Nanostructured Viologen&#8208;Siloxane Materials for Controllable Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable approach for tunable properties of viologen&#8208;siloxane block molecules is presented, where the counterion dictates morphology, domain spacing, and conductivity. A light&#8208;responsive counterion is used to reduce the viologen in situ, enhancing its conductivity. The radical cation is stable for several days and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. Repeated pulsed&#8208;light irradiation results in a continuum of conductive states, exhibiting behavior resemblant to long&#8208;term potentiation.








Abstract
Spontaneous phase separation is a promising strategy for the development of novel electronic materials, as the resulting well&#8208;defined morphologies generally exhibit enhanced conductivity. Making these structures adaptive to external stimuli is challenging, yet crucial as multistate reconfigurable switching is essential for neuromorphic materials. Here, a modular and scalable approach is presented to obtain switchable phase&#8208;separated viologen&#8208;siloxane nanostructures with sub&#8208;5&#160;nm features. The domain spacing, morphology, and conductivity of these materials can be tuned by ion exchange, repeated pulsed photoirradiation and electric stimulation. Counterion exchange triggers a postsynthetic modification in domain spacing of up to 10%. Additionally, in some cases, 2D to 1D order&#8211;order transitions are observed with the latter exhibiting a sevenfold decrease in conductivity with respect to their 2D lamellar counterparts. Moreover, the combination of the viologen core with tetraphenylborate counterions enables reversible and in situ reduction upon light irradiation. This light&#8208;driven reduction provides access to a continuum of conducting states, reminiscent of long&#8208;term potentiation. The repeated voltage sweeps improve the nanostructures alignment, leading to increased conductivity in a learning effect. Overall, these results highlight the adaptivity of phase&#8208;separated nanostructures for the next generation of organic electronics, with exciting applications in smart sensors and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Ultraflexible Temperature&#8208;Strain Dual&#8208;Sensor Based on Chalcogenide Glass&#8208;Polymer Film for Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll strategy is developed for fabricating ultraflexible thermoelectric films with superior temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing performance, and a prototypical robotic hand for intelligent action feedback and temperature alarm is demonstrated. This work not only brings new inspiration for wearable inorganic thermoelectric devices, but also sets the stage for a wide implementation of multifunctional human&#8208;machine interaction systems.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like thermoelectric (TE) films with temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing functions are highly desirable for human&#8208;machine interaction systems and wearable devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin-like thermoelectric (TE) films with temperature- and strain-sensing functions are highly desirable for human-machine interaction systems and wearable devices. However, current TE films still face challenges in achieving high flexibility and excellent sensing performance simultaneously. Herein, for the first time, a facile roll-to-roll strategy is proposed to fabricate an ultraflexible chalcogenide glass-polytetrafluoroethylene composite film with superior temperature- and strain-sensing performance.

         <title>Fast Li Replenishment Channels&#8208;Assisted Recycling of Degraded Layered Cathodes with Enhanced Cycling Performance and Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiCo0.5Mn0.5BO3 (LCMB) coating bonds with the rock salt/spinel phase on degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523), forming new Li replenishment channels with a reduced diffusion energy barrier. Therefore, a very small amount of LiOH and short&#8208;time sintering are adequate for fully regeneration. The repaired LCMB&#8208;NCM523 presents high discharge specific capacity and excellent cycling performance and thermal stability.








Abstract
The direct recycling of cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is important for environmental protection and resource conservation. The key regeneration processes are composition replenishment and atom rearrangement, both of which depend on the migration and diffusion of atoms. However, for the direct recycling of degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (D&#8208;NCM523) cathode, the irreversible phase transitions that accumulate during the long&#8208;term cycles block the Li diffusion channels with a high diffusion energy barrier, making it difficult to fully repair the layered structure and resulting in rapid capacity decay. To address the challenge, fast Li replenishment channels are rebuilt to regulate the surface phase and effectively assist the regeneration process with a reduced energy barrier. This method reduces the amount of Li supplement by &gt;75% and shortens the sintering time (only 2&#160;h) to fully regenerate D&#8208;NCM523, compared to general direct recycling methods. The regenerated NCM523 (LCMB&#8208;NCM523) exhibits a satisfactory repaired specific capacity of 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability, retaining 78% of its capacity after 300 cycles. In addition, LCMB&#8208;NCM523 is recycled with improved thermal decomposition peak temperature and enables 200 cycles even at 60&#160;&#176;C, greatly improving safety. This work proposes a promising way for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of layered cathodes.

         <title>Polymeric Conductive Adhesive&#8208;Based Ultrathin Epidermal Electrodes for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Electrophysiological Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin conductive adhesive&#8208;based epidermal electrode with enhanced adhesion and intrinsic stretchability, optimizing conformity even during movement and ensuring prolonged sustainability, is demonstrated. A theoretical analysis is also conducted to design the electrode materials and design. By these efforts, continuous monitoring of ECG signals is conducted for 168 h (1 week) without any significant motion artifacts and signal degradation.








Abstract
Electrophysiology, exploring vital electrical phenomena in living organisms, anticipates broader integration into daily life through wearable devices and epidermal electrodes. However, addressing the challenges of the electrode durability and motion artifacts is essential to enable continuous and long&#8208;term biopotential signal monitoring, presenting a hurdle for its seamless implementation in daily life. To address these challenges, an ultrathin polymeric conductive adhesive,&#160;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/polyvinyl alcohol/d&#8208;sorbitol (PPd) electrode with enhanced adhesion, stretchability, and skin conformability, is presented. The skin conformability and stability of electrodes is designed by theoretical criteria obtained by mechanical analysis.&#160;Thus, impedance stability is obtained over 1&#8208;week of daily life, and the PPd electrode addresses the challenges related to durability during prolonged usage. Proving stability in electromyography (EMG) signals during high&#8208;intensity exercise, the wireless PPd measurement system exhibits high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) signals even in situations involving significant and repetitive skin deformation. Throughout continuous 1 week&#8208;long electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life, the system consistently preserves signal quality, underscoring the heightened durability and applicability of the PPd measurement system.

         <title>3D Printing of Double Network Granular Elastomers with Locally Varying Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ink composed of jammed precursor&#8208;loaded elastomeric microparticles that can be direct ink written into double network granular elastomers that can attain a wide range of stiffnesses and ultimate tensile strains is presented. Inks with different stiffnesses can be 3D printed into cm&#8208;sized structures with locally varying compositions and hence mechanical properties using commercial multinozzle 3D printers.








Abstract
Fast advances in the design of soft actuators and robots demand for new soft materials whose mechanical properties can be changed over short length scales. Elastomers can be formulated as highly stretchable or rather stiff materials and hence, are attractive for these applications. They are most frequently cast such that their composition cannot be changed over short length scales. A method that allows to locally change the composition of elastomers on hundreds of micrometer lengths scales is direct ink writing (DIW). Unfortunately, in the absence of rheomodifiers, most elastomer precursors cannot be printed through DIW. Here, 3D printable double network granular elastomers (DNGEs) whose ultimate tensile strain and stiffness can be varied over an unprecedented range are introduced. The 3D printability of these materials is leveraged to produce an elastomer finger containing rigid bones that are surrounded by a soft skin. Similarly, the rheological properties of the microparticle&#8208;based precursors are leveraged to cast elastomer slabs with locally varying stiffnesses that deform and twist in a predefined fashion. These DNGEs are foreseen to open up new avenues in the design of the next generation of smart wearables, strain sensors, prosthesis, soft actuators, and robots.

         <title>Anisotropic Morphing in Bistable Kirigami through Symmetry Breaking and Geometric Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry breaking of slit pattern in bistable kirigami metamaterials is leveraged to generate geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape deployment. The role played by symmetry groups in the nonuniform scaling of bistable kirigami metamaterials is first mapped in the entire morphing space and then harnessed as design strategy for demonstrating arbitrary scaled bistable deployment.








Abstract
Shape morphing in bistable kirigami enables remarkable functionalities appealing to a diverse range of applications across the spectrum of length scale. At the core of their shape shifting lies the architecture of their repeating unit, where highly deformable slits and quasi&#8208;rigid rotating units often exhibit multiple symmetries that confer isotropic deployment obeying uniform scaling transformation. In this work, symmetry breaking in bistable kirigami is investigated to access geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing, enabling arbitrarily scaled deployment in planar and spatial bistable domains. With an analysis on their symmetry properties complemented by a systematic investigation integrating semi&#8208;analytical derivations, numerical simulations, and experiments on elastic kirigami sheets, this work unveils the fundamental relations between slit symmetry, geometric frustration, and anisotropic bistable deployment. Furthermore, asymmetric kirigami units are leveraged in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D demonstrations to showcase the pivotal role of shear deformation in achieving target shapes and functions so far unattainable with uniformly stretchable kirigami. The insights provided in this work unveil the role of slit symmetry breaking in controlling the anisotropic bistable deployment of soft kirigami metamaterials, enriching the range of achievable functionalities for applications spanning deployable space structures, wearable technologies, and soft machines.

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation and Cascaded Sum Frequency Generation from a Surface Crystallized Glass Ceramic Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and cascaded sum frequency generation (CSFG) are demonstrated in microspheres made of surface crystallized glass ceramics. Owing to random quasi&#8208;phase matching, ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860 to 1600&#160;nm is demonstrated. The microspheres also boost the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of CSFG.








Abstract
The development of novel materials and structures for efficient second&#8208;order nonlinear micro/nano devices remains a significant challenge. In this study, the remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and cascaded sum frequency generation in whispering gallery mode microspheres made of surface&#8208;crystallized glass with a 6&#8208;&#181;m Ba2TiSi2O8 crystal layer are demonstrated. Attributed to the core&#8211;shell design, the Ba2TiSi2O8 located on the surface can be efficiently coupled with whispering gallery modes, resulting in a highly efficient micron&#8208;scale cavity&#8208;enhanced second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity. Greatly enhanced SHG of the microcavity is observed, which is up to 80 times stronger than that of a non&#8208;resonant sample. Furthermore, owing to the wavelength non&#8208;selectivity of random quasi&#8208;phase matching, ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860 to 1600&#160;nm and high&#8208;contrast polarization characteristics is demonstrated. The glass&#8208;ceramic&#8208;based microsphere cavity also boosts the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of cascaded sum frequency generation. This work delineates an efficient strategy for boosting nonlinear optical response in glass ceramics, which will open up new opportunities for applications in photonics and optical communications.

         <title>Enhanced Piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 by the Introduction of MXene and Its Utilization in Boosting High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research details a strategy to boost the piezoelectric performance of MAPbI3 by using a MXene substrate. It is demonstrated that the surface OH groups on the MXene induce a stronger polarization of the MA+ ions in the MAPbI3 compared to that of the O and F groups, leading to a much more enhanced piezoelectric effect. An innovative type of flexible photodetector (PD) based on a piezoelectric MXene/MAPbI3 heterostructure is crafted, which can be enhanced simultaneously by the piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects. Utilizing MXene to boost the piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 reveals wide&#8208;range potentials for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Recently, perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are risen to prominence due to substantial research interest. Beyond merely tweaking the composition of materials, a cutting&#8208;edge advancement lies in leveraging the innate piezoelectric polarization properties of perovskites themselves. Here, the investigation shows utilizing Ti3C2Tx, a typical MXene, as an intermediate layer for significantly boosting the piezoelectric property of MAPbI3 thin films. This improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced polarization of the methylammonium (MA+) groups within MAPbI3, induced by the OH groups present in Ti3C2Tx. A flexible PD based on the MAPbI3/MXene heterostructure is then fabricated. The new device is sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths, displays greatly enhanced performance owing to the piezo&#8208;phototronic coupling. Moreover, the device is endowed with a greatly reduced response time, down to millisecond level, through the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect. The characterization shows applying a &#8722;1.2% compressive strain on the PD leads to a remarkable 102% increase in the common photocurrent, and a 76% increase in the pyro&#8208;phototronic current. The present work reveals how the emerging piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects can be employed to design high&#8208;performance flexible perovskite PDs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Stress and Strain Polymer Nanocomposite Actuators Incorporating a Mutually&#8208;Interpenetrated, Collective&#8208;Deformation Carbon Nanotube Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collective strategy for fabricating nanocomposites is demonstrated by incorporating a carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge into a SMP matrix. The synergistic deformation and actuation lead to extraordinary performance, including high output stress, strain, and fast response, surpassing the majority of conventional SMP&#8208;based composites and suggesting promising applications such as artificial muscles and low&#8208;temperature biomedical devices.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;based actuators are extensively studied, with the challenging goal of achieving comprehensive performance metrics that include large output stress and strain, fast response, and versatile actuation modes. The design and fabrication of nanocomposites offer a promising route to integrate the advantages of both polymers and nanoscale fillers, thus ensuring superior performance. Here, it is started from a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous sponge to fabricate a mutually interpenetrated nanocomposite, in which the embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) network undergoes collective deformation with the shape memory polymer (SMP) matrix during large&#8208;degree stretching and releasing, increases junction density with polymer chains and enhances molecular orientation. These features result in substantial improvement of the overall mechanical properties and during thermally actuated contraction, the bulk SMP/CNT composites exhibit output stresses up to 19.5 &#177; 0.97&#160;MPa and strains up to 69%, accompanied by a rapid response and high energy density, exceeding the majority of recent reports. Furthermore, electrical actuation is also demonstrated via uniform Joule heating across the self&#8208;percolated CNT network. Applications such as low&#8208;temperature thermal actuated vascular stent and wound dressing are explored. These findings lay out a universal blueprint for developing robust and highly deformable SMP/CNT nanocomposite actuators with broad potential applications.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Attention Network Based Spectral Reconstruction with Snapshot Near&#8208;Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A snapshot spectral imaging system that employs a compact near&#8208;infrared (NIR) metasurface composed of 25 distinct C4 symmetry structures is proposed, and a novel meta&#8208;attention network prior iterative denoising reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the hyperspectral images. By leveraging the system, the NIR spectral images which exhibit precise textures and negligible crosstalk are precisely reconstructed.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral information is important for detecting and analyzing material compositions. However, snapshot NIR spectral imaging systems still pose significant challenges owing to the lack of high&#8208;performance NIR filters and bulky setups, preventing effective encoding and integration with mobile devices. This study introduces a snapshot spectral imaging system that employs a compact NIR metasurface featuring 25 distinct C4 symmetry structures. Benefitting from the sufficient spectral variety and low correlation coefficient among these structures, center&#8208;wavelength accuracy of 0.05&#160;nm and full width at half maximum accuracy of 0.13&#160;nm are realized. The system maintains good performance within an incident angle of 1&#176;. A novel meta&#8208;attention network prior iterative denoising reconstruction (MAN&#8208;IDR) algorithm is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality NIR spectral imaging. By leveraging the designed metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR, the NIR spectral images, exhibiting precise textures, minimal artifacts in the spatial dimension, and little crosstalk between spectral channels, are reconstructed from a single grayscale recording image. The proposed NIR metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR hold great promise for further integration with smartphones and drones, guaranteeing the adoption of NIR spectral imaging in real&#8208;world scenarios such as aerospace, health diagnostics, and machine vision.

         <title>Spatial Structure Design of Thioether&#8208;Linked Naphthoquinone Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>

The naphthoquinone derivative isomers with nonplanar and partially conjugated structures have been designed to guarantee high structure stability and redox unit independence, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with high achievable capacity, stable cycling performance, and ultrarapid rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have gathered extensive attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their structural diversity and molecular designability. However, the reported research mainly focuses on the design of the planar configuration of OEMs and does not take into account the important influence of the spatial structure on the electrochemical properties, which seriously hamper the further performance liberation of OEMs. Herein, this work has designed a series of thioether&#8208;linked naphthoquinone&#8208;derived isomers with tunable spatial structures and applied them as the cathodes in AZIBs. The incomplete conjugated structure of the elaborately engineered isomers can guarantee the independence of the redox reaction of active groups, which contributes to the full utilization of active sites and high redox reversibility. In addition, the position isomerization of naphthoquinones on the benzene rings changes the zincophilic activity and redox kinetics of the isomers, signifying the importance of spatial structure on the electrochemical performance. As a result, the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenedithio) bis(1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone) (p&#8208;PNQ) with the smallest steric hindrance and the most independent redox of active sites exhibits a high specific capacity (279 mAh g&#8722;1), an outstanding rate capability (167 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1), and a long&#8208;term cycling lifetime (over 2800&#160;h at 0.05 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Eliminating the Burn&#8208;in Loss of Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells by Applying Dimer Acceptors as Supramolecular Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reliable dimer supramolecular stabilizer strategy is developed to eliminate the burn&#8208;in loss of organic solar cells (OSCs). More mechanism studies reveal that the restricted molecular diffusion, robust morphology, and low&#8208;level trap state density are keys to address the burn&#8208;in loss, resulting in a long T98 lifetime over 600 h under the maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking (MPPT) with a PCE over 19%.








Abstract
The meta&#8208;stable active layer morphology of organic solar cells (OSCs) is identified as the main cause of the rapid burn&#8208;in loss of power conversion efficiency (PCE) during long&#8208;term device operation. However, effective strategies to eliminate the associated loss mechanisms from the initial stage of device operation are still lacking, especially for high&#8208;efficiency material systems. Herein, the introduction of molecularly engineered dimer acceptors with adjustable thermal transition properties into the active layer of OSCs to serve as supramolecular stabilizers for regulating the thermal transitions and optimizing the crystallization of the absorber composites is reported. By establishing intimate &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with small&#8208;molecule acceptors, these stabilizers can effectively reduce the trap&#8208;state density (Nt) in the devices to achieve excellent PCEs over 19%. More importantly, the low Nt associated with an initially optimized morphology can be maintained under external stresses to significantly reduce the PCE burn&#8208;in loss in devices. This research reveals a judicious approach to improving OPV stability by establishing a comprehensive correlation between material properties, active&#8208;layer morphology, and device performance, for developing burn&#8208;in&#8208;free OSCs.

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Performance in Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Through Hydrogen Bond Suppression of Organic Cation Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High background carrier density in FASnI3 transistors is elucidated, originating from both Sn2+ oxidation and FA+ ion migration. The development of a hydrogen bond strategy through the integration of fluorine&#8208;substituted additives effectively suppresses cation migration, thereby reducing background carrier density and enhancing operational stability of the transistors. An impressive effective mobility of 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is achieved.








Abstract
Ion migration poses a substantial challenge in perovskite transistors, exerting detrimental effects on hysteresis and operational stability. This study focuses on elucidating the influence of ion migration on the performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). It is revealed that the high background carrier density in FASnI3 FETs arises not only from the oxidation of Sn2+ but also from the migration of FA+ ions. The formation of hydrogen bonding between FA+ and F&#8722; ions efficiently inhibits ion migration, leading to a reduction in background carrier density and an improvement in the operational stability of the transistors. The strategy of hydrogen bond is extended to fluorine&#8208;substituted additives to improve device performance. The incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium iodide additives into FETs significantly minimizes the shift of turn&#8208;on voltage during cyclic measurements. Notably, an effective mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with an Ion/off ratio of 107 is achieved. These findings hold promising potential for advancing tin&#8208;based perovskite technology in the field of electronics.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Template&#8208;Assisted Mechanical Exfoliation of Large&#8208;Area 2D Layers Enables Efficient and Precise Construction of Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of large&#8208;area 2D monolayers or few layers, including semiconductors, superconductors, and magnets, with high production yield are successfully exfoliated by a gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted mechanical exfoliation method. Various moir&#233; superlattices, including twisted homobilayers, twisted heterobilayers, and twisted multilayer superlattices, are efficiently and precisely constructed by picking&#8208;up and stacking these 2D layers using a dry&#8208;transfer method.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, consisting of rotationally aligned 2D atomically thin layers, provide a highly novel platform for the study of correlated quantum phenomena. However, reliable and efficient construction of moir&#233; superlattices is challenging because of difficulties to accurately angle&#8208;align small exfoliated 2D layers and the need to shun wet&#8208;transfer processes. Here, efficient and precise construction of various moir&#233; superlattices is demonstrated by picking up and stacking large&#8208;area 2D mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer crystals with predetermined crystal axes, made possible by a gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted mechanical exfoliation method. The exfoliated 2D layers are semiconductors, superconductors, or magnets and their high quality is confirmed by photoluminescence and Raman spectra and by electrical transport measurements of fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors and Hall devices. Twisted homobilayers with angle&#8208;twisting accuracy of &#8776;0.3&#176;, twisted heterobilayers with sub&#8208;degree angle&#8208;alignment accuracy, and multilayer superlattices are precisely constructed and characterized by their moir&#233; patterns, interlayer excitons, and second harmonic generation. The present study paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena in moir&#233; superlattices.

         <title>Area&#8208;Selective Chemical Vapor Deposition of Gold by Electron Beam Seeding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an area&#8208;selective chemical vapor deposition of gold is demonstrated. A metal&#8211;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 is used to create an autocatalytically active seed layer by electron beam deposition for further film growth at sub&#8208;100 &#176;C temperatures. In addition, this process provides a novel method for determining local temperature increases during electron beam writing.








Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing high&#8208;purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre&#8208; and post&#8208;processing using a mask to produce structures. This study presents a novel maskless patterning technique that enables area&#8208;selective CVD of gold. A focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal&#8211;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure can be included in the same CVD process without the need for clean room lithographic processing. Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80 &#176;C, over 200&#160;K lower than standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios of &#8776;40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their surface. Furthermore, by using the onset of the autocatalytic CVD growth, for the first time the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with an electron beam can be precisely&#160;determined.

         <title>Mechanical Control of Quantum Transport in Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. This work opens opportunities to harness straintronics effects in 2DM quantum technologies.








Abstract
2D materials (2DMs) are fundamentally electro&#8208;mechanical systems. Their environment unavoidably strains them and modifies their quantum transport properties. For instance, a simple uniaxial strain can completely turn off the conductance of ballistic graphene or switch on/off the superconducting phase of magic&#8208;angle bilayer graphene. This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. A scalar potential is mechanically induced in situ to modify graphene's work function by up to 25 meV. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. The data are measured with a custom experimental platform able to precisely tune both the mechanics and electrostatics of suspended graphene transistors at low&#8208;temperature over a broad range of strain (up to 2.6%). This work opens many opportunities to harness quantitative strain effects in 2DM quantum transport and&#160;technologies.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Hindrance Engineering of A Cation toward &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskite with Minimized Tilting and High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D&#160;EPZPbBr4 (EPZ = 1&#8208;ethylpiperazine) perovskite with minimized tilting and interlayer distance is designed through A&#8208;site stereo&#8208;hindrance engineering. The piperazine functional group pushes Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb closer to a straight line (maximum Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb angle &#8776;180&#176;), suppressing the tilting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The EPZPbBr4 X&#8208;ray detector exhibits specific detectivity of 1.23 &#215; 108 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 A&#8722;1/2.








Abstract
2D &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented Dion&#8211;Jacobson or Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are widely recognized as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. However, the large interlayer spacing significantly hinders the carrier transport. &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites naturally exhibit reduced interlayer spacings, but the tilting of metal halide octahedra is typically serious and leads to poor charge transport. Herein, a &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskite EPZPbBr4 (EPZ = 1&#8208;ethylpiperazine) with minimized tilting is designed through A&#8208;site stereo&#8208;hindrance engineering. The piperazine functional group enters the space enclosed by the three [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedra, pushing Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb closer to a straight line (maximum Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb angle &#8776;180&#176;), suppressing the tilting as well as electron&#8211;phonon coupling. Meanwhile, the ethyl group is located between layers and contributes an extremely reduced effective interlayer distance (2.22 &#197;), further facilitating the carrier transport. As a result, EPZPbBr4 simultaneously demonstrates high &#181;&#964; product (1.8 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) and large resistivity (2.17 &#215; 1010 &#937; cm). The assembled X&#8208;ray detector achieves low dark current of 1.02 &#215; 10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2 and high sensitivity of 1240 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under the same bias voltage. The realized specific detectivity (ratio of sensitivity to noise current density, 1.23 &#215; 108 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 A&#8722;1/2) is the highest among all reported perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Femtosecond Electron Diffraction Reveals Local Disorder and Local Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations, and TDDFT&#8208;MD simulations, the local disorder and local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe are identified exclusively, indicating a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel. The use of femtosecond electron diffraction is demonstrated to detect nonequilibrium structural dynamics in crystalline&#8208;disordered materials and reveal the intrinsic local disorder and local anharmonicity with femtosecond&#8208;picometer temporospatial resolution.








Abstract
In addition to long&#8208;range periodicity, local disorder, with local structures deviating from the average lattice structure, dominates the physical properties of phonons, electrons, and spin subsystems in crystalline functional materials. Experimentally characterizing the 3D atomic configuration of such a local disorder and correlating it with advanced functions remains challenging. Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations, and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations, the static local disorder and its local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe are identified exclusively. The ultrafast structural dynamics reveal that the crystalline SnSe is composed of multiple locally correlated configurations dominated by the static off&#8208;symmetry displacements of Sn (&#8776;0.4 &#197;) and such a set of locally correlated structures is termed local disorder. Moreover, the anharmonicity of this local disorder induces an ultrafast atomic displacement within 100 fs, indicating the signature of probable THz Einstein oscillators. The identified local disorder and local anharmonicity suggest a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel, which updates the fundamental insight into the long&#8208;debated ultralow thermal conductivity of SnSe. The method of revealing the 3D local disorder and the locally correlated interactions by ultrafast structural dynamics will inspire broad interest in the construction of structure&#8211;property relationships in material science.

         <title>Rational Design of Multinary Metal Chalcogenide Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 Nanocrystals for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;lifetime potassium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the significant volume expansion and sluggish kinetics of anode materials for large&#8208;sized K&#8208;ion storage. In this study, a ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene composite is designed with exceptional electronic/ionic conductivity, limited volume changes, enabling high K&#8208;storage capacity, ultrafast and highly durable potassium storage.








Abstract
Multinary metal chalcogenides hold considerable promise for high&#8208;energy potassium storage due to their numerous redox reactions. However, challenges arise from issues such as volume expansion and sluggish kinetics. Here, a design featuring a layered ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 anchored on graphene layers as a composite anode, where Bi atoms act as a lattice softening agent on Sb, is presented. Benefiting from the lattice arrangement in Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 and structure, Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene exhibits a mitigated expansion of 28% during the potassiation/depotassiation process and demonstrates facile K+ ion transfer kinetics, enabling long&#8208;term durability of 500 cycles at various high rates. Operando synchrotron diffraction patterns and spectroscopies including in situ Raman, ex situ adsorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron reveal multiple conversion and alloying/dealloying reactions for potassium storage at the atomic level. In addition, both theoretical calculations and electrochemical examinations elucidate the K+ migration pathways and indicate a reduction in energy barriers within Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene, thereby suggesting enhanced diffusion kinetics for K+. These findings provide insight in the design of durable high&#8208;energy multinary tellurides for potassium storage.

         <title>Touchless Thermosensation Enabled by Flexible Infrared Photothermoelectric Detector for Temperature Prewarning Function of Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize the touchless thermosensation function of e&#8208;skin, a flexible and wearable infrared detector is developed, based on the photothermoelectric coupling of tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate, which exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation from hot and cold stimuli. Moreover, the integration of wearable infrared detector with a soft robotic gripper for temperature prewarning is demonstrated.








Abstract
Artificial skin, endowed with the capability to perceive thermal stimuli without physical contact, will bring innovative interactive experiences into smart robotics and augmented reality. The implementation of touchless thermosensation, responding to both hot and cold stimuli, relies on the construction of a flexible infrared detector operating in the long&#8208;wavelength infrared range to capture the spontaneous thermal radiation. This imposes rigorous requirements on the photodetection performance and mechanical flexibility of the detector. Herein, a flexible and wearable infrared detector is presented, on basis of the photothermoelectric coupling of the tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and the infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate. By suppressing the optical reflection loss and aligning the destructive interference position with the absorption peak of polyimide, the fabricated thermopile detector exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation over a broad source temperature range from &#8722;50 to 110&#160;&#176;C, even capable of resolving 0.05&#160;&#176;C temperature change. Spatially resolved radiation distribution sensing is also achieved by constructing an integrated thermopile array. Furthermore, an established temperature prewarning system is demonstrated for soft robotic gripper, enabling the identification of noxious thermal stimuli in a contactless manner. A feasible strategy is offered here to integrate the infrared detection technique into the sensory modality of electronic skin.

         <title>Photoactivation Inducing Multifunctional Coupling of Fluorophore for Efficient Tumor Therapy In Situ</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable sensor for in situ formation of near infrared fluorochrome is reported. Importantly, the photoactivation process involves the generation of superoxide anion radicals, which is highly promising for photodynamic therapy. Besides, the photochemically generated product possess ultra&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 90.9%. Importantly, BI and Cy&#9472;BI are identified as efficient CHK1 inhibitor.








Abstract
Photoactivatable molecules, with high&#8208;precision spatialtemporal control, have largely promoted bioimaging and phototherapy applications of fluorescent dyes. Here, the first photoactivatable sensor (BI) is described that can be triggered by broad excitation light (405&#8211;660 nm), which further undergoes intersystem crossing and H&#8208;atom transfer processes to forming superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8722;&#8226;) and carbon radicals. Particularly, the photoinduced gain of carbon&#8208;centered radicals (BI&#8226;) allows for radical&#8208;radical coupling to afford the combined crosslink product (BI&#9472;BI), which would be oxidized in the presence of O2&#8722;&#8226; to produce an extended conjugate system with near infrared emission (820 nm). Besides, the photochemically generated product (Cy&#9472;BI) possesses ultra&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 90.9%, which optimized phototherapy potential. What&#8242;s more, Western Blot assay reveals that both BI and the photoproduct Cy&#9472;BI can efficiently inhibit the expression of CHK1, and the irradiation of BI and Cy&#9472;BI further induces apoptosis and ultimately enhances the phototherapeutic effects. Thus, the combination of cell cycle block inducing apoptosis, photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy treatments significantly suppress solid tumor in vivo antitumor efficacy explorations. This is a novel finding in developing photoactivatable molecules, as well as the broad applicability of photoimaging and phototherapy in tumor&#8208;related areas.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Interfacial Confined Assembly of Colloidal Quantum Dots Quasisuperlattice Microcavities for High&#8208;Resolution Full&#8208;Color Microlaser Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;interfacial confined assembly method is developed for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of quasisuperlattice CQD microstructure arrays by controlling dewetting dynamics. CQD microring arrays exhibit high&#8208;Q laser resonant cavities with low thresholds and tunable laser emission modes. Surface treatment and liquid dynamics control enable on&#8208;chip integration of multicomponent CQD microlaser arrays.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are considered a promising material for the next generation of integrated display devices due to their designable optical bandgap and low energy consumption. Owing to their dispersibility in solvents, CQD micro/nanostructures are generally fabricated by solution&#8208;processing methods. However, the random mass transfer in liquid restricts the programmable construction in macroscopy and ordered assembly in microscopy for the integration of CQD optical structures. Herein, a multi&#8208;interfacial confined assembly strategy is developed to fabricate CQDs programmable microstructure arrays with a quasisuperlattice configuration through controlling the dynamics of three&#8208;phase contact lines (TPCLs). The motion of TPCLs dominates the division of liquid film for precise positioning of CQD microstructures, while pinned TPCLs control the solvent evaporation and concentration gradient to directionally drive the mass transfer and packing of CQDs. Owing to their long&#8208;range order and adjustable structural dimensions, CQD microring arrays function as high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor (high&#8208;Q) lasing resonant cavities with low thresholds and tunable lasing emission modes. Through the further surface treatment and liquid dynamics control, the on&#8208;chip integration of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) multicomponent CQD microlaser arrays are demonstrated. The technique establishes a new route to fabricate large&#8208;area, ultrahigh&#8208;definition, and full&#8208;color CQD laser displays.

         <title>Insight into Multiple Intermolecular Coordination of Composite Solid Electrolytes via Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a simple and effective composite solid electrolyte with multiple coordination to stabilize high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries is discovered, and the interface formation mechanism is visualized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The multiple coordination prevents the continuous decomposition of the polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites and establishing stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through the preferential decomposition of anions, thereby ensuring the long&#8208;term cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

Polymer/ceramic&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSE) are promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SLBs), benefiting from the combined mechanical robustness of polymeric electrolytes and the high ionic conductivity of ceramic electrolytes. However, the interfacial instability and poorly understood interphases of CSE hinder their application in high&#8208;voltage SLBs. Herein, a simple but effective CSE that stabilizes high&#8208;voltage SLBs by forming multiple intermolecular coordination interactions between polyester and ceramic electrolytes is discovered. The multiple coordination between the carbonyl groups in poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and the fluorosulfonyl groups in anions with Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 nanoparticles is directly visualized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation. Importantly, the multiple coordination in CSE not only prevents the continuous decomposition of polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites but also establishes stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through preferential decomposition of anions. The stable CSE and its inorganic&#8208;rich interphases enable Li||Li symmetric cells with an exceptional lifespan of over 4800 h without dendritic shorting at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high&#8208;voltage SLB with LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode displays excellent cycling stability over 1100 cycles at a 1C charge/discharge rate. This work reveals the underlying mechanism behind the excellent stability of coordinating composite electrolytes and interfaces in high&#8208;voltage SLBs.

         <title>Stable and High&#8208;performance Flow H2&#8208;O2 Fuel Cells with Coupled Acidic Oxygen Reduction and Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new, coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by integrating acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction is developed, leading to a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.057&#160;V. More specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode demonstrates a high electricity output and excellent durability, far superior to the conventional fuel cells.








Abstract
Conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells suffer from the low output voltage, insufficient durability, and high&#8208;cost catalysts (e.g., noble metals). Herein, this work reports a conceptually new coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by coupling asymmetric electrolytes for acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction. By introducing an electrochemical neutralization energy, the newly&#8208;developed CF&#8208;FCs possess a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage. Specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode catalyst demonstrates a high electricity output up to 1.81&#160;V and durability with an ultrahigh retention of 91% over 110&#160;h, far superior to the conventional fuel cells (usually, &lt; 1.0&#160;V, &lt; 50% retention over 20&#160;h). The output performance can even be significantly enhanced easily by connecting multiple CF&#8208;FCs into the parallel, series, or combined parallel&#8208;series connections at a fractional cost of that for the conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale practical applications. Thus, this study provides a platform to transform conventional fuel cell technology through the rational design and development of advanced energy conversion and storage devices by coupling different electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Emerging Co&#8208;Assembled and Sustained Released Natural Medicinal Nanoparticles for Multitarget Therapy of Choroidal Neovascularization</title>

         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;assembled lutein/nintedanib nanoparticles (L/N NPs) exhibit markedly improved stability and facilitate prolonged, sustained drug release following minimally invasive subconjunctival administration, so as to successfully mitigate the progression of age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) by harnessing a synergistic combination of anti&#8208;angiogenesis, anti&#8208;oxidative stress, anti&#8208;fibrosis and anti&#8208;inflammation actions.








Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) disease has become a worldwide senile disease, and frequent intravitreal injection of anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) is the mainstream treatment in the clinic, which is associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. Herein, nintedanib, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, and lutein, a potent antioxidant, can co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles through multiple noncovalent interactions. Interestingly, the co&#8208;assembled lutein/nintedanib nanoparticles (L/N NPs) exhibit significantly improved stability and achieve long&#8208;term sustained release of two drugs for at least two months in mice. Interestingly, in rabbit eyeball with a more complete barrier system, the L/N NPs still successfully distribute in the retina and choroid for a month. In the laser&#8208;induced mouse choroidal neovascularization model, the L/N NPs after a minimally invasive subconjunctival administration can successfully inhibit angiogenesis and achieve comparable and even better therapeutic results to that of standard intravitreal injection of anti&#8208;VEGF. Therefore, the subconjunctival injection of L/N NPs with long&#8208;term sustained drug release behavior represents a promising and innovative strategy for AMD treatment. Such minimally invasive administration together with the ability to effectively inhibit angiogenesis reduce inflammation and counteract oxidative stress and holds great potential for improving patient outcomes and quality of life in those suffering from this debilitating eye condition.

         <title>PROTAC Prodrug&#8208;Integrated Nanosensitizer for Potentiating Radiation Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;loaded nanosensitizer, featuring PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) prodrug and HfO2 nanoparticles, is engineered to sensitize radiotherapy in head and neck cancer by amplifying DNA damage and inactivating RAD51&#8208;associated protein 1 through bromodomain protein 4 degradation. 








Abstract
Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the primary options for clinical cancer therapy, in particular advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Herein, the crucial role of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4)&#8208;RAD51 associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) axis in sensitizing RT of HNSCC is revealed. A versatile nanosensitizer (RPB7H) is thus innovatively engineered by integrating a PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) prodrug (BPA771) and hafnium dioxide (HfO2) nanoparticles to downregulate BRD4&#8208;RAD51AP1 pathway and sensitize HNSCC tumor to RT. Upon intravenous administration, the RPB7H nanoparticles selectively accumulate at the tumor tissue and internalize into tumor cells by recognizing neuropilin&#8208;1 overexpressed in the tumor mass. HfO2 nanoparticles enhance RT effectiveness by amplifying X&#8208;ray deposition, intensifying DNA damage, and boosting oxidative stress. Meanwhile, BPA771 can be activated by RT&#8208;induced H2O2 secretion to degrade BRD4 and inactivate RAD51AP1, thus impeding RT&#8208;induced DNA damage repair. This versatile nanosensitizer, combined with X&#8208;ray irradiation, effectively regresses HNSCC tumor growth in a mouse model. The findings introduce a PROTAC prodrug&#8208;based radiosensitization strategy by targeting the BRD4&#8208;RAD51AP1 axis, may offer a promising avenue to augment RT and more effective HNSCC therapy.

To solve the challenges of simultaneously achieving ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness, and high sensitivity for wearable sensing applications, for the first time, this work proposes a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels with stop holes as ultrasoft, high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance, and sensitive conformal HMIs for remote disease diagnosis and smart aquaculture.








Abstract
Hydrogels are considered as promising materials for human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs) owing to their merits of tailorable mechanical and electrical properties; nevertheless, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness and high sensitivity, which are the pre&#8208;requisite requirements for wearable sensing applications. Herein, for the first time, this work proposes a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate ultrasoft gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels (FSHs) with stop holes for high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance and sensitive conformal HMIs.

The FSHs are used for precisely acquiring and identifying gesture commands of the operator to remotely control a surgical robot for endoscopy and an electric ship in a first&#8208;person perspective for cruising, feeding crabs and monitoring the environmental change in real&#8208;time.

         <title>Viscoelasticity&#8208;Controlled Relaxation in Wrinkling Surface for Multistage Time&#8208;Resolved Optical Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; wrinkling system with controllable polymer interaction networks. By regulating the viscoelasticity of polymer interaction networks, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. Consequently, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved, which can be further utilized to develop a practical encryption label.








Abstract
As counterfeit techniques continue to evolve, ensuring the security of conventional &#8220;static&#8221; encryption methods becomes increasingly challenging. Here, the viscoelasticity&#8208;controlled relaxation is introduced for the first time in a bilayer wrinkling system by regulating the density of hydrogen bond networks in polymer to construct a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; encryption material. The wrinkling surface can manipulate light during the dynamic relaxation process, exhibiting three stages with frosted glass, structural color, and mirror reflection. By regulating the viscoelasticity of skin layer through UV irradiation, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. As a result, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved. Crucially, the encryption material is developed as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting label for packing boxes in daily applications, allowing the encrypted information to be activated manually and identified by naked eyes, surpassing the existing time&#8208;resolved encryption materials in utilization potential. Besides, the dynamic hydrogen bond networks are extended to various dynamic interaction networks, demonstrating the versatility of the dynamic encryption strategy. This work not only provides an additional dimension for dynamic information encryption in daily practical use, but also offers theoretical guidance for the development of advanced optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and smart display materials in the future.

         <title>Dynamically Reconstructed Triple&#8208;Copper&#8208;Vacancy Associates Confined in Cu Nanowires Enabling High&#8208;Rate and Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates are first constructed through electroreduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, demonstrated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations disclose the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which favor *CO adsorption and dimerization.








Abstract
Electrochemically reconstructed Cu&#8208;based catalysts always exhibit enhanced CO2&#160;electroreduction performance; however, it still remains ambiguous whether the reconstructed Cu vacancies have a substantial impact on CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ reactivity. Herein, Cu vacancies are first constructed through electrochemical reduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, in which high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image manifests the formation of triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates with different concentrations, confirmed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy discloses the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates favor *CO adsorption and fast *CO dimerization. Moreover, density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations unravel the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which enhances the *CO adsorption and reduces the CO&#8211;CO coupling barrier, affirmed by the decreased *CO dimerization energy barrier by 0.4&#160;eV. As a result, the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates confined in Cu nanowires achieve a high Faradaic efficiency of over 80% for C2+ products in a wide current density range of 400&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Electron Migration Polarization Boosting Electromagnetic Wave Absorption Based on Ce Atoms Modulated yolk@shell FexN@NGC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe4N@NGC/CeSA+Cs+NPs system is constructed to demonstrate the electron migration mechanism, where the Ce single&#8208;atoms (SA) with +3 valence state can feed the electrons to Ce4+ of clusters (Cs) and CeO2 nanoparticles through conductive network under EMW. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe4N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance.








Abstract
The electron migration polarization is considered as a promising approach to optimize electromagnetic waves (EMW) dissipation. However, it is still difficult to realize well&#8208;controlled electron migration and elucidate the related EMW loss mechanisms for current researches. Herein, a novel FexN@NGC/Ce system to construct an effective electron migration model based on the electron leaps among the 4f/5d/6s orbitals of Ce ions is explored. In Fe4N@NGC/CeSA+Cs+NPs, Ce single&#8208;atoms (SA) mainly represent a +3 valence state, which can feed the electrons to Ce4+ of clusters (Cs) and CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) through a conductive network under EMW, leading to the electron migration polarization. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe4N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance with a minimum reflection loss exceeds &#8722;85.1&#160;dB and a broadened absorption bandwidth up to 7.5&#160;GHz at 1.5&#160;mm. This study clarifies the in&#8208;depth relationship between electron migration polarization and EMW dissipation, providing profound insights into developing well&#8208;coordinated magnetic&#8211;dielectric nanocomposites for EMW absorption engineering.

         <title>High&#8208;Safety Electrolytes with an Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structure Tuned by Difluorinated Cations for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel medium concentration electrolyte is designed based on the gem&#8208;difluorinated ionic liquid with ultrahigh safety, high voltage stability, high temperature stability, and excellent Ni&#8208;rich cathode compatibility.








Abstract
As next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must offer high safety, high&#8208;voltage resistance, and a long life span. Electrolyte engineering is a facile strategy to tailor the interfacial chemistry of LMBs. In particular, the solvation structure and derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial for a satisfactory battery performance. Herein, a novel middle&#8208;concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (MCILE) with an anion&#8208;rich solvation structure tuned by difluorinated cations is demonstrated to achieve ultrahigh safety, high&#8208;voltage stability, and excellent ternary&#8208;cathode compatibility. Novel gem&#8208;difluorinated cations first synthesized for prestoring fluorine on positively charged species, not only preferentially adsorb in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz layers, but also participate in regulating the Li+ solvation structure, resulting in a robust interphase. Moreover, these weak interactions in the Li+ solvation structure including anion&#8211;solvent and ionic liquid (IL) cation&#8211;solvent pairs are first revealed, which are beneficial for promoting an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure and the desolvation process. Benefiting from the unique anion&#8208;rich solvation structure, a stable hetero&#8208;SEI structure is obtained. The designed MCILE exhibits compatibility with Li metal anode and the high&#8208;voltage ternary cathode at high temperatures (60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides a new approach for regulating the solvation structure and electrode interphase chemistry of LMBs via difluorinated IL cations.

&lt;p&gt;A novel medium concentration electrolyte is designed based on the gem-difluorinated ionic liquid with ultrahigh safety, high voltage stability, high temperature stability, and excellent Ni-rich cathode compatibility.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As next-generation energy storage devices, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must offer high safety, high-voltage resistance, and a long life span. Electrolyte engineering is a facile strategy to tailor the interfacial chemistry of LMBs. In particular, the solvation structure and derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial for a satisfactory battery performance. Herein, a novel middle-concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (MCILE) with an anion-rich solvation structure tuned by difluorinated cations is demonstrated to achieve ultrahigh safety, high-voltage stability, and excellent ternary-cathode compatibility. Novel gem-difluorinated cations first synthesized for prestoring fluorine on positively charged species, not only preferentially adsorb in the inner-Helmholtz layers, but also participate in regulating the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structure, resulting in a robust interphase. Moreover, these weak interactions in the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structure including anion&#8211;solvent and ionic liquid (IL) cation&#8211;solvent pairs are first revealed, which are beneficial for promoting an anion-dominated solvation structure and the desolvation process. Benefiting from the unique anion-rich solvation structure, a stable hetero-SEI structure is obtained. The designed MCILE exhibits compatibility with Li metal anode and the high-voltage ternary cathode at high temperatures (60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides a new approach for regulating the solvation structure and electrode interphase chemistry of LMBs via difluorinated IL cations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gradient Pores Enhance Charge Storage Density of Carbonaceous Cathodes for Zn&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge density of Zn&#8208;ion capacitor (ZIC)&#160;is significantly enhanced by deploying an activated meso&#8208;microporous shell&#160;carbon (MMSC&#8208;A) nanofibers. The tailored pore size and gradient&#8208;pore structure endow the nanofibers with unusual charge storage mechanism, as elucidated by multiple in situ means.








Abstract
Engineering carbonaceous cathode materials with adequately accessible active sites is crucial for unleashing their charge storage potential. Herein, activated meso&#8208;microporous shell carbon (MMSC&#8208;A)&#160;nanofibers are constructed to enhance the zinc ion storage density by forming a gradient&#8208;pore structure. A dominating pore size of 0.86&#160;nm is tailored to cater for the solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+. Moreover, these gradient porous nanofibers feature rapid ion/electron dual conduction pathways and offer abundant active surfaces with high affinity to electrolyte. When employed in Zn&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs), the electrode delivers significantly enhanced capacity (257 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (200&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 78&#160;W kg&#8722;1), and cyclic stability (95% retention after 10&#160;000 cycles) compared to nonactivated carbon nanofibers electrode. A series of in situ characterization techniques unveil that the improved Zn2+ storage capability stems from size compatibility between the pores and [Zn(H2O)6]2+, the co&#8208;adsorption of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722;, as well as reversible surface chemical interaction. This work presents an effective method to engineering meso&#8208;microporous carbon materials toward high energy&#8208;density storage, and also offers insights into the Zn2+ storage mechanism in such gradient&#8208;pore structures.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvating Ionic Liquid Electrolytes Enabling Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvating ionic liquid electrolyte is developed to enhance the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promote more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li+. This new type of ionic liquid electrolyte improves Li+ transport ability and stabilizes the interface between the electrolyte and high&#8208;nickel cathode, rendering the practical application toward high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are promising to develop high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, ILEs normally face the challenge of sluggish Li+ transport due to increased ions&#8217; clustering caused by Coulombic interactions. Here a type of anion&#8208;reinforced solvating ILEs (ASILEs) is discovered, which reduce ions&#8217; clustering by enhancing the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promoting more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li+ to address this concern. The designed ASILEs, incorporating chlorinated hydrocarbons and two anions, bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI&#8722;) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI&#8722;), aim to enhance Li+ transport ability, stabilize the interface of the high&#8208;nickel cathode material (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811), and retain fire&#8208;retardant properties. With these ASILEs, the Li/NCM811 cell exhibits high initial specific capacity (203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C), outstanding capacity retention (81.6% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C), and excellent average Coulombic efficiency (99.9% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C). Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;level Li/NCM811 pouch cell achieves a notable energy density of 386&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, indicating the practical feasibility of this electrolyte. This research offers a practical solution and fundamental guidance for the rational design of advanced ILEs, enabling the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>A 2D Cryptographic Hash Function Incorporating Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Digital Signatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete hardware&#8208;based and secure user authentication scheme using public key cryptography with integrated circuits constructed using monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors is demonstrated. A key highlight of this study involves exploiting the unique properties of homomorphic encryption where computations are performed on the encrypted data while preserving the integrity of the underlying information.








Abstract
User authentication is a critical aspect of any information exchange system&#160;which verifies the identities of individuals seeking access to sensitive information. Conventionally, this approachrelies on establishing robust digital signature protocols&#160;which employ asymmetric encryption techniques involving a key pair consisting of a public key and its matching private key. In this article, a user verification platform constructed using integrated circuits (ICs) with atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors is presented. First, generation of secure cryptographic keys is demonstrated by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of carrier trapping and detrapping at the 2D/oxide interface trap sites. Subsequently, the ability to manipulate the functionality of logical NOR is leveraged to create a secure one&#8208;way hash function which when homomorphically operated upon with NAND, XOR, OR, NOT, and AND logic circuits generate distinct digital signatures. These signatures when subsequently decrypted, verify the authenticity of the receiver while ensuring complete preservation of data integrity and confidentiality as the underlying information is never revealed. Finally, the advantages of implementing a NOR&#8208;based hashing techniques in comparison to the conventional XOR&#8208;based encryption method are established. This demonstration highlights the potential of 2D&#8208;based ICs in developing critical hardware information security primitives.

         <title>Strain Regulation of Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites Enables High&#8208;Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rb+ fills the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the MA volatilization, relieving shrinkage strain of perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion increases the halide migration barrier, resulting a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite phase, and suppressing nonradiative recombination. As a result, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cell exhibits an improved power conversion efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap mixed&#8208;halogen perovskite materials are widely used as top cells in tandem solar cells. However, serious open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, it is shown that the resulting methylammonium vacancies induce lattice distortion in methylammonium chloride&#8208;assisted perovskite film, resulting in an inhomogeneous halogen distribution and low Voc. Thus, a lattice strain regulation strategy is reported to fabricate high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. Rubidium (Rb) cations are introduced to fill the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the methylammonium volatilization, which alleviates shrinkage strain of the perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion and increased halide ion migration barrier result in a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite film. Due to improved carrier transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap PSC (1.68&#160;eV) achieves an excellent PCE of 21.72%, accompanied by a high Voc of 1.22&#160;V. The resulting device maintains more than 90% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under 1&#8208;sun illumination conditions.

As a result, the Rb-treated wide-bandgap perovskite solar cell exhibits an improved power conversion efficiency and stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wide-bandgap mixed-halogen perovskite materials are widely used as top cells in tandem solar cells. However, serious open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) loss restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, it is shown that the resulting methylammonium vacancies induce lattice distortion in methylammonium chloride-assisted perovskite film, resulting in an inhomogeneous halogen distribution and low &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, a lattice strain regulation strategy is reported to fabricate high-performance wide-bandgap PSCs. Rubidium (Rb) cations are introduced to fill the A-site vacancy caused by the methylammonium volatilization, which alleviates shrinkage strain of the perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion and increased halide ion migration barrier result in a homogeneous mixed-halide perovskite film. Due to improved carrier transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination, the Rb-treated wide-bandgap PSC (1.68&#160;eV) achieves an excellent PCE of 21.72%, accompanied by a high &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.22&#160;V. The resulting device maintains more than 90% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under 1-sun illumination conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Interphase with Energy Dissipation and Fast Li&#8208;Ion Transport for High&#8208;Capacity Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [an]daisy chain (DC)&#8208;based mechanically interlocked network (DCMIN) is used as the artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) for stabilizing the lithium metal anode. The synergistic contractile and large&#8208;amplitude molecular motion of the [an]DC enable the DCMIN not only an effective energy dissipation function but also a fast Li&#8208;ion transport behavior, thus realizing a stable 2800&#160;h of Li&#8208;symmetrical cycling.








Abstract
Constructing an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) on Li metal anodes (LMAs) is a potential strategy for addressing the dendrite issues. However, the mechanical fatigue of the ASEI caused by stress accumulation under the repeated deformation from the Li plating/stripping is not taken seriously. Herein, this work introduces a mechanically interlocked [an]daisy chain network (DCMIN) into the ASEI to stabilize the Li metal/ASEI interface by combining the functions of energy dissipation and fast Li&#8208;ion transport. The DCMIN featured by large&#8208;range molecular motions is cross&#8208;linked via efficient thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry; thus, the DCMIN has flexibility and excellent mechanical properties. As an ASEI, the crown ether units in DCMIN not only interact with the dialkylammonium of a flexible chain, forming the energy dissipation behavior but also coordinate with Li ion to support the fast Li&#8208;ion transport in DCMIN. Therefore, a stable 2800&#160;h&#8208;symmetrical cycling (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and an excellent 5 C&#8208;rate (full cell with LiFePO4) performance are achieved by DCMIN&#8208;based ASEI. Furthermore, the 1&#8208;Ah pouch cell (LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2 cathode) with DCMIN&#8208;coated LMA exhibits improved capacity retention (88%) relative to the Control. The molecular design of DCMIN provides new insights into the optimization of an ASEI for high&#8208;energy LMAs.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Induced Amorphization of Cobalt&#8208;Based Catalyst for Boosted CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;deficient Se&#8208;doped cobalt hydroxide with optimized band structure and catalytic energetics is&#160;theoretically proposed and successfully prepared in an amorphous state. The Se,O co&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;based amorphous nanosheets are capable of photocatalyzing CO2 to CO with satisfactory activity and selectivity, superior to other Co&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to energy carriers is intriguing in the industry but kinetically hard to fulfil due to the lack of rationally designed catalysts. A promising way to improve the efficiency and selectivity of such reduction is to break the structural symmetry of catalysts by manipulating coordination. Here, inspired by analogous CoO6 and CoSe6 octahedral structural motifs of the Co(OH)2 and CoSe, a hetero&#8208;anionic coordination strategy is proposed to construct a symmetry&#8208;breaking photocatalyst prototype of oxygen&#8208;deficient Se&#8208;doped cobalt hydroxide upon first&#8208;principles calculations. Such involvement of large&#8208;size Se atoms in CoO6 octahedral frameworks experimentally lead to the switching of semiconductor type of cobalt hydroxide from p to n, generation of oxygen defects, and amorphization. The resultant oxygen&#8208;deficient Se,O&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;based amorphous nanosheets exhibit impressive photocatalytic performance of CO2 to CO with a generation rate of 60.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the absence of photosensitizer and scavenger, superior to most of the Co&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work establishes a correlation between the symmetry&#8208;breaking of catalytic sites and CO2 photoreduction performances, opening up a new paradigm in the design of amorphous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Printable Block Molecular Assemblies with Controlled Exciton Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of molecular heterostructure is successfully fabricated, with precise control over exciton dynamics in each block (including singlet and triplet excitons featuring ns, &#181;s, and ms emission lifetimes). Moreover, these heterostructures are printable and can be accurately positioned using a Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, leading to programable patterns.








Abstract
Creating hierarchical molecular block heterostructures, with the control over size, shape, optical, and electronic properties of each nanostructured building block can help develop functional applications, such as information storage, nanowire spectrometry, and photonic computing. However, achieving precise control over the position of molecular assemblies, and the dynamics of excitons in each block, remains a challenge. In the present work, the first fabrication of molecular heterostructures with the control of exciton dynamics in each block, is demonstrated. Additionally, these heterostructures are printable and can be precisely positioned using Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, resulting in programable patterns. Singlet excitons with emission lifetimes on nanosecond or microsecond timescales and triplet excitons with emission lifetimes on millisecond timescales appear simultaneously in different building blocks, with an efficient energy transfer process in the heterojunction. These organic materials also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive emission by changing the power or wavelength of the excitation laser. Potential applications of these organic heterostructures in integrated photonics, where the versatility of fluorescence, phosphorescence, efficient energy transfer, printability, and stimulus sensitivity co&#8208;exist in a single nanowire, are foreseen.

         <title>Customized Enhancement of Thermal Sensitivity of Tumors at Different Subcutaneous Depths by Multichannel Lanthanide Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated hydrophilic multichannel lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobe, the depth of a tumor can be evaluated through fluorescence imaging. The probe enables tunable release of a heat shock protein inhibitor to enhance thermal sensitivity of tumors for customized photothermal therapy. An optimized nonuniform light field enables efficient ablation of tumors at different subcutaneous depths while minimizing injury to surrounding tissues.








Abstract
The photothermal therapeutic effect on tumors located at different subcutaneous depths varies due to the attenuation of light by tissue. Here, based on the wavelength&#8208;dependent optical attenuation properties of tissues, the tumor depth is assessed using a multichannel lanthanide nanocomposite. A zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;coated nanocomposite is able to deliver high amounts of the hydrophilic heat shock protein 90 inhibitor epigallocatechin gallate through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding network formed by the encapsulated highly polarized polyoxometalate guest. It is superior to both bare and PEGylated ZIF&#8208;8 for drug delivery. With the assessment of tumor depth and accumulated amount of nanocomposite by fluorescence, an irradiation prescription can be customized to release sufficient HSP90 inhibitor and generate heat for sensitized photothermal treatment of tumors, which not only ensured therapeutic efficacy but also minimized damage to the surrounding tissues.

         <title>Corrosion Engineering of Part&#8208;Per&#8208;Million Single Atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 Electrocatalyst for PET Upcycling at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst with part&#8208;per&#8208;million noble Pt loading is designed for the highly efficient and selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into valuable chemicals (potassium diformate and terephthalic acid) and green hydrogen. This process allows the valuable chemicals production at the ampere&#8208;level current density with high efficiency and is highly profitable (588&#8211;700&#160;$&#160;ton&#8722;1 PET).








Abstract
The plastic waste issue has posed a series of formidable challenges for the ecological environment and human health. While conventional recycling strategies often lead to plastic down&#8208;cycling, the electrochemical strategy of recovering valuable monomers enables an ideal, circular plastic economy. Here a corrosion synthesized single atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst with part&#8208;per&#8208;million noble Pt loading for highly efficient and selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into valuable chemicals (potassium diformate and terephthalic acid) and green hydrogen is reported. Electro&#8208;oxidation of PET hydrolysate, ethylene glycol (EG), to formate is processed with high Faraday efficiency (FE) and selectivity (&gt;90%) at the current density close to 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (1.444&#160;V vs RHE). The in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the mechanism and the understanding of the high efficiency. Remarkably, the electro&#8208;oxidation of EG at the ampere&#8208;level current density is also successfully illustrated by using a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly with high FEs to formate integrated with hydrogen production for 500&#160;h of continuous operation. This process allows valuable chemical production at high space&#8208;time yield and is highly profitable (588&#8211;700&#160;$&#160;ton&#8722;1 PET), showing an industrial perspective on single&#8208;atom catalysis of electrochemical plastic upcycling.

         <title>Reversible Mechanical Contraception and Endometriosis Treatment Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stimuli&#8208;degradable hydrogel implant for reversible fallopian tube occlusion, offering an alternative to permanent sterilization and endometriosis treatment, is introduced. These hydrogel implants mechanically block the tubes with high effectiveness and are removable within 30 min using UV light or a glutathione solution. Demonstrating in ex vivo and in vivo models, this multifunctional system provides a potential method for on&#8208;demand contraception and a mechanical approach to prevent and treat abdominal endometriosis.








Abstract
Female sterilization via fallopian tube ligation is a common procedure; However, after the operation, over 10% of women seek re&#8208;fertilization, which is frequently unsuccessful. In addition, there is evidence that fallopian tubes contribute to the spread of endometriotic tissue as they serve as channels for proinflammatory media entering the abdominal cavity via retrograde menstruation. Here, stimuli&#8208;degradable hydrogel implants are presented for the functional, biocompatible, and reversible occlusion of fallopian tubes. The hydrogel implants, designed with customized swelling properties, mechanically occlude fallopian tubes in a high&#8208;performance manner with burst pressures reaching 255&#8211;558&#160;mmHg, exceeding normal abdominal pressures (95&#160;mmHg). Their damage&#8208;free removal can be achieved within 30 min using near&#8208;visible UV light or a glutathione solution, employing a method akin to standard fallopian tube perfusion diagnostics. Ultrasound&#8208;guided implant placement is demonstrated using a clinical hysteroscope in a human&#8208;scale uterus model and biocompatibility in a porcine in vivo model. Importantly, the prevention of live sperm as well as endometrial cell passage through blocked fallopian tubes is demonstrated. Overall, a multifunctional system is presented that constitutes a possible means of on&#8208;demand, reversible contraception along with the first&#8208;ever mechanical approach to abdominal endometriosis prevention and treatment.

         <title>Secondary Amines Functionalized Organocatalytic Iodine Redox for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalytic mechanism of secondary amine functionalized phenylamine&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymer (PA&#8208;CMP) cathode on iodine redox through H&#183;&#183;&#183;I bridging is systematically investigated. The I&#8722; anion based aqueous dual&#8208;ion battery demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance with ultrahigh capacity of 730/516 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1/15 A g&#8722;1, ultralow overpotential of 47/129 mV at 1/15 A g&#8722;1, and stable long&#8208;term performance for over 5000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs) based on the cooperative redox of cations and iodine anions at the anode and cathode respectively, are attracting increasing interest because of high capacity and safety. However, the full&#8208;cell performance is limited by the sluggish iodine redox kinetics between iodide and polyiodide involving multiple electron transfer steps, and the undesirable shuttling effect of polyiodides. Here, this work reports a versatile conjugated microporous polymer functionalized with secondary amine groups as an organocatalytic cathode for ADIB, which can be positively charged and electrostatically adsorb iodide, and organocatalyze iodine redox reactions through the amine groups. Both theoretical calculations and controlled experiments confirm that the secondary amine groups confine (poly)iodide species via hydrogen bonding, which is essential for accelerating iodine redox kinetics and reducing the polyiodide shuttling effect. The ADIB achieves an ultrahigh capacity of 730 mAh g&#8722;1 with an ultrasmall overpotential of 47&#160;mV at 1 A g&#8722;1, which also exhibits excellent rate performance and long cycling stability with a capacity retention of 74% after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5&#8201;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the promise of developing organocatalysts for accelerating electrochemical processes, which remains a virtually unexplored area in electrocatalyst design for clean energy applications.

         <title>RhNi Bimetallenes with Lattice&#8208;Compressed Rh Skin towards Ultrastable Acidic Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
RhNi bimetallenes with a Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability for over 400 h towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction, which also reveals an excellent catalytic performance, including a high NH3 yield (13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1) and a commendable NH3 Faradaic efficiency (98.4%).








Abstract
Harvesting recyclable ammonia (NH3) from acidic nitrate (NO3&#8722;)&#8208;containing wastewater requires the utilization of corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalytic materials with high activity and selectivity towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3ER). Herein, ultrathin RhNi bimetallenes with Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) are fabricated towards acidic NO3ER. The Rh&#8208;skin atoms on the surface of RhNi@Rh BMLs experience the lattice compression&#8208;induced strain effect, resulting in shortened Rh&#8211;Rh bond and downshifted d&#8208;band center. Experimental and theoretical calculation results corroborate that Rh&#8208;skin atoms can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability of RhNi@Rh BMLs (over 400 h) towards acidic NO3ER. RhNi@Rh BMLs also reveal an excellent catalytic performance, boasting a 98.4% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and a 13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 NH3 yield. Theoretical calculations reveal that compressive stress tunes the electronic structure of Rh skin atoms, which facilitates the reduction of NO* to NOH* in NO3ER. The practicality of RhNi@Rh BMLs has also been confirmed in an alkaline&#8208;acidic hybrid zinc&#8208;nitrate battery with a 1.39&#160;V open circuit voltage and a 10.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 power density. This work offers valuable insights into the nature of electrocatalyst deactivation behavior and guides the development of high&#8208;efficiency corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for applications in energy and environment.

Theoretical calculations reveal that compressive stress tunes the electronic structure of Rh skin atoms, which facilitates the reduction of NO* to NOH* in NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ER. The practicality of RhNi@Rh BMLs has also been confirmed in an alkaline-acidic hybrid zinc-nitrate battery with a 1.39&#160;V open circuit voltage and a 10.5&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; power density. This work offers valuable insights into the nature of electrocatalyst deactivation behavior and guides the development of high-efficiency corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts for applications in energy and environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis of Intrinsic High&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric 2D CuCrSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a chemical vapor deposition method is reported to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 single crystal. The ultrathin CuCrSe2 nanosheet exhibits a high Curie temperature TC of 800 K. The in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in 2D CuCrSe2 are characterized by piezo&#8208;response force microscopy measurements and confirmed by the lateral and vertical devices.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature are critical for multifunctional ferroelectric devices. However, the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization is consistently broken by the strong thermal fluctuations at high temperature, resulting in the rare discovery of high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity in 2D materials. Here, a chemical vapor deposition method is reported to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 nanosheets. The crystal structure is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization. The measured ferroelectric phase transition temperature of ultrathin CuCrSe2 is about &#8776;800 K. Significantly, the switchable ferroelectric polarization is observed in &#8776;5.2&#160;nm nanosheet. Moreover, the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric response are modulated by different maximum bias voltage. This work provides a new insight into the construction of 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature.

         <title>Homeostatic Solid Solution Reaction in Phosphate Cathode: Breaking High&#8208;Voltage Barrier to Achieve High Energy Density and Long Life of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homeostatic solid solution characteristics drive the phosphate with multilevel redox (MLNP) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), breaking through the high barrier of intrinsic mono&#8208;redox center with sluggish reactivity&#160;by differentiating each redox couple. This establishes fast and stable reaction kinetics, balancing multi&#8208;electron transfer and low strain to develope high energy&#8208;density and durable NASICON cathodes for SIBs.








Abstract
The stable phase transformation during electrochemical progress drives extensive research on vanadium&#8208;based polyanions in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), especially Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard&#8208;to&#8208;access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron&#8208;transfer process (&#8776;2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance cathodes in SIBs.

         <title>Simple&#8208;Structured Acceptor with Highly Interconnected Electron&#8208;Transport Pathway Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport plays a significant role in determining the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a highly interconnected electron&#8208;transport pathway in simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) is achieved by manipulating the alkyl&#8208;chain topology. Therefore, the 3TTB&#8208;4F with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains demonstrates a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certified 16.59%), establishing it as the highest efficiency among NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
Achieving desirable charge&#8208;transport highway is of vital importance for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, it is shown how molecular packing arrangements can be regulated via tuning the alkyl&#8208;chain topology, thus resulting in a 3D network stacking and highly interconnected pathway for electron transport in a simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains. As a result, a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certificated 16.59%) is achieved for NFREA&#8208;based devices, thus providing an opportunity for constructing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

Hardware Security
In article number 2400661, Akshay Wali, Harikrishnan Ravichandran, and Saptarshi Das present a novel hardware security authentication system that employs programmable integrated circuits (ICs) crafted from atomically thin monolayers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a two&#8208;dimensional material. It capitalizes on the inherent randomness of charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping in 2D memtransistors to generate cryptographic keys. Additionally, it utilizes the properties of a NOR gate to establish a secure one&#8208;way hash function.

Immunotherapy
The image demonstrates the ionic liquid embolic exiting the tip of a catheter and filling the arteries of the tumor. The purple color depicts the ablation of the vessel wall and the adjacent tumor tissue as the ionic liquid diffuses across the vessel wall. As the ionic liquid diffuses trans&#8208;arterially, it carries its payload, which in this case is Nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug. Along the margins of the tumor ablation, Nivolumab is seen interacting with cells enabling immunotherapy to occur. More details can be found in article number 2309412 by Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers.

Radiotherapy Adjuvant
In article number 2311291, Yuliang Zhao, Zhihua Liu, Chunying Chen, and co&#8208;workers report that a novel lipid&#8208;modified manganese diselenide nanoparticle (MnSe2&#8208;lipid) with extraordinarily uniform sphere morphology and tumor microenvironment responsiveness is developed. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosensitivity by generating reactive oxygen species induced by Fenton&#8208;like reaction and activating cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Spontaneously, selenium strengthens immune response and performs antioxidant activity to reduce side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy.

Van Der Waals Colloidal Crystals
In article number 2312748, Seungwoo Lee and co&#8208;workers report a method for the unexplored van der Waals force&#8208;driven colloidal crystallization. This study demonstrates how to modulate their inter&#8208;particle interaction, enabling the colloidal crystallization with liquid gap. The diffractive colors of the colloidal crystals have been visualized through optical microscopy, correlate with their SEM image.

3D Printing of Double Network Granular Elastomers
The frontispiece showcases a granular ink composed of elastomeric microparticles that is 3D printed through direct ink writing (DIW) into the iconic Matterhorn, the Swiss mountain landmark. In article number 2313189, Eva Baur, Benjamin Tiberghien, and Esther Amstad solidify the granular structure without compromising the shape fidelity of the printed object by forming a 2nd percolating elastomer network across the microparticles to result in double network granular elastomers (DNGEs).

         <title>In Vivo Stimulation of Therapeutic Antigen&#8208;Specific T Cells in an Artificial Lymph Node Matrix (Adv. Mater. 23/2024)</title>

Artificial Lymph Node
In article number 2310043, Hai&#8208;Quan Mao, Jonathan P. Schneck, and co&#8208;workers report an artificial lymph node (aLN) biomatrix composed of a hydrogel conjugated with T cell stimulating signals. Following subcutaneous injection, this aLN biomatrix develops into a complex immune niche in vivo. Na&#239;ve, adoptively transferred T cells are stimulated within the aLN in an antigen&#8208;specific manner through direct interaction with the matrix. The cover art depicts a novel aLN hydrogel biomatrix which when injected subcutaneously, is capable of simulating adoptively transferred na&#239;ve T cells and recruiting an array of endogenous immune cells. Upon entering the porous biomatrix, na&#239;ve T cells (green) bind to the antigen&#8208;specific stimulating signals conjugated to the hydrogel matrix and are activated (yellow) and interact with the recruited cells in the dynamic immune microenvironment, which facilitate the expansion and differentiation into effector and memory T&#8208;cells (orange). The activated T cells then emigrate and travel to the tumor where they can directly kill the tumor cells and lead to increased survival of animals with established tumors.

         <title>Structuring and Shaping of Mechanically Robust and Functional Hydrogels toward Wearable and Implantable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remarkable similarities to living tissues make hydrogels especially suitable for biointegrated applications that closely interact with human bodies. Recent progress in polymer science and advanced processing technologies that enable the mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels are reviewed. Moreover, perspectives on further development of mechanically reliable, adaptive biointegrated hydrogel devices for practical use are discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogels possess unique features such as softness, wetness, responsiveness, and biocompatibility, making them highly suitable for biointegrated applications that have close interactions with living organisms. However, conventional man&#8208;made hydrogels are usually soft and brittle, making them inferior to the mechanically robust biological hydrogels. To ensure reliable and durable operation of biointegrated wearable and implantable devices, mechanical matching and shape adaptivity of hydrogels to tissues and organs are essential. Recent advances in polymer science and processing technologies have enabled mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels for various biointegrated applications. In this review, polymer network structuring strategies at micro/nanoscales for toughening hydrogels are summarized, and representative mechanical functionalities that exist in biological materials but are not easily achieved in synthetic hydrogels are further discussed. Three categories of processing technologies, namely, 3D printing, spinning, and coating for fabrication of tough hydrogel constructs with complex shapes are reviewed, and the corresponding hydrogel toughening strategies are also highlighted. These developments enable adaptive fabrication of mechanically robust and functional hydrogel devices, and promote application of hydrogels in the fields of biomedical engineering, bioelectronics, and soft robotics.

         <title>Roadmap for Clinical Translation of Mobile Microrobotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical use of medical microrobots gets closer to reality with the rapidly growing biomedical research on them. However, the clinical translation of microrobots has several challenges and obstacles, including scalability, biocompatibility, and imaging. In this review article, a realistic roadmap for medical microrobots is conceptualized with the collaborative efforts of microrobot researchers and&#160;clinicians.








Abstract
Medical microrobotics is an emerging field to revolutionize clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics of various diseases. On the other hand, the mobile microrobotics field has important obstacles to pass before clinical translation. This article focuses on these challenges and provides a roadmap of medical microrobots to enable their clinical use. From the concept of a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; to the physicochemical interactions of microrobots in complex biological environments in medical applications, there are several translational steps to consider. Clinical translation of mobile microrobots is only possible with a close collaboration between clinical experts and microrobotics researchers to address the technical challenges in microfabrication, safety, and imaging. The clinical application potential can be materialized by designing microrobots that can solve the current main challenges, such as actuation limitations, material stability, and imaging constraints. The strengths and weaknesses of the current progress in the microrobotics field are discussed and a roadmap for their clinical applications in the near future is&#160;outlined.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical microrobotics is an emerging field to revolutionize clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics of various diseases. On the other hand, the mobile microrobotics field has important obstacles to pass before clinical translation. This article focuses on these challenges and provides a roadmap of medical microrobots to enable their clinical use. From the concept of a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; to the physicochemical interactions of microrobots in complex biological environments in medical applications, there are several translational steps to consider. Clinical translation of mobile microrobots is only possible with a close collaboration between clinical experts and microrobotics researchers to address the technical challenges in microfabrication, safety, and imaging. The clinical application potential can be materialized by designing microrobots that can solve the current main challenges, such as actuation limitations, material stability, and imaging constraints. The strengths and weaknesses of the current progress in the microrobotics field are discussed and a roadmap for their clinical applications in the near future is&#160;outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development and Application of an Advanced Biomedical Material&#8208;Silk Sericin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk sericin, as an advanced biomedical material, exhibits well cytocompatibility, low immunogenicity, cell function&#8208;regulating activities, etc. This review summarizes the latest fundamental advances and biomedical applications of this natural sericin bioactive material and discusses unsolved issues, potential applications, and future research directions.








Abstract
Sericin, a protein derived from silkworm cocoons, is considered a waste product derived from the silk industry for thousands of years due to a lack of understanding of its properties. However, in recent decades, a range of exciting properties of sericin are studied and uncovered, including cytocompatibility, low&#8208;immunogenicity, photo&#8208;luminescence, antioxidant properties, as well as cell&#8208;function regulating activities. These properties make sericin&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for biomedical applications. This review summarizes the properties and bioactivities of silk sericin and highlights the latest developments in sericin in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the extended application of sericin in developing flexible electronic devices and 3D bioprinting is also discussed. It is believed that sericin&#8208;based biomaterials have great potential of being developed into novel tissue engineering products and smart implantable devices for various medical applications toward improving clinical outcomes.

         <title>Recent Progress in Implantable Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details the recent progress of implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs) with spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled drug release capabilities. The stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms, including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, electricity, magnetism, etc.) are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of various IDDSs, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are discussed.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous effort is devoted to developing platforms, such as implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs), with temporally and spatially controlled drug release capabilities and improved adherence. IDDSs have multiple advantages: i) the timing and location of drug delivery can be controlled by patients using specific stimuli (light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.). Some intelligent &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS can even realize self&#8208;management without human participation. ii) IDDSs enable continuous and stable delivery of drugs over a long period (months to years) and iii) to administer drugs directly to the lesion, thereby helping reduce dosage and side effects. iv) IDDSs enable personalized drug delivery according to patient needs. The high demand for such systems has prompted scientists to make efforts to develop intelligent IDDS. In this review, several common stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, proteins, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.), are given in detail. Besides, several types of IDDS reported in recent years are reviewed, including various stimulus&#8208;responsive systems based on the above mechanisms, radio frequency&#8208;controlled IDDS, &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS, self&#8208;powered IDDS, etc. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of various IDDS, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are analyzed to provide directions for subsequent research.

         <title>From Nature&#8208;Sourced Polysaccharide Particles to Advanced Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosourced polysaccharide particles have promising applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, bioengineering, food industry, and several other fields. This review highlights progresses in advanced materials derived from polysaccharide particles, along as the description of their extraction, fabrication, and modification.








Abstract
Polysaccharides constitute over 90% of the carbohydrate mass in nature, which makes them a promising feedstock for manufacturing sustainable materials. Polysaccharide particles (PSPs) are used as effective scavengers, carriers of chemical and biological cargos, and building blocks for the fabrication of macroscopic materials. The biocompatibility and degradability of PSPs are advantageous for their uses as biomaterials with more environmental friendliness. This review highlights the progresses in PSP applications as advanced functional materials, by describing PSP extraction, preparation, and surface functionalization with a variety of functional groups, polymers, nanoparticles, and biologically active species. This review also outlines the fabrication of PSP&#8208;derived macroscopic materials, as well as their applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, and bioengineering. The paper is concluded with an outlook providing perspectives in the development and applications of PSP&#8208;derived materials.

         <title>Interfacial Solar Evaporation: From Fundamental Research to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article comprehensively reviews the development of interfacial solar evaporation technologies, covering the design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance photothermal materials and solar evaporators, the energy nexus of 2D and 3D evaporation systems, and the corresponding energy management strategies, and the explored applications to solve practical issues. The summarized knowledge offers a perspective for future study and development of the field.








Abstract
In the last decade, interfacial solar steam generation (ISSG), powered by natural sunlight garnered significant attention due to its great potential for low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly clean water production in alignment with the global decarbonization efforts. This review aims to share the knowledge and engage with a broader readership about the current progress of ISSG technology and the facing challenges to promote further advancements toward practical applications. The first part of this review assesses the current strategies for enhancing the energy efficiency of ISSG systems, including optimizing light absorption, reducing energy losses, harvesting additional energy, and lowering evaporation enthalpy. Subsequently, the current challenges faced by ISSG technologies, notably salt accumulation and bio&#8208;fouling issues in practical applications, are elucidated and contemporary methods are discussed to overcome these challenges. In the end, potential applications of ISSG, ranging from initial seawater desalination and industrial wastewater purification to power generation, sterilization, soil remediation, and innovative concept of solar sea farm, are introduced, highlighting the promising potential of ISSG technology in contributing to sustainable and environmentally conscious practices. Based on the review and in&#8208;depth understanding of these aspects, the future research focuses are proposed to address potential issues in both fundamental research and practical applications.

         <title>Degradation Mechanisms of Electrodes Promotes Direct Regeneration of Spent Li&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has attracted considerable attention compared to traditional recycling methods. Only by having an adequate understanding of degradation mechanisms and defective types of failed materials can be found more suitable and efficient methods for direct repairing spent LIBs. A comprehensive overview of degradation mechanisms and regeneration methods for spent LIBs is provided.








Abstract
The rapid growth of electric vehicle use is expected to cause a significant environmental problem in the next few years due to the large number of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Recycling spent LIBs will not only alleviate the environmental problems but also address the challenge of limited natural resources shortages. While several hydro&#8208; and pyrometallurgical processes are developed for recycling different components of spent batteries, direct regeneration presents clear environmental, and economic advantages. The principle of the direct regeneration approach is restoring the electrochemical performance by healing the defective structure of the spent materials. Thus, the development of direct regeneration technology largely depends on the formation mechanism of defects in spent LIBs. This review systematically details the degradation mechanisms and types of defects found in diverse cathode materials, graphite anodes, and current collectors during the battery's lifecycle. Building on this understanding, principles and methodologies for directly rejuvenating materials within spent LIBs are outlined. Also the main challenges and solutions for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of spent LIBs are proposed. Furthermore, this review aims to pave the way for the direct regeneration of materials in discarded lithium&#8208;ion batteries by offering a theoretical foundation and practical guidance.

This review systematically details the degradation mechanisms and types of defects found in diverse cathode materials, graphite anodes, and current collectors during the battery's lifecycle. Building on this understanding, principles and methodologies for directly rejuvenating materials within spent LIBs are outlined. Also the main challenges and solutions for the large-scale direct regeneration of spent LIBs are proposed. Furthermore, this review aims to pave the way for the direct regeneration of materials in discarded lithium-ion batteries by offering a theoretical foundation and practical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Film&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Assembly Toward Bioinspired Bulk Structural Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites have received extensive attention owing to the requirements of structural applications. In this review, the bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy is highlighted as a simple, flexible, and scalable path toward fabricating bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites on demand. Specifically, its design principles, comprehensive advantages, flexible extensions, along with recent advances in bioinspired structural materials are discussed, respectively.








Abstract
Biological materials, although composed of meager minerals and biopolymers, often exhibit amazing mechanical properties far beyond their components due to hierarchically ordered structures. Understanding their structure&#8211;properties relationships and replicating them into artificial materials would boost the development of bulk structural nanocomposites. Layered microstructure widely exists in biological materials, serving as the fundamental structure in nanosheet&#8208;based nacres and nanofiber&#8208;based Bouligand tissues, and implying superior mechanical properties. High&#8208;efficient and scalable fabrication of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites with precise layered microstructure is therefore important yet remains difficult. Here, one straightforward bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy is focused for fabricating bioinspired layered bulk structural nanocomposites. The bottom&#8208;up assembly strategy inherently offers a methodology for precise construction of bioinspired layered microstructure in bulk form, availability for fabrication of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites with large sizes and complex shapes, possibility for design of multiscale interfaces, feasibility for manipulation of diverse heterogeneities. Not limited to discussing what has been achieved by using the current bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy, it is also envisioned how to promote such an assembly strategy to better benefit the development of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites. Compared to other assembly strategies, the highlighted strategy provides great opportunities for creating bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites on demand.

         <title>Engineering Quantum Light Sources with Flat Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores latest development of leveraging flat&#8208;optics to generate ultra&#8208;compact quantum light sources with improved efficiency and added functionalities. It highlights photon&#8208;pair sources with nonlinear metasurfaces and single&#8208;photon emitters in 3D and 2D materials integrated with metasurfaces. The review also discusses current challenges and provide insights into the potential future directions for advancing flat&#8208;optics quantum light&#160;sources.








Abstract
Quantum light sources are essential building blocks for many quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, powerful computing, and precise sensing and imaging. Recent advancements have witnessed a significant shift toward the utilization of &#8220;flat&#8221; optics with thickness at subwavelength scales for the development of quantum light sources. This approach offers notable advantages over conventional bulky counterparts, including compactness, scalability, and improved efficiency, along with added functionalities. This review focuses on the recent advances in leveraging flat optics to generate quantum light sources. Specifically, the generation of entangled photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down&#8208;conversion in nonlinear metasurfaces, and single photon emission from quantum emitters including quantum dots and color centers in 3D and 2D materials are explored. The review covers theoretical principles, fabrication techniques, and properties of these sources, with particular emphasis on the enhanced generation and engineering of quantum light sources using optical resonances supported by nanostructures. The diverse application range of these sources is discussed and the current challenges and perspectives in the field are&#160;highlighted.

         <title>Locally Strained 2D Materials: Preparation, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials hold great promise in strain engineering. By introducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, localized and non&#8208;uniform strain can be induced, leading to novel phenomena and unique properties. This review systematically outlines the recent progress in the preparation, properties, and applications of locally strained 2D materials, aiming to broaden the scope of the 2D family for diverse applications.








Abstract
2D materials are promising for strain engineering due to their atomic thickness and exceptional mechanical properties. In particular, non&#8208;uniform and localized strain can be induced in 2D materials by generating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, resulting in novel phenomena and properties, as witnessed in recent years. Therefore, the locally strained 2D materials are of great value for both fundamental studies and practical applications. This review discusses techniques for introducing local strains to 2D materials, and their feasibility, advantages, and challenges. Then, the unique effects and properties that arise from local strain are explored. The representative applications based on locally strained 2D materials are illustrated, including memristor, single photon emitter, and photodetector. Finally, concluding remarks on the challenges and opportunities in the emerging field of locally strained 2D materials are provided.

         <title>Unexpected Energy Applications of Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids and their various analogues are without doubt the scientific sensation of recent decades, paving the yellow brick road to a worldly version of Oz's green &#8220;Emerald city&#8221;&#8212;a more sustainable society. Their versatile properties, originating from an almost inconceivably large number of possible cation and anion combinations, allows tuning of structures to serve a desired purpose.








Abstract
Ionic liquids and their various analogues are without doubt the scientific sensation of the last few decades, paving the way to a more sustainable society. Their versatile suite of properties, originating from an almost inconceivably large number of possible cation and anion combinations, allows tuning of the structure to serve a desired purpose. Ionic liquids hence offer a myriad of useful applications from solvents to catalysts, through to lubricants, gas absorbers, and azeotrope breakers. The purpose of this review is to explore the more unexpected of these applications, particularly in the energy space. It guides the reader through the application of ionic liquids and their analogues as i) phase change materials for thermal energy storage, ii) organic ionic plastic crystals, which have been studied as battery electrolytes and in gas separation, iii) key components in the nitrogen reduction reaction for sustainable ammonia generation, iv) as electrolytes in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries, and v) in other emerging technologies. It is concluded that there is tremendous scope for further optimizing and tuning of the ionic liquid in its task, subject to sustainability imperatives in line with current global priorities, assisted by artificial intelligence.
