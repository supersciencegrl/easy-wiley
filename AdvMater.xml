         <title>Hydrated Eutectic Electrolyte Induced Bilayer Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries with 100&#160;&#176;C Wide&#8208;Temperature Range</title>

         <dc:description>
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is hindered by challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in harsh environments. A new&#8208;type hydrated eutectic electrolyte is developed to in situ form a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase, thereby improving the reversibility of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) encounters challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in battery performance under harsh environments. Here, a novel hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn(ClO4)2&#183;6H2O, ethylene glycol (EG), and InCl3 solution is introduced to effectively extend the lifespan of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the H2O molecules are confined within the liquid eutectic network through dual&#8208;interaction, involving coordination with Zn2+ and hydrogen bonding with EG, thus weakening the activity of free water and extending the electrochemical window. Importantly, cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques reveal that HEE in situ forms a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase by the dissociation&#8208;reduction of eutectic molecules. Specifically, the zincophilic interphase reduces the energy barrier for Zn nucleation, promoting uniform Zn deposition, while the zincophobic interphase prevents active water from contacting the Zn surface, thus inhibiting the side reactions. Furthermore, the relationships between the structural evolution of the liquid eutectic network and interfacial chemistry at electrode/electrolyte interphase are further discussed in this work. The scalability of this design strategy can bring benefits to AZIBs operating over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Subcutaneous Administration of a Zwitterionic Chitosan&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Controlled Spatiotemporal Release of Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel is developed using chitosan and chitosan@DOTAGA, enabling the repurposing of sterile monoclonal antibodies formulations designed for intravenous administration as tunable subcutaneous (SC) formulations. This hydrogel has demonstrated biodegradability, biocompatibility, and controlled release properties in mice and nonhuman primates, offering rapid translation to human use and potential for clinical development of SC biosimilars.








Abstract
Subcutaneous (SC) administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving therapeutic outcomes and patient compliance. The current FDA&#8208;/EMA&#8208;approved enzymatic approach, utilizing recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) to enhance mAbs SC delivery, involves degrading the extracellular matrix's hyaluronate to increase tissue permeability. However, this method lacks tunable release properties, requiring individual optimization for each mAb. Seeking alternatives, physical polysaccharide hydrogels emerge as promising candidates due to their tunable physicochemical and biodegradability features. Unfortunately, none have demonstrated simultaneous biocompatibility, biodegradability, and controlled release properties for large proteins (&#8805;150&#160;kDa) after SC delivery in clinical settings. Here, a novel two&#8208;component hydrogel comprising chitosan and chitosan@DOTAGA is introduced that can be seamlessly mixed with sterile mAbs formulations initially designed for intravenous (IV) administration, repurposing them as novel tunable SC formulations. Validated in mice and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with various mAbs, including trastuzumab and rituximab, the hydrogel exhibited biodegradability and biocompatibility features. Pharmacokinetic studies in both species demonstrated tunable controlled release, surpassing the capabilities of rHuPH20, with comparable parameters to the rHuPH20+mAbs formulation. These findings signify the potential for rapid translation to human applications, opening avenues for the clinical development of this novel SC biosimilar formulation.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage in Tungsten Bronze Dielectric Ceramics Through a Weakly Coupled Relaxor Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining high energy storage performance in tetragonal tungsten bronze dielectric ceramics is challenging, owing to the complexity of composition design and crystal structure. This study focuses on enhancing the recoverable energy density in Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8722;1.5xSmxNb2O6 by creating weakly coupled polar nanoregions. The resulting system exhibits ultrahigh energy storage, surpassing the majority of counterparts in ceramics with tetragonal tungsten bronze structures.








Abstract
Dielectric energy&#8208;storage capacitors, known for their ultrafast discharge time and high&#8208;power density, find widespread applications in high&#8208;power pulse devices. However, ceramics featuring a tetragonal tungsten bronze structure (TTBs) have received limited attention due to their lower energy&#8208;storage capacity compared to perovskite counterparts. Herein, a TTBs relaxor ferroelectric ceramic based on the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8208;1.5xSmxNb2O6 composition, exhibiting an ultrahigh recoverable energy density of 9 J cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency of 84% under an electric field of 660&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 is reported. Notably, the energy storage performance of this ceramic shows remarkable stability against frequency, temperature, and cycling electric field. The introduction of Sm3+ doping is found to create weakly coupled polar nanoregions in the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485Nb2O6 ceramic. Structural characterizations reveal that the incommensurability parameter increases with higher Sm3+ content, indicative of a highly disordered A&#8208;site structure. Simultaneously, the breakdown strength is also enhanced by raising the conduction activation energy, widening the bandgap, and reducing the electric field&#8208;induced strain. This work presents a significant improvement on the energy storage capabilities of TTBs&#8208;based capacitors, expanding the material choice for high&#8208;power pulse device applications.

         <title>Microstructured Polyelectrolyte Elastomer&#8208;Based Ionotronic Sensors with High Sensitivities and Excellent Stability for Artificial Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microstructured leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer is synthesized for ionotronic sensors, achieving a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1 and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. The broad sensing range of the sensor within the high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. A wearable keyboard and a quasicontinuous controller for a robotic arm are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors are highly demanded for artificial tactile sensing. Using ionic conductors as the dielectric layer has enabled ionotronic pressure sensors with high sensitivities owing to giant capacitance of the electric double layer (EDL) formed at the ionic conductor/electronic conductor interface. However, conventional ionotronic sensors suffer from leakage, which greatly hinders long&#8208;term stability and practical applications. Herein, a leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer as the dielectric layer for ionotronic sensors is synthesized. The mechanical and electrical properties of the polyelectrolyte elastomer are optimized, a micropyramid array is constructed, and it is used as the dielectric layer for an ionotronic pressure sensor with marked performances. The obtained sensor exhibits a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1, a high upper detecting limit on the order of 1&#160;MPa, a fast response/recovery speed of &#8776;6&#160;ms, and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. Notably, the sensor retains a high sensitivity of 4.96 kPa&#8722;1 at 500&#160;kPa, and its broad sensing range within high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. The applications of the sensor as a wearable keyboard and a quasicontinuous controller for a robotic arm are demonstrated. Durable and highly sensitive ionotronic sensors potentialize high&#8208;performance artificial skins for soft robots, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and beyond.

         <title>Understanding and Utilizing Droplet Impact on Superhydrophobic Surfaces: Phenomena, Mechanisms, Regulations, Applications, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impacts of small droplets on nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces make invaluable contributions to the big world. This review summarizes the phenomena and mechanisms of droplet impact dynamics, demonstrates the regulation strategies using surface engineering, and discusses their utilization in diverse applications. Understanding and utilizing droplet impact is of vital significance for illuminating a sustainable future.








Abstract
Droplet impact is a ubiquitous liquid behavior that closely tied to human life and production, making indispensable impacts on the big world. Nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces provide a powerful platform for regulating droplet impact dynamics. The collision between classic phenomena of droplet impact and the advanced manufacture of superhydrophobic surfaces is lighting up the future. Accurately understanding, predicting, and tailoring droplet dynamic behaviors on superhydrophobic surfaces are progressive steps to integrate the droplet impact into versatile applications and further improve the efficiency. In this review, the progress on phenomena, mechanisms, regulations, and applications of droplet impact on superhydrophobic surfaces, bridging the gap between droplet impact, superhydrophobic surfaces, and engineering applications are comprehensively summarized. It is highlighted that droplet contact and rebound are two focal points, and their fundamentals and dynamic regulations on elaborately designed superhydrophobic surfaces are discussed in detail. For the first time, diverse applications are classified into four categories according to the requirements for droplet contact and rebound. The remaining challenges are also pointed out and future directions to trigger subsequent research on droplet impact from both scientific and applied perspectives are outlined. The review is expected to provide a general framework for understanding and utilizing droplet impact.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Surface Engineered Cyanine Nanodots for Active Transport of Therapeutic Antibodies into Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput fluorescent screening of a library of single&#8208;molecule Cy5 nanodots reveals that the nanoparticle&#8208;inducing cell transcytosis is highly related to the particles' surface structures and varies significantly with cell lines. The selected Cy5 nanodots with high transcytosis&#8208;inducing capability (G5&#8208;R) can carry &#945;PD&#8208;L1 to penetrate deep into&#160;solid tumor and generates potent antitumor activity through immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor&#160;holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, active&#8208;transporting nanoparticles are harnessed to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumors through cell transcytosis. A series of molecularly precise cyanine 5&#8208;cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5&#8208;AA) is prepared. The capability of these positively charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis, and transcytosis is evaluated via fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5&#8208;R) are conjugated with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed&#8208;death ligand 1) (&#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle&#8208;mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R can greatly enhance the tumor&#8208;penetration capability through adsorption&#8208;mediated transcytosis (AMT). The effectiveness of &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R is tested in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumors, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post&#8208;surgery in clinic. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R embedded in fibrin gel can efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver &#945;PD&#8208;L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time. The active&#8208;transporting nanodots are promising platforms for efficient tumor delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules.

         <title>First Observation of Negative Capacitance in Molecular Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant negative capacitance response is directly observed in the thin film of molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium. When compared to conventional inorganic ferroelectrics, molecular ferroelectrics, in which order&#8211;disorder transition of the molecular induces the occurrence of polarization, would have a smaller ferroelectric anisotropy parameter &#945; and a larger domain wall formation energy.








Abstract
On the path of persisting Moore's Law, one of the biggest obstacles is the &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; which defines the lower limit of power consumption of individual transistors. Negative capacitance (NC) in ferroelectrics could provide a solution and has garnered significant attention in the fields of nanoelectronics, materials science, and solid&#8208;state physics. Molecular ferroelectrics, as an integral part of ferroelectrics, have developed rapidly in terms of both performance and functionality, with their inherent advantages such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, low processing temperature, and structural tunability. However, studies on the NC in molecular ferroelectrics are limited. In this study, the focus is centered on the fabricated high&#8208;quality thin films of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium(II), and a pioneering investigation on their NC responses is conducted. The findings demonstrate that the NC exhibited by molecular ferroelectrics is comparable to that of conventional HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics. This underscores the potential of molecular material systems for next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

         <title>Intelligent Delivery Systems in Tumor Metabolism Regulation: Exploring the Path Ahead</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Latest advancements in intelligent drug delivery systems (DDS) exhibit distinctive advantages, including precise sensing, programmability, feedback control, and intrinsic activity. These attributes render them conducive to facilitating multi&#8208;dimensional therapeutic approaches grounded in metabolic regulation.








Abstract
Cancer metabolism plays multifaceted roles in the initiation and progression of tumors, and interventions in metabolism are considered fundamental approaches for cancer control. Within the vast metabolic networks of tumors, there exist numerous potential therapeutic targets, intricately interconnected with each other and with signaling networks related to immunity, metastasis, drug resistance, and more. Based on the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, constructing drug delivery systems for multi&#8208;level modulation of the tumor microenvironment is proven as an effective strategy for achieving multidimensional control of cancer. Consequently, this article summarizes several features of tumor metabolism to provide insights into recent advancements in intelligent drug delivery systems for achieving multi&#8208;level regulation of the metabolic microenvironment in cancer, with the aim of offering a novel paradigm for cancer treatment.

         <title>Thermal Disorder&#8208;Induced Strain and Carrier Localization Activate Reverse Halide Segregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceeding thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) over light&#8208;induced strain can eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient responsible for segregation. Simultaneously, dynamic disorder&#8208;inducing polaron localization significantly reduces excess carrier density, thereby mitigating the impact of light&#8208;induced strain. As a result, entropy dominates the system's free energy. These insights highlight the importance of strain homogenization for stable&#8208;phase, mixed&#8208;halide perovskites.








Abstract
The reversal of halide ions is studied under various conditions. However, the underlying mechanism of heat&#8208;induced reversal remains unclear. This work finds that dynamic disorder&#8208;induced localization of self&#8208;trapped polarons and thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) can be co&#8208;acting drivers of reverse segregation. Localization of polarons results in an order of magnitude decrease in excess carrier density (polaron population), causing a reduced impact of the light&#8208;induced strain (LIS &#8211; responsible for segregation) on the perovskite framework. Meanwhile, exposing the lattice to TDIS exceeding the LIS can eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient, as thermal fluctuations of the lattice can mask the LIS strain. Under continuous 0.1&#160;W&#160;cm&#8315;2 illumination (upon segregation), the strain disorder is estimated to be 0.14%, while at 80&#160;&#176;C under dark conditions, the strain is 0.23%. However, in situ heating of the segregated film to 80&#160;&#176;C under continuous illumination (upon reversal) increases the total strain disorder to 0.25%, where TDIS is likely to have a dominant contribution. Therefore, the contribution of entropy to the system's free energy is likely to dominate, respectively. Various temperature&#8208;dependent in situ measurements and simulations further support the results. These findings highlight the importance of strain homogenization for designing stable perovskites under real&#8208;world operating conditions.

These findings highlight the importance of strain homogenization for designing stable perovskites under real-world operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design Criteria for Nanostructured Carbon Materials as Solid Contacts for Ion&#8208;Selective Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;selective microsensor arrays and wearable sensor patches require stable potentials for long&#8208;term continuous measurements. Good stability can be achieved with nanostructured carbon materials with the appropriate structure, pore architecture, and composition as solid contacts. Recommendations regarding the selection of carbon solid contacts and considerations for their characterization and testing in solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes are provided in this Perspective.








Abstract
The ability to miniaturize ion&#8208;selective sensors that enable microsensor arrays and wearable sensor patches for ion detection in environmental or biological samples requires all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sensors with solid contacts for transduction of an ion activity into an electrical signal. Nanostructured carbon materials function as effective solid contacts for this purpose. They can also contribute to improved potential signal stability, reducing the need for frequent sensor calibration. In this Perspective, the structural features of various carbon&#8208;based solid contacts described in the literature and their respective abilities to reduce potential drift during long&#8208;term, continuous measurements are compared. These carbon materials include nanoporous carbons with various architectures, carbon nanotubes, carbon black, graphene, and graphite&#8208;based solid contacts. The effects of accessibility of ionophores, ionic sites, and other components of an ion&#8208;selective membrane to the internal or external carbon surfaces are discussed, because this impacts double&#8208;layer capacitance and potential drift. The effects of carbon composition on water&#8208;layer formation are also considered, which is another contributor to potential drift during long&#8208;term measurements. Recommendations regarding the selection of solid contacts and considerations for their characterization and testing in solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes are provided.

         <title>Dielectric Filler&#8208;induced Hybrid Interphase Enabling Robust Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries at High Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fillers in composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte are mainly responsible for the enhancement of the conduction of Li ions but barely regulate the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a unique filler of dielectric NaNbO3 for the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based polymer electrolyte, which is subjected to the exchange of Li+ and Na+ during cycling, and the substituted Na+ is engaged in the construction of a fluorinated Li/Na hybrid SEI with high Young's modulus, facilitating the fast transport of Li+ at the interface at a high areal capacity and suppressing the Li dendrite growth. The dielectric NaNbO3 also induces the generation of high&#8208;dielectric &#946; phase of PVDF to promote the dissociation of Li salt. The Li/Li symmetrical cell exhibits a long&#8208;term dendrite&#8208;free cycling over 600&#160;h at a high areal capacity of 3&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2. The LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/Li solid&#8208;state cells with NaNbO3 stably cycle 2200 times at 2C and that paired with high&#8208;loading cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) can stably cycle for 150 times and exhibit excellent performances at &#8208;20&#176;C. This work provides a novel design principle of fillers undertaking interfacial engineering in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes for developing the safe and stable solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery.

         <title>Robust Organogel Scintillator for Self&#8208;healing and Ultra&#8208;flexible X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide scintillators serve as promising candidates for X&#8208;ray detection due to their high attenuation coefficients, high light yields, and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processable characteristics. However, the issues of humidity/thermal quenching and mechanical fragility, remain obstacles to the broad and diversified development of metal halide scintillators. Here we report a lead&#8208;free, water&#8208;stable, stretchable, and self&#8208;healing (ethylenebis&#8208;triphenylphosphonium manganese (II) bromide (C38H34P2)MnBr4 organogel scintillator that meets X&#8208;ray imaging in complex scenarios. The robust organogel scintillator can be stretched with elongation up to 1300% while maintaining the scintillation properties. Activated by the dynamic hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds design, the organogel scintillator exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing properties at room temperature to alleviate the vignetting problem of the rigid scintillator films, the X&#8208;ray imaging resolution can reach 16.7 lp mm&#8722;1. The organogel scintillator can also realize flexible and self&#8208;healing X&#8208;ray imaging in water, providing a design path for portable devices in harsh conditions.

         <title>Title Personalized cancer nanomedicine: Overcoming biological barriers for intracellular delivery of biopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The success of personalized medicine in oncology relies on using highly effective and precise therapeutic modalities such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Unfortunately, the clinical exploitation of these biological drugs has encountered obstacles in overcoming intricate biological barriers. Drug delivery technologies represent a plausible strategy to overcome such barriers, ultimately facilitating the access to intracellular domains. Here, an overview of the current landscape on how nanotechnology has dealt with protein corona phenomena as a first and determinant biological barrier is presented. This continues with the analysis of strategies facilitating access to the tumor, along with conceivable methods for enhanced tumor penetration. As a final step, the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must confront in order for their biological cargo to reach their target are deeply analyzed. The review concludes with a critical analysis and future perspectives of the translational advances in personalized oncological nanomedicine.

         <title>Phase&#8208;pure &#913;&#8208;Fapbi3 Perovskite Solar Cells via Activating Lead&#8208;Iodine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Narrow bandgap cubic formamidine perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) has been widely studied for its potential to achieve record&#8209;breaking efficiency. However, its high preparation difficulty caused by lattice instability has been criticized. A popular strategy for stabilizing the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 lattice is to replace intrinsic FA+ or I&#8722; with smaller ions of MA+, Cs+, Rb+, and Br&#8722;, whereas this generally leads to broadened optical bandgap and phase separation. Studies show that ions substitution&#8208;free phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 can achieve intrinsic phase stability. However, the challenging preparation of high&#8208;quality films has hindered its further development. Here, we report a facile synthesis of high&#8208;quality MA+, Cs+, Rb+, and Br&#8722;&#8208;free phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite film by a new solution modification strategy. This enables the activation of lead&#8208;iodine (Pb&#8208;I) frameworks by forming the coated Pb&#183;&#183;&#183;O network, thus simultaneously promoting spontaneous homogeneous nucleation and rapid phase transition from &#948; to &#945; phase. As a result, the efficient and stable phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSC was obtained through a one&#8208;step method without antisolvent treatment, with a record efficiency of 23.15% and excellent long&#8208;term operating stability for 500 hours under continuous light stress.

         <title>A High&#8208;Q Electric&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Magnetic Coupled Resonator for Elf/Slf Cross&#8208;Medium Magnetic Communication</title>

Abstract
Extremely/super low frequency (ELF/SLF) electromagnetic wave could effectively propagate in the harsh cross&#8208;medium environment where a high&#8208;frequency electromagnetic wave cannot pass due to the fast&#8208;decay. For efficiently transmitting a strong ELF/SLF radiation signal, the traditional electromagnetic antenna requires a super&#8208;large loop (&gt;10&#160;km). To address this issue, in this work, we report a piezoelectric ceramic/ferromagnetic heterogeneous structured, cantilever beam&#8208;type electric&#8208;mechano&#8208;magnetic (EMM) coupled resonator at only centimeter scale for ELF/SLF cross&#8208;medium magnetic communication. Through designing hard&#8208;soft hybrid step&#8208;stiffness elastic beam, the resonator exhibits a much higher quality factor Q (&#8764; 240) for ELF/SLF magnetic field transmitting, which is one to five orders of magnitude higher than those of previously reported mechanical antennas and loop coil antennas. Moreover, the resonator exhibits a 5000 times higher magnetic field emitting efficiency compared to a conventional loop coil antenna in ELF/SLF band. It also demonstrates a 200% increase in magnetic field emitting capacity compared to existing piezoelectric&#8208;driven antennas. Additionally, an ASK+PSK modulation method is proposed for suppressing relaxation time of the resonator, and a reduction in the relaxation time by 80% is observed. Furthermore, an air&#8208;seawater cross&#8208;medium magnetic field communication was successful demonstrated, indicating its potential as portable, high&#8208;efficient antenna for underwater and underground communications.

To address this issue, in this work, we report a piezoelectric ceramic/ferromagnetic heterogeneous structured, cantilever beam-type electric-mechano-magnetic (EMM) coupled resonator at only centimeter scale for ELF/SLF cross-medium magnetic communication.

         <title>A Fiber Sensor for Long&#8208;term Monitoring of Extracellular Potassium Ion Fluctuations in Chronic Neuropsychiatric Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The extracellular potassium ion concentration in the brain exerts a significant influence on cellular excitability and intercellular communication. Perturbations in the extracellular potassium ion level are closely correlated with various chronic neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. However, a critical gap persists in performing real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term monitoring of extracellular potassium ions, which is necessary for comprehensive profiling of chronic neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, a fiber potassium ion sensor (FKS) that consists of a soft conductive fiber with a rough surface and a hydrophobic&#8208;treated transduction layer interfaced with a potassium ion&#8208;selective membrane has been found to solve this problem. The FKS demonstrates stable interfaces between its distinct functional layers in an aqueous environment, conferring an exceptional stability of 6 months in vivo, in stark contrast to previous reports with working durations from hours to days. Upon implantation into the mouse brain, the FKS enables effective monitoring of extracellular potassium ion dynamics under diverse physiological states, including anesthesia, forced swimming and tail suspension. Using this FKS, we achieve tracking of extracellular potassium ion fluctuations that align with behaviors associated with the progression of depression over months, demonstrating its usability in studying chronic neuropsychiatric disorders from a new biochemical perspective.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanotechnology profoundly affects the advancement of medicine. Limitations in diagnosing and treating cancer and chronic diseases promote the growth of nanomedicine. However, there are few analytical and descriptive studies regarding the trajectory of nanomedicine, key research powers, present research landscape, focal investigative points, and future outlooks. Herein, articles and reviews published in the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection from 1st January 2000 to 18th July 2023 are analyzed. Herein, a bibliometric visualization of publication trends, countries/regions, institutions, journals, research categories, themes, references, and keywords is produced and elaborated. Nanomedicine&#8208;related academic output is increasing in since the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, solidifying the uneven global distribution of research performance. While China leads in terms of publication quantity and has numerous highly productive institutions, the USA has advantages in academic impact, commercialization, and industrial value. Nanomedicine integrates with other disciplines, establishing interdisciplinary platforms, in which drug delivery and nanoparticles remain focal points. Current research focuses on integrating nanomedicine and cell ferroptosis induction in cancer immunotherapy. The keyword &#8220;burst testing&#8221; identifies promising research directions, including immunogenic cell death, chemodynamic therapy, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, and extracellular vesicles. The prospects, major challenges, and barriers to addressing these directions are discussed.

         <title>Lotus Effect Inspired Hydrophobic Strategy for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the lotus effect, a universal strategy is proposed for achieving stable Zn metal anodes. The effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism is demonstrated by designing the metal&#8211;organometallic compound layer with zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property, in which in situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic groups are constructed.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H2O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)&#8208;modified Cu@Zn (SA&#8208;Cu@Zn) anode as an example, this work illustrates how the lotus effect controls the H2O adsorption energy on the Zn metal anode. In situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long&#8208;chain alkyl groups are constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, which improves the electrochemical performance of the Zn||V2O5 full cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with water contact angle (CA) measurements demonstrate that the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn exhibits larger water CA and weaker H2O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how the excellent reversibility is achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIB anodes.

         <title>Magnetic Aggregation&#8208;Induced Bone&#8208;Targeting Nanocarrier with Effects of Piezo1 Activation and Osteogenic&#8211;Angiogenic Coupling for Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osteoporosis, characterized by an imbalance in bone homeostasis, is a global health concern. Bone defects are difficult to heal in patients with osteoporosis. Classical drug treatments for osteoporotic bone defects have unsatisfactory efficacy owing to side effects and imprecise delivery problems. In this study, a magnetic aggregation&#8208;induced bone&#8208;targeting poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid, PLGA)&#8208;based nanocarrier (ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO) is synthesized to realize dual&#8208;targeted delivery and precise Piezo1&#8208;activated therapy for osteoporotic bone defects. Piezo1 is an important mechanotransducer that plays a key role in regulating bone homeostasis. To achieve dual&#8208;targeting properties, ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO is fabricated using zoledronate (ZOL)&#8208;decorated PLGA, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), and Piezo1&#8208;activated molecule Yoda1 via the emulsion solvent diffusion method. Bone&#8208;targeting molecular mediation and magnetic aggregation&#8208;induced properties can jointly and effectively achieve precise delivery to localized bone defects. Moreover, Yoda1 loading enables targeted and efficient mimicking of mechanical signals and activation of Piezo1. Experiments in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO can activate Piezo1 in bone defect areas of osteoporotic mice, improve osteogenesis through YAP/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling axis, promote a well&#8208;coordinated osteogenesis&#8211;angiogenesis coupling, and significantly accelerate bone reconstruction within the defects without noticeable side effects. Overall, this novel dual&#8208;targeting nanocarrier provides a potentially effective strategy for the clinical treatment of osteoporotic bone defects.

         <title>Harmonizing Thickness And Permeability in Bone Tissue Engineering: A Novel Silk Fibroin Membrane Inspired by Spider Silk Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Guided bone regeneration (GBR) gathers significant interest in the realm of bone tissue engineering; however, the interplay between membrane thickness and permeability continues to pose a challenge which can be addressed by the water&#8208;collecting mechanism of spider silk, where water droplets efficiently move from smooth filaments to rough conical nodules. Inspired by the natural design of spider silk, we develop an innovative silk fibroin membrane featuring directional fluid transportation via harmoniously integrating a smooth, dense layer with a rough, loose layer; conical microchannels are engineered in the smooth and compact layer. Consequently, double&#8208;layered membrane with cone&#8208;shaped microporous passageways (CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane) are designed for in situ bone repair. Through extensive in vitro testing, we note that the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane guides liquid flow from the the compact layer's surface to the loose layer, enabling rapid diffusion. Remarkably, the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane demonstrate superior mechanical properties, resistance to bacterial adhesion. When apply in vivo, the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane achieve results on par with the commercial Bio&#8208;Gide collagen membranes. This innovative integration of a cross&#8208;thickness wetting gradient structure offers a novel solution, harmonizing the often conflicting requirements of material transport, mechanical strength, and barrier effectiveness, while also addressing issues relate to tissue engineering scaffold perfusion.

         <title>Vacancy defects inductive effect of asymmetrically coordinated single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites for robust electrocatalytic oxygen reduction with high turnover frequency and mass activity</title>

Abstract
The development of facile, efficient synthesis method to construct low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely important, yet still challenging. Herein, we report an atomically dispersed N, S co&#8208;doped carbon with abundant vacancy defects (NSC&#8208;vd) anchored Fe single atoms (SAs) derived from coal pitch by an encapsulation&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy and propose a vacancy defects inductive effect based on asymmetrically coordinated Fe SAs/NSC&#8208;vd catalyst for promoting electrocatalytic ORR. The optimized catalyst featured of stable Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites exhibits high ORR activity with turnover frequency (18.5 and 2.87 s&#8722;1) and mass activity (56.2 and 15.9 A mg&#8722;1), which are 132 and 11, 312 and 42 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C at 0.87 and 0.74&#160;V in 0.1&#160;M KOH and 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, respectively. In&#8208;situ Raman and attenuated total reflectance surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveal the Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites are beneficial to the generation of OH&#8722; species and exhibits different kinetic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline solutions. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the ORR activity of Fe SAs/NSC&#8208;vd catalyst in different electrolyte is closely related to the coordination structure. The Fe&#8208;N coordination is major contributor as active site for O2 adsorption&#8208;activation in 0.1&#160;M KOH, while the Fe&#8208;S coordination is main active center for ORR in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Theoretical calculation reveals that the upshifted d band center of Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites facilitate the adsorption of O2 and accelerate the kinetics process of *OH reduction. The abundant vacancy defects around the Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites balance the OOH* formation and *OH reduction, thus synergetic promoting the electrocatalytic ORR process. This work proposes a novel controllable synthesis method and structural regulation strategy of SACs for high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic ORR in energy conversion devices.

         <title>Recycling and Reusing of Graphite from Retired Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The proliferation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) over the past decade has led to a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) powered by these batteries reaching the end of their lifespan. With retired EVs becoming more prevalent, the recycling and reuse of their components, particularly graphite, has become imperative as the world transitions towards electric mobility. Graphite constitutes approximately 20% of LIBs by weight, making it a valuable resource to be conserved. This review presents an in&#8208;depth analysis of the current global graphite mining landscape and explores potential opportunities for the &#8220;second life&#8221; of graphite originating from depleted LIBs. Various existing recycling and reactivation technologies in both industry and academia are discussed, along with potential applications for the recycled graphite. Understanding these processes is crucial as they form a vital aspect of the waste management hierarchy. Furthermore, this review addresses the future challenges faced by the recycling industry in dealing with expired LIBs, encompassing environmental, economic, legal, and regulatory considerations. These challenges must be carefully examined to ensure sustainable and responsible recycling practices. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the developments in recycling and reusing graphite from retired LIBs, offering valuable insights for forthcoming large&#8208;scale recycling efforts. It emphasizes the need to consider individual perspectives and align efforts towards an efficient and environmentally friendly recycling strategy, essential for the continued growth of electric mobility.

         <title>CTL&#8208;inspired Killing System Using Ultralow&#8208;dose Chemical&#8208;drugs to Induce A Pyroptosis&#8208;mediated Antitumour Immune Function</title>

Abstract
A Cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;inspired system capable of using ultralow&#8208;dose chemical drugs to manipulate cell death is needed to investigate the antitumour immunotherapy. Recent studies revealed pyroptosis, a type of immunogenic cell death, could promote antitumour immune function. However, high&#8208;dose chemotherapy led to cytokine release syndrome by pyroptosis. Therefore, pyroptosis&#8208;inducing ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy was potential in preclinical and clinical research, but its efficacy, safety and the antitumour immune responses were not clear. Here, we established a near&#8208;infrared light controllable killing system (BIK system) by which ultralow&#8208;dose doxorubicin could be spatiotemporally transported to immunosuppressive tumour cells and mediate efficient pyroptosis. Compared with using DOX directly, the BIK system reduced total drug consumption to less than one&#8208;thirtieth the common dose in vitro. MPI imaging and fluorescence imaging showed our BIK system exhibited good tumour targeting and tumour penetration. We applied this system for pyroptosis&#8208;induced antitumor therapies, and the results showed that less than c.a. 25&#160;&#956;g kg&#8722;1 DOX was sufficient for GSDME&#8208;positive tumour regression with negligible injuries to major organs. Moreover, the gasdermin&#8208;deficient 4T1 tumours could be controlled by combining BIK system with decitabine treatment. The antitumour immune function were proven to correlate with the impressive efficacy of pyroptosis&#8208;inducing ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy, and the concomitant immune memory prevented metastasis. Compare to pyroptosis&#8208;inducing ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy, the boost in T&#8208;cell infiltration after high&#8208;dose DOX treatment was relative weak, and it failed to improve immunosuppression and block lung metastases. Owing to the robust antitumour immune function induced by BIK system, advanced&#8208;stage bulky tumours could be controlled or shrunken by synergizing with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 therapy. This study provided new insights into the design of nanoassisted systems for activating the antitumour immune function by microstimulation; our application of the BIK system suggested that ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy was sufficient for inducing a robust pyroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumour immune function.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sleek High Entropy Alloy Tights: Realizing Superior Cyclability for Anode&#8208;Free Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of Li&#8208;free anodes to inhibit Li dendrite formation and provide high energy density Li batteries is highly applauded. However, the lithiophobic interphase and heterogeneous Li deposition hindered the practical application. In this work, a 20&#160;nm ultra&#8208;sleek high entropy alloy (HEA, NiCdCuInZn) tights w ere developed by a thermodynamically driven phase transition method. Multiple Li+ transport paths and abundant active sites are enabled by the cocktail effect of different constituent elements in HEA. These active sites with gradient absorption energies (&#8208;3.18&#8764;&#8208;2.03&#160;eV) facilitate selective binding, providing a low barrier for homogeneous Li nucleation. Simultaneously, multiple transport paths promote Li diffusion behavior with uniform Li deposition. Thus, the HEA/C achieves high reversibility of Li plating/stripping processes over 2000 cycles with a CE of 99.6% at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in asymmetric cells, as well as over 7200&#160;h at 60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/60 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Moreover, the full cell with the HEA/C host without Li metal and a high&#8208;loading (17.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) NCM&#8208;811 cathode has an average CE of 99.5% at 1 C after 160 cycles. This advanced HEA structure design shows a favorable potential application for anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries.

         <title>Molecular Engineering toward Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and proposes a variety of design principles. Various organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively and systematically summarized to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs for lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density are becoming increasingly important in global sustainability initiatives. However, uncontrollable dendrite seeds, inscrutable interfacial chemistry, and repetitively formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have severely hindered the advancement of LMBs. Organic molecules have been ingeniously engineered to construct targeted SEI and effectively minimize the above issues. In this review, multiple organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively summarized and insights into how to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs are provided. A variety of meticulously selected cases are analyzed in depth to support the arguments of molecular design in SEI. Specifically, the evolution of organic molecules&#8208;derived SEI is discussed and corresponding design principles are proposed, which are beneficial in guiding researchers to understand and architect SEI based on organic molecules. This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived SEI and will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the exploitation of LMBs.

         <title>Distinguished Roles of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Sp2 And Sp3 Hybridized Carbon on Extraordinary Supercapacitance in Acidic Aqueous Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The acidic aqueous supercapacitors have been found to deliver appealing capacitive properties due to fast ion diffusion caused by the applied smallest size of hydrion. However, their practical applications are largely inhibited by the narrow electrochemical stability window of water (1.23&#160;V). Herein, we report a nitrogen&#8208;enriched porous carbon, consisting of varied nitrogen doping bonded on sp2 and sp3 carbon sites, which are capable of stimulating a wider potential window up to 1.4&#160;V and thus resulting in a great enhancement of capacitive performance in aqueous acidic electrolytes. Together with the improved electrical conductivity and preferable hydrion diffusion, the as&#8208;prepared nitrogen&#8208;enriched porous carbon materials (RNOPCs) exhibit an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance (1084 F cm&#8722;3) in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Besides, a fully packed RNOPCs&#8208;based symmetrical supercapacitor can deliver a high gravimetric and volumetric energy density of 31.8&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1 and 54.3&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 respectively, approaching those of lead acid batteries (25&#8208;35&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1). The first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the lone pair electrons of the doped nitrogen can be delocalized on its neighboring carbon atoms, improving charge uptakes and overpotentials. Such facile and scale&#8208;up production of carbon&#8208;based supercapacitors can bridge the gap of energy density between traditional supercapacitors and batteries in aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>A &#8220;One Arrow Three Eagle&#8221; Strategy to Improve CM&#8208;272 Primed Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 cannot only promote the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated SDT but also reduce the high level of GSH to enhance the reactive oxygen species, inducing ferroptosis and apoptosis. Significantly, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 actives ICD to enhance T&#8208;cell receptor activation to better respond to ICI (&#945;PD&#8208;1). Hence, this effective &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; strategy improves CM&#8208;272 primed bladder cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy using an immune&#8208;checkpoint blockade has significantly improved its therapeutic effects. CM&#8208;272, which is a novel epigenetic inhibitor of G9a, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) for recovering the sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies; however, the efficacy of CM&#8208;272 is greatly limited by promoting the transcription activity of HIF&#8208;1&#945; to form a hypoxic environment. Here, a Fe3+&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MIL&#8208;53) is used to load CM&#8208;272 (ultra&#8208;high loading rate of 56.4%) for realizing an MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 nanoplatform. After entering bladder cancer cells, Fe3+ not only promotes the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated sonodynamic therapy but reduces the high level of glutathione in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for enhancing reactive oxygen species, including ferroptosis and apoptosis. MIL&#8208;53 carriers can be degraded in response to the TME, accelerating the release of CM&#8208;272, which helps achieve the maximum effectiveness in an O2&#8208;sufficient TME by attenuating drug resistance. Furthermore, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 enhances dendritic cell maturation and synergistically combines it with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 antibody during the study of immune&#8208;related pathways in the transcriptomes of bladder cancer cells using RNA&#8208;seq. This study presents the first instance of amalgamating nanomedicine with CM&#8208;272, inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD to achieve the &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; effect.

         <title>The Key Role of Molecular Packing in Luminescence Property: From Adjacent Molecules to Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly discusses the molecular aggregation science behind luminescence materials. From the basic packing modes of adjacent molecules to the various aggregated structures, the efficient bridge between molecular structures and luminescence property has been roughly built to promote their development from internal to external.








Abstract
The luminescence materials act as the key components in many functional devices, as well as the detection and imaging systems, which can be permeated in each aspect of modern life, and attract more and more attention for the creative technology and applications. In addition to the diverse properties of organic luminogens, the multiple molecular packing at aggregated states frequently offers new and/or exciting performance. However, there still lacks comprehensive analysis of molecular packing in these organic materials, resulting in an increased gap between molecular design and practical applications. In this review, from the basic knowledge of organic compounds as single molecules, to the discernable property of excimer, charge transfer (CT) complex or self&#8208;assembly systems by adjacent molecules, and finally to the opto&#8208;electronic performance of molecular aggregates, the relevant factors to molecular packing and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Microwave Phosphine&#8208;plasma Assisted Ultrafast Synthesis of Halogen&#8208;doped Ru/RuP2 with Surface Intermediate Adsorption Modulation for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anionic modification engineering is a crucial approach to develop highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, halogen elements (X = Cl, Br, and I) modified Ru&#8208;based nanosheets (X&#8208;Ru/RuP2) is designed by rapid and eco&#8208;friendly microwave&#8208;phosphide plasma approach within 60 s. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the introduced halogen element, especially Br, could optimize the surface intermediates adsorption. Specially, the designed Br&#8208;Ru/RuP2 favors the water dissociation and following hydrogen adsorption/desorption process. Then, the as&#8208;synthesized Br&#8208;Ru/RuP2 exhibits low overpotential of 34&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 coupled with small Tafel slope of 27&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the electrocatalytic performances in acid and neutral media are also boosted via Br element modification. This work paves a novel way to regulate the electronic structure of Ru&#8208;based compounds, and then can boost the electrocatalytic kinetics.

         <title>Engineering Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8211;N1S2 Sites via Chemical Vapor Deposition to Boost Enzyme&#8208;Like Activity for Efficient Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), with well&#8208;defined and uniform atomic structures, are an emerging type of natural enzyme mimics. Currently, it is important but challenging to rationally design high&#8208;performance SAzymes and deeply reveal the interaction mechanism between SAzymes and substrate molecules. Herein, we reported the controllable fabrication of a unique Cu&#8722;N1S2&#8208;centred SAzyme (Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C) via a chemical vapor deposition&#8208;based sulfur&#8208;engineering strategy. Benefiting from the optimized geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom sites, Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C SAzyme shows boosted enzyme&#8208;like activity, especially in catalase&#8208;like activity, with a 13.8&#8208;fold increase in the affinity to H2O2 substrate and a 65.2&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency when compared to Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C SAzyme with Cu&#8722;N3 sites. Further theoretical studies reveal that the increased electron density around single&#8208;atom Cu is achieved through electron redistribution, and the efficient charge transfer between Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C and H2O2 is demonstrated to be more beneficial for the adsorption and activation of H2O2. The as&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C SAzyme possesses an excellent antitumor effect through the synergy of catalytic therapy and oxygen&#8208;dependent phototherapy. This study provides a strategy for the rational design of SAzymes, and the proposed electron redistribution and charge transfer mechanism will help to understand the coordination environment effect of single&#8208;atom metal sites on H2O2&#8208;mediated enzyme&#8208;like catalytic processes.

         <title>On&#8208;Command Disassembly of Microrobotic Superstructures for Transport and Delivery of Magnetic Micromachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic microrobots have been developed for navigating microscale environments by means of remote magnetic fields. However, limited propulsion speeds at small scales remain an issue in the maneuverability of these devices as magnetic force and torque are proportional to their magnetic volume. Here, we propose a microrobotic superstructure, which, as analogous to a supramolecular system, consists of two or more microrobotic units that are interconnected and organized through a physical (transient) component (a polymeric frame or a thread). Our superstructures consist of microfabricated magnetic helical micromachines interlocked by a magnetic gelatin nanocomposite containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). While the microhelices enable the motion of the superstructure, the IONPs serve as heating transducers for dissolving the gelatin chassis via magnetic hyperthermia. In a practical demonstration, we showcase the superstructure's motion with a gradient magnetic field in a large channel, the disassembly of the superstructure and release of the helical micromachines by a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, and the corkscrew locomotion of the released helices through a small channel via a rotating magnetic field. This adaptable microrobotic superstructure reacts to different magnetic inputs, which could be used to perform complex delivery procedures within intricate regions of the human body.

         <title>Engineering the Dielectric Constants of Polymers: From Molecular to Mesoscopic Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymers are essential components of modern&#8208;day materials and are widely used in various fields. The dielectric constant, a key physical parameter, plays a fundamental role in the light&#8208;, electricity&#8208;, and magnetism&#8208;related applications of polymers, such as dielectric and electrical insulation, battery and photovoltaic fabrication, sensing and electrical contact, and signal transmission and communication. Over the past few decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to engineering the intrinsic dielectric constant of polymers, particularly by tailoring the induced and orientational polarization modes and ferroelectric domain engineering. Investigations into these methods have guided the rational design and on&#8208;demand preparation of polymers with desired dielectric constants. This review article exhaustively summarizes the dielectric constant engineering of polymers from molecular to mesoscopic scales, with emphasis on application&#8208;driven design and on&#8208;demand polymer synthesis rooted in polymer chemistry principles. Additionally, it explores the key polymer applications that can benefit from dielectric constant regulation and outlines the future prospects of this field.

         <title>Bifunctional Interphase Promotes Li+ De&#8208;Solvation and Transportation Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging Graphite Anode at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The most successful lithium&#8208;ion batterie (LIBs) based on ethylene carbonate(EC) electrolytes and graphite anodes still suffer from severe energy and power loss at temperatures below &#8208;20&#176;C, which is because of high viscosity or even solidification of electrolytes, sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Li+ at the electrode surface, and slow Li+ transportation in solid electrolyte interphase(SEI). Here we engineered a coherent lithium phosphide(Li3P) coating firmly bonding to the graphite surface to effectively address these challenges. The dense, continuous, and robust Li3P interphase with high ionic conductivity enhances Li+ transportation across the SEI. Plus, it promotes Li+ de&#8208;solvation through an electron transfer mechanism, which simultaneously accelerates the charge transport kinetics and stands against the co&#8208;intercalation of low&#8208;melting&#8208;point solvent molecules, such as propylene carbonate(PC), 1,3&#8208;dioxolane(DOL), and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane(DME). Consequently, we achieved an unprecedented combination of high&#8208;capacity retention and fast&#8208;charging ability for LIBs at low temperatures. In full cells encompassing the Li3P&#8208;coated graphite anode and PC electrolytes, an impressive 70% of their room&#8208;temperature capacity was attained at &#8208;20&#176;C with a 4C charging rate and a 65% capacity retention was achieved at &#8208;40&#176;C with a 0.05C charging rate. This research pioneers a transformative trajectory in fortifying LIB performance in cryogenic environments.

&lt;p&gt;The most successful lithium-ion batterie (LIBs) based on ethylene carbonate(EC) electrolytes and graphite anodes still suffer from severe energy and power loss at temperatures below -20&#176;C, which is because of high viscosity or even solidification of electrolytes, sluggish de-solvation of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at the electrode surface, and slow Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transportation in solid electrolyte interphase(SEI).

         <title>19.32% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by Fine&#8208;Tuning Stacking Modes of Y&#8208;Type Molecule Acceptors: Synergistic Bromine and Fluorine Substitution of the End Groups</title>

Abstract
The success of Y6&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) in polymer solar cells (PSCs) can be attributed to their unique honeycomb stacking style, which leads to favorable thin&#8208;film morphologies. The intermolecular interactions related to the crystallization tendency of these NF&#8208;SMAs is closely governed by their electron accepting end groups. For example, the high performance Y6 derivative L8&#8208;BO (BTP&#8208;4F) presents three types of stacking modes in contrast to two stacking modes of Y6. Hence, it is ultimately interesting to obtain more insight on the packing properties and the preferences influenced by chemical modifications such as end group engineering. In this work, we designed and synthesized asymmetric and symmetric L8&#8208;BO derivatives with brominated end groups and explored the stacking preferences in various modes. The asymmetric BTP&#8208;3FBr displayed an optimized crystallization tendency and thin film morphology, leading to a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.34% in binary devices and a top PCE of 19.32% in ternary devices containing 15 wt% IDIC as the second acceptor.

         <title>Thorough Optimization for Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) with a high efficiency is of significance for practical application. However, their efficiencies lag far behind those of rigid or even flexible counterparts. To address this issue, we design and fabricate an advanced top&#8208;illuminated OPV, which is intrinsically stretchable and has a high performance, through systematic optimizations from material to device. First, the stretchability of the active layer was largely increased by adding a low&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus elastomer of styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;propylene&#8208;styrene tri&#8208;block copolymer (SEPS). Second, the stretchability and conductivity of the opaque electrode were enhanced by a conductive polymer/metal (denoted as M&#8208;PH1000@Ag) composite electrode strategy. Third, the optical and electrical properties of a Ag nanowire transparent electrode were improved by a solvent vapor annealing strategy. We successfully fabricated high&#8208;performance is&#8208;OPVs with a top&#8208;illuminated structure, which provided a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.23%. Additionally, by incorporating 5&#8211;10% elastomer, we achieved a balance between the efficiency and stretchability of the is&#8208;OPVs. This study provides valuable insights into material and device optimizations for high&#8208;efficiency is&#8208;OPVs, with a low&#8208;cost production and excellent stretchability, which indicates a high potential for future applications of OPVs.

         <title>Continuous Melt Spinning of Covalently Cross&#8208;Linked Self&#8208;Healing Ionogel Fibers for Multi&#8208;Functional Ionotronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Stretchable conductive fibers play key roles in electronic textiles, which have substantial improvements in terms of flexibility, breathability, and comfort. Compared to most existing electron&#8208;conductive fibers, ion&#8208;conductive fibers are usually soft, stretchable, and transparent, leading to increasing attention. However, the integration of desirable functions including high transparency, stretchability, conductivity, solvent resistance, self&#8208;healing ability, processability, and recyclability remains a challenge to be addressed. In the current research, we proposed a new molecular strategy based on dynamic covalent cross&#8208;linking networks to enable continuous melt spinning of the ionogel fiber with the aforementioned properties. As a proof of concept, covalently cross&#8208;linked ionogel fibers based on dimethylglyoximeurethane (DOU) groups (DOU&#8208;IG fiber) were prepared. The resultant DOU&#8208;IG fiber exhibited high transparency (&gt; 93%), tensile strength (0.76&#160;MPa), stretchability (784%), and solvent resistance. Owing to the dynamic of DOU groups, the DOU&#8208;IG fiber showed high healing performance using near&#8208;infrared light. Taking advantage of DOU&#8208;IG fibers, multifunctional ionotronics with the integration of several desirable functionalities including sensor, triboelectric nanogenerator, and electroluminescent display were fabricated and used for motion monitoring, energy harvesting, and human&#8208;machine interaction. It is believed that these DOU&#8208;IG fibers are promising for fabricating the next generation of electronic textiles and other wearable electronics.

         <title>Significance of Engineering The MnO6 Octahedral Units to Promote The Oxygen Reduction Reaction of Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electronic structure and geometric configuration of catalysts play a crucial role to design novel perovskite&#8208;type catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nowadays, many studies are more concerned with the influence of electronic structure and ignore the geometric effect, which plays a nonnegligible role in enhancing catalytic performances. Herein, we regulate the MnO6 octahedral tilting degree of LaMnO3 by modulating the concentration of Y3+, excluding the electronic effect from the valence state of manganese. Plotting the MnO6 octahedral tilting degree as a function of concentration of Y3+ produces a volcano&#8208;shaped plot. The octahedral tilting can reduce the Mn&#8722;O covalency, generating more highly active Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies during ORR process. The specific activity has a positive correlation with octahedral tilting degree. Meanwhile, the octahedral tilting stabilizes Mn&#8722;O interactions during ORR process and promote stability. Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, octahedral tilting alters the rate&#8208;determining step and decrease the energy barrier. Subsequent extended experiment confirmed that octahedral tilting is the key factor to affect the catalytic performances.

Nowadays, many studies are more concerned with the influence of electronic structure and ignore the geometric effect, which plays a nonnegligible role in enhancing catalytic performances. Herein, we regulate the MnO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedral tilting degree of LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by modulating the concentration of Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, excluding the electronic effect from the valence state of manganese. Plotting the MnO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedral tilting degree as a function of concentration of Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; produces a volcano-shaped plot. The octahedral tilting can reduce the Mn&#8722;O covalency, generating more highly active Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and oxygen vacancies during ORR process. The specific activity has a positive correlation with octahedral tilting degree. Meanwhile, the octahedral tilting stabilizes Mn&#8722;O interactions during ORR process and promote stability. Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, octahedral tilting alters the rate-determining step and decrease the energy barrier. Subsequent extended experiment confirmed that octahedral tilting is the key factor to affect the catalytic performances.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Novel Ferroelectric Rashba Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fast, reversible, and low&#8208;power manipulation of the spin texture is crucial for next generation spintronic devices like non&#8208;volatile bipolar memories, switchable spin current injectors or spin field effect transistors. Ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors (FERSC) are the ideal class of materials for the realization of such devices. Their ferroelectric character enables an electronic control of the Rashba&#8208;type spin texture by means of the reversible and switchable polarization. Yet, only very few materials have been established to belong to this class of multifunctional materials. Here, Pb1&#8208;xGexTe is unraveled as a novel FERSC system down to nanoscale. The ferroelectric phase transition and concomitant lattice distortion is demonstrated by temperature dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, and its effect on electronic properties are measured by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In few nanometer&#8208;thick epitaxial heterostructures, a large Rashba spin&#8208;splitting is exhibiting a wide tuning range as a function of temperature and Ge content. Our work defines Pb1&#8208;xGexTe as a high&#8208;potential FERSC system for spintronic applications.

         <title>Synchronous Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Variants via Receptonics Based on Modeling Receptor&#8210;Ligand Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A receptor&#8211;ligand binding reaction based receptonics platform is presented as a facile diagnostic device to discriminate numerous strains of respiratory viruses. Diagnosis of respiratory viruses and their variants indicate its potential as on&#8208;site screening platform for fatal diseases without the need for complex additional equipment. The newly developed receptonics shows the possibility for the application of clinical samples and samples from primate model.








Abstract
The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on&#8208;site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory viruses continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on&#8208;site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, a facile diagnostic device is presented for multi&#8208;detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. The novel bioreceptor&#8208;treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell&#8208;entry receptors conjugated to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). An ultrasensitive multi&#8208;detection performance is achieved without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. This multi&#8208;screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.

         <title>Interfacial Rivet to Fill Structural Defects: A Spacer Engineering Gift for 3d Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The combination of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites to passivate surfaces or interfaces with a high concentration of defects shows great promise for improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) efficiency. Constructing high&#8208;quality perovskite film systems by precisely modulating 2D perovskites with good morphologies and growth sites on 3D perovskite films remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of spacer&#8208;engineered surface reactions. In this study, phase&#8208;pure 2D (HA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with a controlled number of layers (n) were separated on a large scale and exploited as interface rivets to optimize 3D perovskite films, resulting in tunable film structural defects and grain boundaries. The optimized PSC system benefits from a reduction in non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in improved optical performance, higher mobility, and lower trap density. The corresponding device achieved a championship power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25%, especially for voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The quality and uniformity of the perovskite films were further confirmed using large&#8208;area devices with an active area of 14 cm2, which exhibited a PCE of more than 21.24%. The high&#8208;quality thin&#8208;film system based on the 2D perovskites presented herein provides a new perspective for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.

         <title>Empowering CO2 Eco&#8208;Refrigeration with Colossal Breathing&#8208;Caloric&#8208;Like Effects in MOF&#8208;508b</title>

Abstract
Today, around 20% of the electric consumption is devoted to refrigeration, while around 50% of the final energy is dedicated to heating applications. In this scenario, many cooling devices and heat&#8208;pumps are transitioning towards the use of CO2 as an eco&#8208;friendly refrigerant, favouring carbon circular economy. Nevertheless, CO2 still has some limitations, such as large operating pressures (70&#8208;150&#160;bar) and a critical point at 31&#160;&#176;C, which compromise efficiency and increase technological complexity. Very recently, we have reported an innovative breathing&#8208;caloric mechanism in the MIL&#8208;53(Al) compound, which implies gas adsorption under CO2 pressurization boosted by structural transitions, and which overcomes the limitations of stand&#8208;alone CO2. Here, we report the breathing&#8208;caloric&#8208;like effects of MOF&#8208;508b, surpassing by 40% those of MIL&#8208;53(Al). Moreover, we present the first thermometry device operating at room temperature and under the application of only 26&#160;bar of CO2. Under those conditions, our material presents values of &#916;T &#8764; 30 K, reaching heating temperatures of 56&#160;&#176;C and cooling temperatures of &#8208;10&#160;&#176;C, which are already useful for space heating, air&#8208;conditioning, food refrigeration and freezing applications.

         <title>Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Intrinsic Charge Generation in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) can generate charges without a donor&#8211;acceptor interface. This is shown using transient absorption measurements and confirmed using computational methods. A small amount of donor material significantly enhances exciton splitting into free charges, resulting in well&#8208;performing donor&#8208;dilute OPVs. Semitransparent OPV modules with 2.2% light utilization efficiency are achieved by employing the optimized donor&#8208;dilute device concept.








Abstract
In organic semiconductors, a donor/acceptor heterojunction is typically required for efficient dissociation of excitons. Using transient absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamics of excited states in non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), it is shown that NFAs can generate charges without a donor/acceptor interface. This is due to the fact that dielectric solvation provides a driving force sufficient to dissociate the excited state and form the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The CT state is further dissociated into free charges at interfaces between polycrystalline regions in neat NFAs. For IEICO&#8208;4F, incorporating just 9 wt% donor polymer PTB7&#8208;Th in neat films greatly boosts charge generation, enhancing efficient exciton separation into free charges. This property is utilized to fabricate donor&#8208;dilute organic photovoltaics (OPV) delivering a power conversion efficiency of 8.3% in the case of opaque devices with a metal top&#8208;electrode and an active layer average visible transmittance (AVT) of 75%. It is shown that the intrinsic charge generation in low&#8208;bandgap NFAs contributes to the overall photocurrent generation. IEICO&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPVs with limited PTB7&#8208;Th content have high thermal resilience demonstrating little drop in performance over 700&#160;h. PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F semitransparent OPVs are leveraged to fabricate an 8&#8208;series connected semitransparent module, demonstrating light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 2.2% alongside an AVT of 63%.

&lt;p&gt;Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) can generate charges without a donor&#8211;acceptor interface. This is shown using transient absorption measurements and confirmed using computational methods. A small amount of donor material significantly enhances exciton splitting into free charges, resulting in well-performing donor-dilute OPVs. Semitransparent OPV modules with 2.2% light utilization efficiency are achieved by employing the optimized donor-dilute device concept.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In organic semiconductors, a donor/acceptor heterojunction is typically required for efficient dissociation of excitons. Using transient absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamics of excited states in non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), it is shown that NFAs can generate charges without a donor/acceptor interface. This is due to the fact that dielectric solvation provides a driving force sufficient to dissociate the excited state and form the charge-transfer (CT) state. The CT state is further dissociated into free charges at interfaces between polycrystalline regions in neat NFAs. For IEICO-4F, incorporating just 9 wt% donor polymer PTB7-Th in neat films greatly boosts charge generation, enhancing efficient exciton separation into free charges. This property is utilized to fabricate donor-dilute organic photovoltaics (OPV) delivering a power conversion efficiency of 8.3% in the case of opaque devices with a metal top-electrode and an active layer average visible transmittance (AVT) of 75%. It is shown that the intrinsic charge generation in low-bandgap NFAs contributes to the overall photocurrent generation. IEICO-4F-based OPVs with limited PTB7-Th content have high thermal resilience demonstrating little drop in performance over 700&#160;h. PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F semitransparent OPVs are leveraged to fabricate an 8-series connected semitransparent module, demonstrating light-utilization efficiency of 2.2% alongside an AVT of 63%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Flexible and High&#8208;Performing Thermoelectrics by Direct Laser Printing on Plastic Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The emerging fields of wearables and the Internet of Things introduce the need for electronics and power sources with unconventional form factor: large area, customizable shape and flexibility. Thermoelectric generators can power those systems by converting abundant waste heat into electricity, whereas the versatility of additive manufacturing suits heterogenous form factors. Here, additive manufacturing of high&#8208;performing flexible thermoelectrics is proposed. Maskless and large&#8208;area patterning of Bi2Te3&#8208;based films is performed by laser powder bed fusion directly on plastic foil. Mechanical interlocking allows simultaneously patterning, sintering and attachment of the films to the substrate without using organic binders that jeopardize the final performance. Material waste could be minimized by recycling the unexposed powder. The particular microstructure of the laser&#8208;printed material renders the &#8208;otherwise brittle&#8208; Bi2Te3 films highly flexible despite their high thickness. The films survive 500 extreme&#8208;bending cycles to a 0.76&#160;mm radius. Power factors above 1500 &#956;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;2 and a record&#8208;low sheet resistance for flexible thermoelectrics of 0.4 &#937;/sq are achieved, leading to unprecedented potential for power generation. Our versatile fabrication route enables innovative implementations such as cuttable arrays to adapt device layout to specific applications like self&#8208;powered sensing and energy harvesting from unusual scenarios like human skin and curved hot surfaces.

         <title>Unifying and suppressing conduction losses of polymer dielectrics for superior high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Superior high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance of polymer dielectrics is extremely critical for the modern film capacitor demanded in the harsh&#8208;environment electronic and electrical systems. Unfortunately, the energy storage capabilities of polymer dielectrics degrade rapidly at elevated temperatures and electric fields owing to the exponential increase of conduction loss. The conduction loss at high temperatures and electric fields is mainly composed of electrode&#8208;limited conduction and bulk&#8208;limited conduction. Herein, we depart from prior work by unifying the contribution of the above two factors to conduction loss and fundamentally suppress the conduction and energy losses of polymer dielectrics at elevated temperatures. The experimental results demonstrate that the polar oxygen&#8208;containing groups, generated on the surface of polymer dielectrics during the exposure to an ultraviolet (UV) source, can act as the charges trap site to immobilize the injected charges from metal electrodes and these trapped charges can in turn establish a built&#8208;in field to weaken the external electric field, consequently augmenting the injection barrier height and suppressing the electrode&#8208;limited conduction loss. Wide bandgap aluminium oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles fillers can not only act as a physical block center to dissipate the kinetic energy of injected or thermally activated charges but also serve as deep traps to constrain the charges transport in dielectrics, accordingly contributing to the inhibition of bulk&#8208;limited conduction loss. From this, at 150&#176;C, the discharged energy density (Ue) with a discharge&#8208;charge efficiency (&#951;) of 90% increases by 324.63% from 1.34 J/cm3 for pristine PEI to 5.69 J/cm3 for UV&#8208;Al2O3/polyetherimide (PEI) film. Moreover, the pristine PEI could merely deliver a Ue of 0.31 J/cm3 with a &#951; of around 90% up to 200&#176;C while the UV&#8208;Al2O3/PEI exhibits an increase of 1058.06% with a Ue of 3.59 J/cm3 at 500 MV/m, which outperforms most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics. The principle of simultaneously inhibiting the electrode&#8208;limited and bulk&#8208;limited conduction loss could be easily extended to other polymer dielectrics for high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance.

         <title>Organic High&#8208;Temperature Synaptic Phototransistors for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>

Abstract
Organic optoelectronic synaptic devices that can reliably operate in high&#8208;temperature environments (i.e., beyond 121&#176;C) or remain stable after high&#8208;temperature treatments have significant potential in biomedical electronics and bionic robotic engineering. However, it is challenging to acquire this type of organic devices considering the thermal instability of conventional organic materials and the degradation of photoresponse mechanisms at high temperatures. Here, high&#8208;temperature synaptic phototransistors (HTSPs) based on thermally stable semiconductor polymer blends as the photosensitive layer are developed, successfully simulating fundamental optical&#8208;modulated synaptic characteristics at a wide operating temperature range from room temperature to 220&#176;C. Robust optoelectronic performance can be observed in HTSPs even after experiencing 750 hours of the double 85 testing due to the enhanced operational reliability. Using HTSPs, Morse&#8208;code optical decoding scheme and the visual object recognition capability are also verified at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, flexible HTSPs are fabricated, demonstrating an ultralow power consumption of 12.3 aJ per synaptic event at a low operating voltage of &#8722;0.05&#160;mV. Overall, the conundrum of achieving reliable optical&#8208;modulated neuromorphic applications while balancing low power consumption can be effectively addressed. This research opens up a simple but effective avenue for the development of high&#8208;temperature and energy&#8208;efficient wearable optoelectronic devices in neuromorphic computing applications.

         <title>Efficient Flow Synthesis of Aspirin within 2D Sub&#8208;Nanoconfined Laminar Annealed Graphene Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D sub&#8208;nanoconfined annealed graphene oxide membranes are constructed for efficient synthesis of aspirin in directional flow. The reaction shows &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented short reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Density functional theory calculation indicates the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure plays an important role in the efficient reaction.








Abstract
The aim of this work is to develop an environmentally friendly, safe, and simple route for realizing efficient preparation of aspirin. Here, inspired by enzyme synthesis in vivo, the aspirin synthesis has been realized by sub&#8208;nanoconfined esterification with directional flow and &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Such flow esterification reaction is catalyzed by thermally transformed graphene oxide (GO) membranes with tailored physicochemical properties, which can be obtained simply through a mild annealing method. A possible mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculation, indicating that the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure can significantly improve the catalytic performance. By restricting reactants within 2D sub&#8208;nano space created by GO&#8208;based laminar flow&#8208;reactors, the present strategy provides a new route to achieve rapid flow synthesis of aspirin with nearly complete conversion.

         <title>RuOx Quantum Dots Loaded on Graphdiyne for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The strengthened d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based catalyst (RuOxQDs/GDY) and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is achieved through the strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY for LiPSs conversion. RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable lithium metal anodes. Thus, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur full cells are realized.








Abstract
Here, a strategy to strengthen d&#8211;p orbital hybridization by fabricating &#960; backbonding in the catalyst for efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion is reported. A special interface structure of RuOx quantum dots (QDs) anchored on graphdiyne (GDY) nanoboxes (RuOxQDs/GDY) is prepared to enable strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which effectively regulates the d&#8208;electron structures of Ru centers to promote the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between the catalyst and LiPSs and significantly boosts the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY. The strong affinity with Li ions and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion of RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable Li metal anodes. Thus, S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes exhibit excellent cycling performance under harsh conditions, and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes show an ultralong cycling life over 8800&#160;h without Li dendrite growth. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cells with S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes can deliver an impressive areal capacity of 17.8&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability under the practical conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio (N/P = 1.4), lean electrolyte (E/S = 3&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), and high S mass loading (15.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature, Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Self&#8208;Switching in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conventional switching heterostructures based on spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT), a spin source material with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling or broken inversion symmetry is typically required to generate SOT when a charge current is applied. In this study, we achieved current&#8208;induced self&#8208;switching of magnetization at room temperature using a layered polar magnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2, thereby greatly simplifying the structure for magnetization switching.








Abstract
2D layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as &#160;spin&#160;source layers to realize high&#8208;efficiency magnetic switching. Such low&#8208;symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, the experimental observation of spin&#8211;orbit torque magnetization self&#8208;switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2 is reported. The spin&#8211;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the c&#8208;axis of the crystal. These results provide a direct pathway toward applicable 2D spintronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphases via Anion Choice Enables Stable, Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). By employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB), it is demonstrated that electrolyte anions can improve the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI.








Abstract
The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;it is&#160;demonstrated that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160;methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system are examined. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &gt;1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high&#8208;rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g(LFP)&#8722;1 at C/2 (&#8776;0.991 mAh cm&#8722;2, @ 0.61 mA cm&#8722;2) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.86%).

         <title>Terahertz Liquid Biosensor Based on A Graphene Metasurface for Ultrasensitive Detection with A Quasi&#8208;Bound State in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of metasurface with graphene, which enables liquid detection. The study opens new avenues for the advancement of metasurfaces by establishing them as potent candidates for optical sensors with real&#8208;time and label&#8208;free capabilities.








Abstract
The concept of a quasi&#8208;bound state in a continuum (QBIC) has garnered significant attention in various fields such as sensing, communication, and optical switching. Within metasurfaces, QBICs offer a reliable platform that enables sensing capabilities through potent interactions between local electric fields and matter. Herein, a novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of QBIC with graphene is reported, which enables multidimensional detection. The proposed biosensor is distinctive because of its ability to discern concentrations of ethanol and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone in a wide range from 100% to 0%, by monitoring the changes in the resonance intensity and maximum wavelet coefficient. This approach demonstrates an excellent linear fit, which ensures robust quantitative analysis. The remarkable sensitivity of our biosensor enables it to detect minute changes in low&#8208;concentration solutions, with the lowest detection concentration value (LDCV) of 0.21&#160;pg&#160;mL&#8722;1. 2D wavelet coefficient intensity cards are effectively constructed through continuous wavelet transforms, which presents a more accurate approach for determining the concentration of the solution. Ultimately, the novel sensing platform offers a host of advantages, including heightened sensitivity and reusability. This pioneering approach establishes a new avenue for liquid&#8208;based terahertz biosensing.

         <title>Crystallization Control Based on the Regulation of Solvent&#8211;Perovskite Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Ambient Printable FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak coordination solvent strategy is developed to tailor solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination. This strategy promotes the direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3),&#160;leads to more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics, and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. The corresponding ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%.








Abstract
The critical requirement for ambient&#8208;printed formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) lies in the control of nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. Here, a strategy is developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in situ characterizations, the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is illustrated. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high&#8208;quality void&#8208;free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3.

&lt;p&gt;A weak coordination solvent strategy is developed to tailor solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination. This strategy promotes the direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;-formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&#160;leads to more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics, and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. The corresponding ambient-printed FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical requirement for ambient-printed formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in the control of nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. Here, a strategy is developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in situ characterizations, the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is illustrated. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high-quality void-free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This process exhibits more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. This strategy leads to improved structural and optoelectronic properties within the FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films, characterized by more compact grain stacking, smoother surface morphology, released lattice strain, and fewer defects. The ambient-printed FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of Phase Transition in Cobalt Selenide with Simultaneous Construction of Heterojunctions for Highly&#8208;Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt selenide&#8208;cobalt nitride (CoSe2&#8208;CoN) heterojunction is obtained via a simultaneous phase/interface engineering strategy. Co sites at the CoSe2&#8208;CoN interface serve as the main catalytic centers for optimizing adsorption energies for intermediates. The delocalized electronic state of CoN assists the formation of an electron&#8208;rich state over the CoSe2&#8208;CoN interface, thus lowering energy barriers of rate&#8208;determining steps to promote oxygen&#8208;electrocatalysis activity.








Abstract
Phase transformation of cobalt selenide (CoSe2) can effectively modulate its intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. However, enhancing electroconductivity and catalytic activity/stability of CoSe2 still remains challenging. Heterostructure engineering may be feasible to optimize interfacial properties to promote the kinetics of oxygen electrocatalysis on a CoSe2&#8208;based catalyst. Herein, a heterostructure consisting of CoSe2 and cobalt nitride (CoN) embedded in a hollow carbon cage is designed via a simultaneous phase/interface engineering strategy. Notably, the phase transition of orthorhombic&#8208;CoSe2 to cubic&#8208;CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) accompanied by in situ CoN formation is realized to build the c&#8208;CoSe2/CoN heterointerface, which exhibits excellent/highly stable activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Notably, heterostructure can modulate the local coordination environment and increase Co&#8208;Se/N bond lengths. Theoretical calculations show that Co&#8208;site (c&#8208;CoSe2) with an electronic state near Fermi energy level is the main active site for ORR/OER.Energetical tailoring of the d&#8208;orbital electronic structure of the Co atom of c&#8208;CoSe2 in heterostructure by in situ CoN incorporation lowers thermodynamic barriers for ORR/OER. Attractively, a zinc&#8208;air battery with a c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;CoN cathode displays excellent cycling stability (250&#160;h) and charge/discharge voltage loss (0.953/0.96&#160;V). It highlights that heterointerface engineering provides an option for modulating the bifunctional activity of metal selenides with controlled phase transformation.

         <title>Nanodiamond&#8208;Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of paramagnetic centers in nanodiamonds drives effective reduction in longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and relaxation of neighboring water molecules, resulting in bright appearance on T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance images. , Using in vivo chicken embryos, it is confirmed nanodiamonds can provide high contrast to noise ratio for tracking and cell labeling over periods of time using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).








Abstract
Nanodiamonds (ND) hold great potential for diverse applications due to their biocompatibility, non&#8208;toxicity, and versatile functionalization. Direct visualization of ND by means of non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques will open new venues for labeling and tracking, offering unprecedented and unambiguous detection of labeled cells or nanodiamond&#8208;based drug carrier systems. The structural defects in diamonds, such as vacancies, can have paramagnetic properties and potentially act as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The smallest nanoscale diamond particles, detonation ND, are reported to effectively reduce longitudinal relaxation time T1 and provide signal enhancement in MRI. Using in vivo, chicken embryos, direct visualization of ND is demonstrated as a bright signal with high contrast to noise ratio. At 24 h following intravascular application marked signal enhancement is noticed in the liver and the kidneys, suggesting uptake by the phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and in vivo labeling of these cells. This is confirmed by visualization of nanodiamond&#8208;labeled macrophages as positive (bright) signal, in vitro. Macrophage cell labeling is not associated with significant increase in pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines or marked cytotoxicity. These results indicate nanodiamond as a novel gadolinium&#8208;free contrast&#8208;enhancing agent with potential for cell labeling and tracking and over periods of time.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets Constructed Hierarchical Water Transport Biological Channel for High&#8208;Performance Interfacial Seawater Evaporation</title>

Abstract
Solar interfacial water evaporation shows great potential to address the global freshwater scarcity. As water evaporation is inherently energy intensive, Joule&#8208;heating assisted solar evaporation for addressing the insufficient vapor under natural conditions is an ideal strategy. However, the simultaneous optimisation of low evaporation enthalpy, high photothermal conversion and excellent Joule&#8208;heating steam generation within a single material remains a rare achievement. Herein, inspired by the biological channel structures, we elaboratively design a large&#8208;area film with hierarchical macro/microporous structures by stacking the nanosheet of a conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Ni3(HITP)2, on a paper substrate. By combining the above three features in one material, the water evaporation enthalpy reduces from 2455 J g&#8722;1 to 1676 J g&#8722;1, and the photothermal conversion efficiency increases from 13.75% to 96.25%. Benefiting from the synergistic photothermal and Joule&#8208;heating effects, the evaporation rate achieves 2.60&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun plus input electrical power of 4&#160;W, surpassing the thermodynamic limit and marking the highest reported value in MOF&#8208;based evaporators. Moreover, Ni3(HITP)2&#8208;paper exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability in simulated seawater, where no salt crystallization and evaporation rate degradationare observed. This design strategy for nanosheet films with hierarchical macro/microporous channels provides inspiration for electronics, biological devices, and energy applications.

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge engineering is proposed to improve the permittivity of polymer donors without impairing their miscibility with acceptor materials. Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF)&#8208;based polymer PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz demonstrates larger permittivity, smaller exciton binding energy, and more favorable molecular packing than its counterparts, leading to proficient charge dynamics and a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.10% with a remarkable fill factor of 80.11% for derived devices.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit complex charge dynamics, which are closely correlated with the dielectric constant (&#603;r) of photovoltaic materials. In this work, a series of novel conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF) and benzotriazole (BTz) is designed and synthesized, which differ by the nature of &#960;&#8208;bridge from one another. The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz with asymmetric furan and thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge demonstrates a larger &#603;r of 4.22 than PBDF&#8208;dT&#8208;BTz with symmetric thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.15) and PBDF&#8208;dF&#8208;BTz with symmetric furan &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.90). The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz also offers more favorable molecular packing and appropriate miscibility with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 than its counterparts. The corresponding PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO&#8208;12) as a third component, the PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6:PCBO&#8208;12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF&#8208;polymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to developing high&#8208;permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

In this work, a series of novel conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b&#8242;]difuran (BDF) and benzotriazole (BTz) is designed and synthesized, which differ by the nature of &#960;-bridge from one another. The PBDF-TF-BTz with asymmetric furan and thiophene &#960;-bridge demonstrates a larger &#603;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of 4.22 than PBDF-dT-BTz with symmetric thiophene &#960;-bridge (3.15) and PBDF-dF-BTz with symmetric furan &#960;-bridge (3.90). The PBDF-TF-BTz also offers more favorable molecular packing and appropriate miscibility with non-fullerene acceptor Y6 than its counterparts. The corresponding PBDF-TF-BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO-12) as a third component, the PBDF-TF-BTz:Y6:PCBO-12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF-polymer-based OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to developing high-permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF-TF-BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high-performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticle Reporters for High&#8208;Precision Urinalysis of in Situ Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The expression of disease&#8208;specific membrane proteins (MPs) is a crucial indicator for evaluating the onset and progression of diseases. Urinalysis of in situ MPs has the potential for point&#8208;of&#8208;care disease diagnostics, yet remains challenging due to the lack of molecular reporter to transform the expression information of in situ MPs into the measurable urine composition. Herein, a series of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) are employed as the cores of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (PANs) to direct the self&#8208;assembly of PAN reporters with defined ligand valence and spatial distribution. With the rational spatial organization of ligands, the interaction between PAN reporters and MPs exhibits superior stability on cell&#8208;membrane interface under renal tubule&#8208;mimic fluid microenvironment, thus enabling high&#8208;fidelity conversion of MPs expression level into binding events and reverse assessment of in situ MP levels via measurement of the renal clearance efficiency of PAN reporters. Such PAN reporter&#8208;mediated signal transformation mechanism empowers urinalysis of the onset of acute kidney injury at least 6&#8201;h earlier than the existing methods with an area under the curve of 100%. This strategy has the potential for urinalysis of a variety of in situ membrane proteins.

         <title>Endogenous Zinc Ion&#8208;Triggered In&#8208;Situ Gelation Enables Zn Capture to Reprogramme Benign Hyperplastic Prostate Microenvironment and Shrink Prostate</title>

Abstract
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as the leading cause of urination disorder is still a refractory disease, and there have no satisfied drugs or treatment protocols yet. With identifying excessive Zn2+, inflammation, and oxidative stress as the etiology of aberrant hyperplasia, an injectable sodium alginate (SA) &amp; glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;interconnected hydrogels (SAGA) featuring Zn2+&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ gelation have been developed to load lonidamine for reprogramming prostate microenvironment and treating BPH. Herein, SAGA hydrogels can crosslink with Zn2+ in BPH via coordination chelation and switch free Zn2+ to bound ones, consequently alleviating Zn2+&#8208;arised inflammation and glycolysis. Beyond capturing Zn2+, GA with intrinsic immunoregulatory property can also alleviate local inflammation and scavenge ROS. Intriguingly, Zn2+ chelation&#8208;bridged interconnection in SAGA enhances its mechanical property and regulates the degradation rate to enable continuous lonidamine release, favoring hyperplastic acini apoptosis and further inhibiting glycolysis. These multiple actions cooperatively reprogramme BPH microenvironment to alleviate characteristic symptoms of BPH and shrink prostate. RNA sequencing reveals that chemotaxis, glycolysis and TNF inflammation&#8208;related pathways associated with M1&#8208;like phenotype polarization are discerned as the action rationales of such endogenous Zn2+&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ hydrogels, providing a candidate avenue to treat BPH.

         <title>Recent advances in hybrid seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Seawater electrolysis (SWE) is a promising and potentially cost&#8208;effective approach to hydrogen production, considering that seawater is vastly abundant and SWE is able to combine with offshore renewables producing green hydrogen that can be readily shipped by sea to end users. However, SWE has long been suffering from technical challenges including mainly the high energy demand and the interference of chlorine chemistry, leading electrolyzers to a low efficiency and short lifespan. In this context, hybrid SWE, operated by substituting the energy&#8208;demanding OER and interfering chlorine evolution reaction (CER) with a thermodynamically more favorable anodic oxidation reaction (AOR) or by designing innovative electrolyzer cells, has recently emerged as a better alternative, which not only allows SWE to occur in a safe and energy&#8208;saving manner without the notorious CER, but also enables co&#8208;production of value&#8208;added chemicals or elimination of environmental pollutants. This review provides a first account of recent advances in hybrid SWE for hydrogen production. The substitutional AOR of various small molecules or redox mediators, in couple with hydrogen evolution from seawater, is comprehensively summarized. Moreover, how the electrolyzer cell design helps in hybrid SWE is briefly discussed. Lastly, the current challenges and future outlook about the development of the hybrid SWE technology are outlined

         <title>Non&#8208;epitaxial Wafer&#8208;Scale Single&#8208;Crystal 2d Materials on Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Next&#8208;generation nanodevices require two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material synthesis on insulating substrates. However, growing high&#8208;quality 2D layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene, on insulators is challenging owing to the lack of suitable metal catalysts, imperfect lattice matching with substrates, and other factors. Therefore, developing a generally applicable approach for realizing high&#8208;quality 2D layers on insulators remains crucial, despite numerous strategies having been explored. Herein, we introduce a universal strategy for the non&#8208;epitaxial synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates. The metal foil in a non&#8208;adhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high&#8208;temperature treatment, thereby pressing the 2D layers to well&#8208;attach onto the insulators. High&#8208;quality, large&#8208;area, single&#8208;crystal, monolayer hBN and graphene films are synthesized on various insulating substrates. This strategy provides new pathways for synthesizing various 2D materials on arbitrary insulators and offers a universal epitaxial platform for future single&#8208;crystal membrane production.

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Targeting Mesenchymal Stem Cells Combined with Photothermal Treatment Attenuate Severe Joint Inflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current clinical therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of osteo&#8208; and rheumatoid&#8208;arthritis is obviously limited. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as a source of promising regenerative therapy, un&#8208;modified MSCs or genetically engineered MSCs injected in vivo restrict their clinical utility because of the low drug efficacy and unpredicted side effect, respectively. Herein, a strategy to enhance the migration efficacy of MSCs to inflamed joints via an inflammation&#8208;mediated education process was demonstrated. To reinforce the limited anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of MSCs, gold nano&#8208;star loaded with triamcinolone are conjugated to MSC. Furthermore, near&#8208;infrared laser&#8208;assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) induced by gold nano&#8208;star significantly elevate the anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy of the developed drugs, even in advanced stage arthritis model. An immunological regulation mechanism study of PTT is first suggested in this study; the expression of the interleukin 22 receptor, implicated in the pathogenesis of arthritis, was downregulated in T lymphocytes by PTT, and Th17 differentiation from na&#239;ve CD4 T cell was inhibited. Collectively, inflammation&#8208;targeting MSCs conjugated with triamcinolone&#8208;loaded gold nano&#8208;star promote the repolarization of macrophages and decrease neutrophil recruitment in joints. In addition, Edu&#8208;MSCs&#8208;AuS&#8208;TA significantly alleviate arthritis&#8208;associated pain and improve general locomotor activity, and more importantly, induced cartilage regeneration even for severe stages of arthritis model.

Abstract
Peptide self&#8208;assembly is a powerful tool to prepare functional materials at the nanoscale. Often, the resulting materials have high aspect&#8208;ratio, with intermolecular &#946;&#8208;sheet formation underlying one&#8208;dimensional fibrillar structures. Inspired by dynamic structures in nature, peptide self&#8208;assembly is increasingly moving toward stimuli&#8208;responsive designs wherein assembled structures are formed, altered, or dissipated in response to a specific cue. Herein, a peptide bearing a prosthetic glucose&#8208;binding phenylboronic acid (PBA) is demonstrated to self&#8208;assemble into an uncommon nanocoil morphology. These nanocoils arise from antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets, with molecules aligned parallel to the long axis of the coil. The binding of glucose to the PBA motif stabilizes and elongates the nanocoil, driving entanglement and gelation at physiological glucose levels. The glucose&#8208;dependent gelation of these materials is then explored for the encapsulation and release of a therapeutic agent, glucagon, that corrects low blood glucose levels. Accordingly, the release of glucagon from the nanocoil hydrogels is inversely related to glucose level. When evaluated in a mouse model of severe acute hypoglycemia, glucagon delivered from glucose&#8208;stabilized nanocoil hydrogels demonstrate increased protection compared to delivery of the agent alone or within a control nanocoil hydrogel that is not stabilized by glucose.

Abstract
The narrow electrochemical stability window, deleterious side reactions, and zinc dendrite growth all act to prevent the practical use of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, aqueous &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolytes (synergistic electrolyte&#8208;insulator dispersions) with multiple functions have been developed for achieving high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8208;ion batteries. We reveal how these electrolytes bring a unique combination of benefits, synergizing the advantages of solid and liquid electrolytes. The oxide additions adsorb water molecules and trap anions, causing a network of space charge layers with increased Zn2+ transference number and reduced interfacial resistance. They beneficially modify the hydrogen bond network and the solvation of Zn2+, thereby influencing the mechanical and electrochemical properties, and causing the Mn2+ in the solution to be oxidized and thus providing additional capacity. As a result, the best performing Al2O3&#8208;based &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolyte exhibits a long&#8208;life of 2500&#160;h and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior in Zn||Zn cells. Furthermore, it increases the charging cut&#8208;off voltage for Zn/MnO2 full cells to 2&#160;V (versus Zn2+/Zn), allowing for an extremely high specific capacity of 344 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 to be attained. Even under practical conditions with a high mass loading of 10 mgMnO2 cm&#8722;2, it yields a promising specific capacity of 189 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles. The concept of &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; chemistry thus provides a new approach for the design of powerful and universal electrolyte for aqueous batteries.

         <title>Switchable Chemical&#8208;Bond Reorganization for the Stable Charge Trapping in Amorphous Silicon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors suggest a novel atomistic mechanism for stable charge storage in amorphous silicon nitride in charge trap flash memory. Through ab initio molecular dynamics and orbital interaction analysis, it is demonstrated that stable charge trapping involves chemical bond reorganization and large trap level shifts, resulting in charges being trapped in multicenter bonding states.








Abstract
Despite the widespread use of charge&#8208;trap flash (CTF) memory, the atomistic mechanism behind the exceptionally stable charge storage at the localized trap sites is still controversial. Herein, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and orbital interaction analysis, a charge&#8208;dependent switchable chemical&#8208;bond reorganization is elucidated as the underpinning chemistry in the working mechanism of CTF. Especially, positively charged fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen (dubbed N+ center), unappreciated until now, is the decisive component of the entire process; once an electron occupies this site, the N+ center disappears by breaking one N&#9472;Si bond, simultaneously forming a new Si&#9472;Si bond with a nearby Si atom which, in turn, creates fivefold coordinated Si. As a result, the electron is stored in a multi&#8208;center orbital belonging to multiple atoms including the newly formed Si&#9472;Si bond. It is also observed that hole trapping accompanies the creation of an N+ center by forming a new N&#9472;Si bond, which represents the reverse process. To further support and validate this model by means of core&#8208;level calculations, it is also shown that an N+ center's 1s core level is 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;eV deeper in energy than those of the threefold coordinated N atoms, in harmony with experimental X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data.

Inspired by the poison dart frog's skin with venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injects into the silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SLIPS)&#8212;the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS) for neritic marine antifouling.








Abstract
Slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have received widespread attention in the antifouling field. However, the reduction in antifouling performance caused by lubricant loss limits their application in marine antifouling. Herein, inspired by the skin of a poison dart frog which contains venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injected into a silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of SLIPS for marine antifouling applications: the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS). The SPIPS consists of a responsive antifoulant&#8208;releasing switch between &#8220;defensive&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; antifouling modes to intelligently enhance the antifouling effect after lubricant loss. The SPIPS can adjust antifouling performance to meet the antifouling requirements under different light conditions. The wastage of antifoulants is reduced, thereby effectively maintaining the durability and service life of SLIPS materials. The SPIPS exhibits efficient lubricant self&#8208;replenishment, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;protein, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;algal, and self&#8208;healing (97.48%) properties. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory 360&#8208;day antifouling performance in actual marine fields during boom seasons, demonstrating the longest antifouling lifespan in the field tests of reported SLIPS coatings. Hence, the SPIPS can effectively promote the development of SLIPS for neritic antifouling.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Modulating CaCO3&#8208;Based Colloidosomal Microreactors Can Generally Reinforce Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment (TME) modulating CaCO3&#8208;based colloidosomal microreactors are constructed via encapulating catalase within CaCO3 nanoparticles assembled colloidsome. The obtained CCaP CSs can simultaneously neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and deplete immunosuppressive lactate, collectively leading to activated anticancer immunity. As a result, CCaP CSs treatment can remarkably reinforce the therapeutic potency of both anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 immunotherapy and EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapy in different tumor models.








Abstract
Tumor hypoxia and acidity, two general features of solid tumors, are known to have negative effect on cancer immunotherapy by directly causing dysfunction of effector immune cells and promoting suppressive immune cells inside tumors. Herein, a multifunctional colloidosomal microreactor is constructed by encapsulating catalase within calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle&#8208;assembled colloidosomes (abbreviated as CaP CSs) via the classic double emulsion method. The yielded CCaP CSs exhibit well&#8208;retained proton&#8208;scavenging and hydrogen peroxide decomposition performances and can thus neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and suppress lactate production upon intratumoral administration. Consequently, CCaP CSs treatment can activate potent antitumor immunity and thus significantly enhance the therapeutic potency of coloaded anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) antibodies in both murine subcutaneous CT26 and orthotopic 4T1 tumor xenografts. In addition, such CCaP CSs treatment also markedly reinforces the therapeutic potency of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing chimeric antigen receptor T (EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T) cells toward a human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer xenograft by promoting their tumor infiltration and effector cytokine secretion. Therefore, this study highlights that chemical modulation of tumor acidity and hypoxia can collectively reverse tumor immunosuppression and thus significantly potentiate both immune checkpoint blockade and CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapies toward solid tumors.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Electron Synchronization Excitation for Photochemical Synthesis and Patterning Graphene&#8208;Based Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel approach for synthesizing and patterning electrodes using multi&#8208;point electron synchronization excitation. It not only significantly enhances the processing efficiency for micro&#8208;supercapacitors but also circumvents the influence of electrode morphology during the traditional laser direct writing. This strategy leads to enhanced electrochemical performance&#160;and better processing efficiency and quality of micro&#8208;supercapacitors.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) represent a pressing requirement for powering the forthcoming generation of micro&#8208;electronic devices. The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of electrode materials and precision patterning for MSCs in a single step presents an ardent need, yet it poses a formidable challenge. Herein, a unique shaped laser&#8208;induced patterned electron synchronization excitation strategy has been put forward to photochemical synthesis RuO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode and simultaneously manufacture the micron&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MSCs with ultra&#8208;high resolution. Significantly, the technique represents a noteworthy advancement over traditional laser direct writing (LDW) patterning and photoinduced synthetic electrode methods. It not only improves the processing efficiency for MSCs and the controllability of laser&#8208;induced electrode material but also enhances electric fields and potentials at the interface for better electrochemical performance. The resultant MSCs exhibit excellent area and volumetric capacitance (516&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1720&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3), and ultrahigh energy density (0.41&#160;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;3) and well&#8208;cycle stability (retaining 95% capacitance after 12000 cycles). This investigation establishes a novel avenue for electrode design and underscores substantial potential in the fabrication of diverse microelectronic devices.

         <title>Molecular Masking of Synthetic Immunomodulator Evokes Antitumor Immunity With Reduced Immune Tolerance and Systemic Toxicity by Temporal Activity Recovery and Sustained Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical application of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist (TLR7/8a)&#160;therapy is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal activity recovery&#160;of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposomes (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) in a macroscale depot is designed.








Abstract
Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor&#8208;induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule&#8208;based toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) (NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot are designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggers robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells into tumor&#8208;suppressive cells, with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 plus anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) or nanoliposomes (Doxorubicin) has synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro&#8208;TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Neutrophil Function Conversion Driven by Immune Switchpoint Regulator against Diabetes&#8208;Related Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, tailored to the immune properties of diabetes&#8208;related biofilm infections (DRBIs), an immune switchpoint regulator, DNase&#8208;I@V2C, is cleverly constructed. By virtue of the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activities and physical characteristics, DNase&#8208;I@V2C effectively drives the conversion of neutrophil functions from NETosis to phagocytosis in diabetic microenvironment, leading to complete biofilm clearance. It is expected to provide a viable approach to treat DRBIs.








Abstract
Reinforced biofilm structures and dysfunctional neutrophils induced by excessive oxidative stress contribute to the refractoriness of diabetes&#8208;related biofilm infections (DRBIs). Herein, in contrast to traditional antibacterial therapies, an immune switchpoint&#8208;driven neutrophil immune function conversion strategy based on a deoxyribonuclease I loaded vanadium carbide MXene (DNase&#8208;I@V2C) nanoregulator is proposed to treat DRBIs via biofilm lysis and redirecting neutrophil functions from NETosis to phagocytosis in diabetes. Owing to its intrinsic superoxide dismutase/catalase&#8208;like activities, DNase&#8208;I@V2C effectively scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a high oxidative stress microenvironment to maintain the biological activity of DNase&#8208;I. By increasing the depth of biofilm penetration of DNase&#8208;I, DNase&#8208;I@V2C thoroughly degrades extracellular DNA and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in extracellular polymeric substances, thus breaking the physical barrier of biofilms. More importantly, as an immune switchpoint regulator, DNase&#8208;I@V2C can skew neutrophil functions from NETosis toward phagocytosis by intercepting ROS&#8211;NE/MPO&#8211;PAD4 and activating ROS&#8211;PI3K&#8211;AKT&#8211;mTOR pathways in diabetic microenvironment, thereby eliminating biofilm infections. Biofilm lysis and synergistic neutrophil function conversion exert favorable therapeutic effects on biofilm infections in vitro and in vivo. This study serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration of effectively achieving DRBIs with high therapeutic efficacy by regulating immune switchpoint to reverse neutrophil functions.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Macrophage&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Targeted Photothermal Therapy and Virus Transmission Blockage in Monkeypox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise therapeutic, prevention, and control strategy for monkeypox, based on an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) loaded macrophage&#8208;like biomimetic nanoparticle (TBD@M NPs), is developed. TBD@M NPs achieve NIR&#8208;II fluorescent tracking of the monkeypox lesions and photothermal eradication of monkeypox virus after intravenous injection followed by 808&#160;nm laser stimulation, thus accomplishing monkeypox treatment, wound healing promoting, and virus transmission blockage.








Abstract
The recent prevalence of monkeypox has led to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Monkeypox lesions are typically ulcers or pustules (containing high titers of replication&#8208;competent virus) in the skin and mucous membranes, which allow monkeypox virus to transmit predominantly through intimate contact. Currently, effective clinical treatments for monkeypox are lacking, and strategies for blocking virus transmission are fraught with drawbacks. Herein, this work constructs a biomimetic nanotemplate (termed TBD@M NPs) with macrophage membranes as the coat and polymeric nanoparticles loading a versatile aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured photothermal molecule TPE&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ as the core. In a surrogate mouse model of monkeypox (vaccinia&#8208;virus&#8208;infected tail scarification model), intravenously injected TBD@M NPs show precise tracking and near&#8208;infrared region II fluorescence imaging of the lesions. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the virus is eliminated by the photothermal effect and the infected wound heals rapidly. More importantly, the inoculation of treated lesion tissue suspensions does not trigger tail infection or inflammatory activation in healthy mice, indicating successful blockage of virus transmission. This study demonstrates for the first time monkeypox theranostics using nanomedicine, and may bring a new insight into the development of a viable strategy for monkeypox management in clinical trials.

         <title>Design of High&#8208;Entropy Tape Electrolytes for Compression&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

An advanced tape electrolyte is realized by harnessing high&#8208;entropy condensed microstructures of polymers. The high&#8208;entropy tape electrolyte brings a promising solution to not only the challenging interface issues in solid&#8208;state batteries, but also future flexible energy storage devices.








Abstract
Advanced solid electrolytes with strong adhesion to other components are the key for the successes of solid&#8208;state batteries. Unfortunately, traditional solid electrolytes have to work under high compression to maintain the contact inside owing to their poor adhesion. Here, a concept of high&#8208;entropy tape electrolyte (HETE) is proposed to simultaneously achieve tape&#8208;like adhesion, liquid&#8208;like ion conduction, and separator&#8208;like mechanical properties. This HETE is designed with adhesive skin layer on both sides and robust skeleton layer in the middle. The significant properties of the three layers are enabled by high&#8208;entropy microstructures which are realized by harnessing polymer&#8211;ion interactions. As a result, the HETE shows high ionic conductivity (3.50 &#177; 0.53 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), good mechanical properties (toughness 11.28 &#177; 1.12&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, strength 8.18 &#177; 0.28&#160;MPa), and importantly, tape&#8208;like adhesion (interfacial toughness 231.6 &#177; 9.6 J m&#8722;2). Moreover, a compression&#8208;free solid&#8208;state tape battery is finally demonstrated by adhesion&#8208;based assembling, which shows good interfacial and electrochemical stability even under harsh mechanical conditions, such as twisting and bending. The concept of HETE and compression&#8208;free solid&#8208;state tape batteries may bring promising solutions and inspiration to conquer the interface challenges in solid&#8208;state batteries and their manufacturing.

         <title>Rejoint of Carbon Nitride Fragments into Multi&#8208;Interfacial Order&#8208;Disorder Homojunction for Robust Photo&#8208;Driven Generation of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a directed healing process is employed to splice carbon nitride pieces into a carbon nitride homojunction with multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces. The resultant catalyst exhibits boosted charge dynamics and more spatially and orderly separated redox centers, resulting in a remarkable yield, an excellent selectivity, and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency in photosynthesis of H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic technology based on carbon nitride (C3N4) offers a sustainable and clean approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but the yield is severely limited by the sluggish hot carriers due to the weak internal electric field. In this study, a novel approach is devised by fragmenting bulk C3N4&#160;into smaller pieces (CN&#8208;NH4) and then subjecting it to a directed healing process to create multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces (CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK).&#160;The resulting junctions in CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK significantly boost charge dynamics and facilitate more spatially and orderly separated redox centers. As a result, CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK demonstrates outstanding photosynthesis of H2O2 via both two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron and one&#8208;step double&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathways, achieving a remarkable yield of 16675&#160;&#181;mol h&#8211;1&#160;g&#8211;1, excellent selectivity (&gt;&#160;91%), and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 2.3%. These remarkable results surpass pristine C3N4 by 158 times and outperform previously reported C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work represents a significant advancement in catalyst design and modification technology, inspiring the development of more efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for the synthesis of highly valued fuels.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Wearable Organic Photodetectors by Molecular Design and Green Solvent Processing for Pulse Oximetry and Photoplethysmography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photodetectors processed from a biomass&#8208;derived solvent, namely 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, which simultaneously exhibits a remarkably high detectivity and surpasses the performances of devices processed from conventional chlorinated solvents, are developed. Furthermore, such devices can also be used as smart wearable devices for medical applications, such as heart pulse rate monitoring and blood oxygen saturation assessment.








Abstract
White&#8208;light detection from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared region is central to many applications such as high&#8208;speed cameras, autonomous vehicles, and wearable electronics. While organic photodetectors (OPDs) are being developed for such applications, several challenges must be overcome to produce scalable high&#8208;detectivity OPDs. This includes issues associated with low responsivity, narrow absorption range, and environmentally friendly device fabrication. Here, an OPD system processed from 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) sets a record in light detectivity, which is also comparable with commercially available silicon&#8208;based photodiodes is reported. The newly designed OPD is employed in wearable devices to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation using a flexible OPD&#8208;based finger pulse oximeter. In achieving this, a framework for a detailed understanding of the structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship in these OPDs is also developed. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films processed from 2&#8208;MeTHF are characterized at different length scales with advanced techniques. The BHJ morphology exhibits optimal intermixing and phase separation of donor and acceptor moieties, which facilitates the charge generation and collection process. Benefitting from high charge carrier mobilities and a low shunt leakage current, the newly developed OPD exhibits a specific detectivity of above 1012&#160;Jones over 400&#8211;900&#160;nm, which is higher than those of reference devices processed from chlorobenzene and&#160;ortho&#8208;xylene.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Responsive Sliver Peroxide&#8208;Nanocarrier Serves as Broad&#8208;spectrum Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase Inhibitor for Combating Severe Pneumonia</title>

Abstract
Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases (MBLs) represent a prevalent resistance mechanism in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, rendering last&#8208;line carbapenem&#8208;related antibiotics ineffective. Here, a bio&#8208;responsive sliver peroxide (Ag2O2)&#8208;based nanovesicle, named Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM, was developed as a broad&#8208;spectrum MBL inhibitor for combating MBL&#8208;producing bacterial pneumonia. Ag2O2 nanoparticle was first orderly modified with bovine serum albumin and polydopamine to co&#8208;load meropenem (MER) and [5&#8208;(p&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;ureido]&#8208;thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide (TPCA&#8208;1) and then encapsulated with macrophage membrane (MM) aimed to target inflammatory lung tissue specifically. The resultant Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM effectively abrogated MBL activity by displacing the Zn2+ cofactor with Ag+ in MBLs and displayed potent bactericidal and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, specific targeting abilities, and great bio&#8208;responsive characteristics. After intravenous injection, the nanoparticles accumulated prominently at infection sites through MM&#8208;mediated targeting and acid&#8208;responsive drug release. Ag+ released from Ag2O2 decomposition at the infection sites effectively inhibited MBL activity and overcame the resistance of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria to MER, resulting in synergistic elimination of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria in conjunction with MER. In two murine infection models of NDM&#8208;1+ Klebsiella pneumoniae&#8208;induced severe pneumonia and NDM&#8208;1+ Escherichia coli&#8208;induced sepsis&#8208;related bacterial pneumonia, the nanoparticles significantly reduced bacterial loading, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels locally and systemically, and the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages. The modality also protected the lungs from severe injury. This innovative approach presents a promising new strategy for combating infections caused by MBL&#8208;producing carbapenem&#8208;resistant bacteria.

         <title>Intelligent Size&#8208;Switchable Iron Carbide&#8208;Based Nanocapsules with Cascade Delivery Capacity for Hyperthermia&#8208;Enhanced Deep Tumor Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.

The ferroptosis pathway is recognized as an essential strategy for tumor treatment. However, killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. Herein, intelligent nanocapsules with size&#8208;switchable capability that responds to acid/hyperthermia stimulation to achieve deep tumor ferroptosis are developed. These nanocapsules are constructed using poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid and Pluronic F127 as carrier materials, with Au&#8211;Fe2C Janus nanoparticles serving as photothermal and ferroptosis agents, and sorafenib (SRF) as the ferroptosis enhancer. The PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules, designed with an appropriate size, exhibit superior intratumoral accumulation compared to free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles, as evidenced by photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. These nanocapsules can degrade within the acidic tumor microenvironment when subjected to laser irradiation, releasing free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles. This enables them to penetrate deep into tumor regions and disrupt intracellular redox balance. Under the guidance of imaging, these PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules effectively inhibit tumor growth when exposed to laser irradiation, capitalizing on the synergistic photothermal and ferroptosis effects. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescence Imaging of Chemotherapy&#8208;Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly bright near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophore is synthesized and developed into a water&#8208;soluble activatable probe (CalCL) for in vivo imaging of drug&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy.








Abstract
Chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has a high prevalence but is poorly managed for cancer patients due to the lack of reliable and sensitive diagnostic techniques. Molecular optical imaging can provide a noninvasive way for real&#8208;time monitoring of CIPN; However, this is not reported, likely due to the absence of optical probes capable of imaging deep into the spinal canal and possessing sufficient sensitivity for minimal dosage through local injection into the dorsal root ganglia. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophore (MPBD) with a chemiluminescence quantum yield higher than other reported probes is synthesized and a NIR activatable chemiluminescent probe (CalCL) is developed for in vivo imaging of CIPN. CalCL is constructed by caging MPBD with calpain&#8208;cleavable peptide moiety while conjugating polyethylene glycol chain to endow water solubility. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue penetration of chemiluminescence and specific turn&#8208;on response of CalCL toward calpain (a hallmark of CIPN), it allows for sensitive detection of paclitaxel&#8208;mediated CIPN in living mice, which is unattainable by fluorescence imaging. This study thus not only develops a highly efficient chemiluminescent probe, but also presents the first optical imaging approach toward high&#8208;throughput screening of neurotoxic drugs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Black Barium Titanate for Multienzyme&#8208;Piezoelectric Synergetic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich black barium titanate nanoparticles for amplified piezocatalytic tumor therapy based on the narrowing of the bandgap and the suppression of carrier recombination processes through the introduction of the Pd component.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic tumor therapy is an emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generating therapeutic approach that relies on piezoelectric polarization under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Optimizing ROS production is a primary objective for enhancing treatment efficiency. In this study, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Pd&#8208;integrated black barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles are rationally engineered to boost the ROS generation efficiency via the introduction of Pd. Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation at low temperatures narrows the bandgap of BTO and reduces the recombination rate of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Furthermore, Pd has dual&#8208;enzyme&#8208;mimicking characteristics, including peroxidase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which further heighten the therapeutic efficacy by enhancing ROS production and reversing the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the dual enzymatic activity of Pd can be amplified by multiple redox processes sparked by the piezoelectric potential under US stimulation, resulting in bilaterally enhanced multienzyme&#8208;piezoelectric synergetic therapy. In vitro and in vivo results confirm high tumor inhibition in murine breast cancer cells. This work stresses the critical effects of defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezodynamic tumor therapy.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair through Multihierarchy Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Regulated Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multihierarchy reactive oxygen species regulated system, PEGS&#8208;PGA/SeSe/Rapa hydrogel (PSeR) for aged bone regeneration can effectively delay senescence and restore the regenerative function of senescent BMSCs by maintaining the levels of ROS intracellularly and extracellularly. Additionally, the PSeR hydrogel can be injected and rapidly crosslinked in the site of bone defects, presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing age&#8208;related bone injuries.








Abstract
Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration is developed by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2)/poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) hydrogel containing rapamycin&#8208;loaded poly(diselenide&#8208;carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibits highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically releases drug&#8208;loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tunes the antioxidant function and delays senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self&#8208;renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this multihierarchy ROS&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for treating degenerative diseases.

         <title>Ultrastrong and High&#8208;Tough Thermoset Epoxy Resins from Hyperbranched Topological Structure and Subnanoscaled Free Volume</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the preparation of high&#8208;performance epoxy thermosets from hyperbranched epoxy, overcoming the two conflicts between strength and toughness and between high performance and highly efficient degradation. The in&#8208;situ simultaneous reinforcing and toughening mechanism is well investigated, being attributed to a synergistic effect of high crosslinking density, minimization of free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and hyperbranched structure.








Abstract
The strength and toughness of thermoset epoxy resins are generally mutually exclusive, as are the high performance and rapid recyclability. Experimentally determined mechanical strength values are usually much lower than their theoretical values. The preparation of thermoset epoxy resins with high modulus, high toughness, ultrastrong strength, and highly efficient recyclability is still a challenge. Here, novel hyperbranched epoxy resins (Bn, n = 6, 12, 24)&#160;with imide structures by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. Bn shows an excellent comprehensive function in simultaneously improving the strength, modulus, toughness, low&#8208;temperature resistance, and degradability of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol&#8208;A (DGEBA). All the mechanical properties first increase and then decrease with minimization of the free volume properties. The improvement is attributable to uniform molecular holes or free volume by a molecular mixture of linear and hyperbranched topological structures. The precise measurement and controllability of the molecular free volume properties of epoxy resins is first discovered, as well as the imide structure degradation of crosslinked epoxy resins. The two conflicts are successfully resolved between strength and toughness and between high performance during service and high efficiency during degradation. These findings provide a route for designing ultrastrong, tough, and recyclable thermoset epoxy resins.

A 3D porous Al current collector decorated with N&#8208;doped graphene affording electronic structure modulation, giving rise to an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI architecture to expedite ion transport and guide dendrite&#8208;free potassium deposition.








Abstract
Potassium metal battery is an appealing candidate for future energy storage. However, its application is plagued by the notorious dendrite proliferation at the anode side, which entails the formation of vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and non&#8208;uniform potassium deposition on the current collector. Here, this work reports a dual&#8208;modification design of aluminum current collector to render dendrite&#8208;free potassium anodes with favorable reversibility. This work achieves to modulate the electronic structure of the designed current collector and accordingly attain an SEI architecture with robust inorganic&#8208;rich constituents, which is evidenced by detailed cryo&#8208;EM inspection and X&#8208;ray depth profiling. The thus&#8208;produced SEI manages to expedite ionic conductivity and guide homogeneous potassium deposition. Compared to the potassium metal cells assembled using typical aluminum current collector, cells based on the designed current collector realize improved rate capability (maintaining 400&#160;h under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low&#8208;temperature durability (stable operation at &#8722;50 &#176;C). Moreover, scalable production of the current collector allows for the sustainable construction of high&#8208;safety potassium metal batteries, with the potential for reducing the manufacturing cost.

         <title>Sweet but Challenging: Tackling the Complexity of GAGs with Engineered Tailor&#8208;Made Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of biomaterials presenting glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is an emerging field. Some of these biomaterials are applied for regenerative medicine but in vivo GAGs are highly diverse. Here, the methods employed to understand the complexity of GAGs are reviewed. High&#8208;throughput methods are focused on comparing multiple parameters in the same experiment.








Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis by regulating the activity and diffusion of bioactive molecules. Incorporating GAGs into biomaterials has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in medical applications, owing to their biocompatibility and ability to control the release of bioactive molecules. Nevertheless, immobilized GAGs on biomaterials can elicit distinct cellular responses compared to their soluble forms, underscoring the need to understand the interactions between GAG and bioactive molecules within engineered functional biomaterials. By controlling critical parameters such as GAG type, density, and sulfation, it becomes possible to precisely delineate GAG functions within a biomaterial context and to better mimic specific tissue properties, enabling tailored design of GAG&#8208;based biomaterials for specific medical applications. However, this requires access to pure and well&#8208;characterized GAG compounds, which remains challenging. This review focuses on different strategies for producing well&#8208;defined GAGs and explores high&#8208;throughput approaches employed to investigate GAG&#8211;growth factor interactions and to quantify cellular responses on GAG&#8208;based biomaterials. These automated methods hold considerable promise for improving the understanding of the diverse functions of GAGs. In perspective, the scientific community is encouraged to adopt a rational approach in designing GAG&#8208;based biomaterials, taking into account the in vivo properties of the targeted tissue for medical applications.

         <title>Specific Propyne Trapping Sites within a Robust MOF for Efficient Propyne/Propadiene Separation with Record Propadiene Productivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust metal organic framework CuZrF6&#8208;TPA with specific propyne trapping sites and multiple supramolecular interactions is reported for benchmark propyne/propadiene separation with record productivity of pure propadiene (4.7 mol L&#8722;1).








Abstract
Separating propyne/propadiene to produce pure propadiene is extremely challenging in industry due to their similar properties. Herein, a novel ZrF62&#8722; anion pillared cage&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (termed as CuZrF6&#8208;TPA) for highly efficient propyne/propadiene separation is reported. It exhibits high propyne capacity (177.4/188.6 cm3/cm3 at 0.5/1.0 bar and 298 K), benchmark separation selectivity (6.0), and remarkable separation potential (5.7 mol L&#8722;1) simultaneously. Record propadiene productivity (&#8776;4.7 mol L&#8722;1) is achieved through a single adsorption process in breakthrough experiments with excellent recycle stability even under humid conditions. Based on the structure of propyne&#8208;loaded single crystals, two binding sites are identified, including a major propyne trapping site at the windows and a minor binding site located in the large cages. Modelling studies further confirm that the contracted cage windows surrounded with rotating Lewis basic F atoms and aromatic rings are the optimal bonding sites to capture propyne with multiple hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Advanced Additive Manufacturing of Structurally&#8208;Colored Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;yield stress colloidal inks for 3D printing of structurally&#8208;colored objects are created through destabilization of ultra&#8208;stable silica suspensions with polar molecules. These inks form dense, uniform colloidal networks and swiftly transition from liquid to solid upon nozzle discharge, facilitating rapid, shrinkage&#8208;free printing. The resulting prints display structural colors and enhanced mechanical properties due to the dense network.








Abstract
Direct ink writing (DIW) stands out as a facile additive manufacturing method, minimizing material waste. Nonetheless, developing homogeneous Bingham inks with high yield stress and swift liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for versatile 3D printing remains a challenge. In this study, high&#8208;performance Bingham inks are formulated by destabilizing silica particle suspensions in acrylate&#8208;based resin. A colloidal network forms in the shear&#8208;free state through interparticle attraction, achieved by disrupting the solvation layer of large resin molecules using polar molecules. The network is highly dense, with evenly distributed linkage strength as monodisperse particles undergo gelation at an ultra&#8208;high fraction. Crucially, the strength is calibrated to ensure a sufficiently large yield stress, while still allowing the network to reversibly melt under shear flow. The inks immediately undergo a liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition upon discharge, while maintaining fluidity without nozzle clogging. The dense colloidal networks develop structural colors due to the short&#8208;range order. This enables the rapid and sophisticated drawing of structurally&#8208;colored 3D structures, relying solely on rheological properties. Moreover, the printed composite structures exhibit high mechanical stability due to the presence of the colloidal network, which expands the range of potential applications.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Adaptable Optothermal Nanotweezers for Trapping, Sorting, and Assembling across Diverse Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly&#8208;adaptable optothermal nanotweezer (HAONT) is a universal optothermal manipulation scheme with sub&#8208;10 nm precision, enabling trapping, sorting, assembling, and novel doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex trapping across diverse nanoparticles. Its versatility expands its functionality to a broad spectrum of nanoparticles, making it a useful tool for versatile nano&#8208;fabrication across various materials, charges, shapes, sizes, and beyond.








Abstract
Optical manipulation of various kinds of nanoparticles is vital in biomedical engineering. However, classical optical approaches demand higher laser power and are constrained by diffraction limits, necessitating tailored trapping schemes for specific nanoparticles. They lack a universal and biocompatible tool to manipulate nanoparticles of diverse sizes, charges, and materials. Through precise modulation of diffusiophoresis and thermo&#8208;osmotic flows in the boundary layer of an optothermal&#8208;responsive gold film, highly adaptable optothermal nanotweezers (HAONTs) capable of manipulating a single nanoparticle as small as sub&#8208;10&#160;nm are designed. Additionally, a novel optothermal doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex (DSV) trapping strategy is introduced, enabling a new mode of physical interaction between cells and nanoparticles. Furthermore, this versatile approach allows for the manipulation of nanoparticles in organic, inorganic, and biological forms. It also offers versatile function modes such as trapping, sorting, and assembling of nanoparticles. It is believed that this approach holds the potential to be a valuable tool in fields such as synthetic biology, optofluidics, nanophotonics, and colloidal science.

         <title>Tunable Hydrogel Electronics for Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) are developed to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation, and enhanced mechanical performance. In clinical applications, the PDEH&#8208;SLM (silver&#8208;liquid metal) devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.








Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy characterized by rapidly increasing numbers of patients is commonly diagnosed via analyzing electromyography signals obtained from stimulation&#8208;recording devices. However, existing commercial electrodes have difficulty in implementing conformal contact with skin and gentle detachment, dramatically impairing stimulation/recording performances. Here, this work develops on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) as stimulation/recording devices to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel achieves rapid and wide&#8208;range regulation of adhesion and substantially strengthened mechanical performances. Moreover, hydrogel patches assembled with a silver&#8208;liquid metal (SLM) layer exhibit superior charge injection and low contact impedance, capable of capturing high&#8208;fidelity electromyography. This work further verifies the feasibility of hydrogel devices for accurate diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy in sensory, motor, and mixed nerves. For various body parts, such as fingers, the elderly's loose skin, hairy skin, and children's fragile skin, this work regulates the adhesion of PDEH&#8208;SLM devices to establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal. Noticeably, hydrogel patches achieve precise diagnoses of nerve injuries in these clinical cases while providing extra advantages of more effective stimulation/recording performances. These patches offer a promising alternative for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropathy in future.

         <title>Reducing Perovskite/C60 Interface Losses via Sequential Interface Engineering for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work implements a sequential interface engineering (SIE) strategy that involves the deposition of ethylenediamine diiodide followed by sequential deposition of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Phenethylammonium chloride on perovskite film. This technique synergistically narrows the conduction band offset and reduces recombination velocity at the perovskite/C60 interface. Based on the SIE strategy, the PCE of 29.6% for a 1&#160;cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem cell is achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells hold tremendous potential for realizing efficient tandem solar cells. However, nonradiative recombination and carrier transport losses occurring at the perovskite/electron&#8208;selective contact (e.g. C60) interface present significant obstacles in approaching their theoretical efficiency limit. To address this, a sequential interface engineering (SIE) strategy that involves the deposition of ethylenediamine diiodide (EDAI2) followed by sequential deposition of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Phenethylammonium chloride (4F&#8208;PEACl) is implemented. The SIE technique synergistically narrows the conduction band offset and reduces recombination velocity at the perovskite/C60 interface. The best&#8208;performing WBG perovskite solar cell (1.67&#160;eV) delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.8% and an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.262&#160;V. Moreover, through integration with double&#8208;textured silicon featuring submicrometer pyramid structures, a stabilized PCE of 29.6% is attained for a 1&#160;cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem cell (certified PCE of 29.0%).

         <title>Deep Learning for Size&#8208;Agnostic Inverse Design of Random&#8208;Network 3D Printed Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical metamaterials are architected engineered materials whose unprecedented properties originate from their designs at the microscale. Here, deep&#8208;learning techniques are utilized to develop a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep&#8208;DRAM&#8221; that generates numerous microstructures for mechanical metamaterials with predefined elastic properties and dimensions for various applications in high&#8208;tech industries, such as soft robotics and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
Practical applications of mechanical metamaterials often involve solving inverse problems aimed at finding microarchitectures that give rise to certain properties. The limited resolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such inverse problems for specific specimen sizes. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be resistant to fatigue and fracture. Such a multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem is formidably difficult to solve but its solution is the key to real&#8208;world applications of mechanical metamaterials. Here, a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep&#8208;DRAM&#8221; that combines four decoupled models is proposed, including two deep learning (DL) models, a deep generative model based on conditional variational autoencoders, and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep&#8208;DRAM integrates these models into a framework capable of finding many solutions to the posed multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem based on random&#8208;network unit cells. Using an extensive set of simulations as well as experiments performed on 3D printed specimens, it is demonstrate that: 1) the predictions of the DL models are in agreement with FE simulations and experimental observations, 2) an enlarged envelope of achievable elastic properties (e.g., rare combinations of double auxeticity and high stiffness) is realized using the proposed approach, and 3) Deep&#8208;DRAM can provide many solutions to the considered multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Metal Foam Catalysts for Cathodic Electro&#8208;Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops leaded foam&#8208;type electrodes through the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) method and tests them in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation for synthesis of fine chemicals. All developed catalysts outperformed both Pb and CuSn7Pb15 in terms of chemical yields and energy efficiency. The latter material is deemed the best replacement for Pb in reductive organo&#8208;electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Although electro&#8208;organic synthesis is currently receiving renewed interest because of its potential to enable sustainability in chemical processes to value&#8208;added products, challenges in process development persist: For reductive transformations performed in protic media, an inherent issue is the limited choice of metallic cathode materials that can effectively suppress the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while maintaining a high activity toward the targeted electro&#8208;organic reaction. Current development trends are aimed at avoiding the previously used HER&#8208;suppressing elements (Cd, Hg, and Pb) because of their toxicity. Here, this work reports the rational design of highly porous foam&#8208;type binary and ternary electrocatalysts with reduced Pb content. Optimized cathodes are tested in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation as a model reaction relevant for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Their electrocatalytic performance is compared with that of the model CuSn7Pb15 bronze alloy that has recently been endorsed as the best cathode replacement for bare Pb electrodes. All developed metal foam catalysts outperform both bare Pb and the CuSn7Pb15 benchmark in terms of chemical yield and energetic efficiency. Moreover, post&#8208;electrolysis analysis of the crude electrolyte mixture and the cathode's surfaces through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, reveal the foam catalysts&#8217; elevated resistance to cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Compact Micropatterned Chip Empowers Undisturbed and Programmable Drug Addition in High&#8208;Throughput Cell Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A miniaturized chip, consisting of a micropatterned and porous polymer film, is presented for light&#8208;induced drug addition in cell&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening. The photoisomerization of atom transfer radical polymerization&#8208;grafted azobenzene enables spatial and temporal control, leveraging digital light processing systems to simultaneously regulate and release integrated cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs in numerous droplets with suspended or adhered cells, undisturbed and programmable.








Abstract
Simultaneously adding multiple drugs and other chemical reagents to individual droplets at specific time points presents a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with tiny droplets in high&#8208;throughput screening applications. In this study, a micropatterned polymer chip is developed as a miniaturized platform for light&#8208;induced programmable drug addition in cell&#8208;based screening. This chip incorporates a porous superhydrophobic polymer film with atom transfer radical polymerization reactivity, facilitating the efficient grafting of azobenzene methacrylate, a photoconformationally changeable group, onto the hydrophilic regions of polymer matrix at targeted locations and with precise densities. By employing light irradiation, the cyclodextrin&#8208;azobenzene host&#8211;guest complexes formed on the polymer chip can switch from an &#8220;associated&#8221; to a &#8220;dissociated&#8221; state, granting precise photochemical control over the supramolecular coding system and its surface patterning ability. Significantly, the exceptional spatial and temporal control offered by these chemical transitions empowers to utilize digital light processing systems for simultaneous regulation and release of cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs across numerous droplets containing suspended or adhered cells. This approach minimizes mechanical disruption while achieving precise control over the timing of addition, dosage, and integration varieties of released drugs in high&#8208;throughput screening, all programmable to meet specific requirements.

This approach minimizes mechanical disruption while achieving precise control over the timing of addition, dosage, and integration varieties of released drugs in high-throughput screening, all programmable to meet specific requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Growth of High&#8208;Quality Single&#8208;Crystal Twisted Bilayer Graphene on Liquid Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth technique for single&#8208;crystal TBG with a wide range of twist angles on liquid copper substrates is reported. The clean surface, high crystallinity, thermal stability, stacking structure, growth mechanism, and electrical transport properties of as&#8208;grown TBG are investigated. This work provides a convenient avenue for investigating the physical properties of TBG.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) generates significant attention in the fundamental research of 2D materials due to its distinct twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent properties. Exploring the efficient production of TBG with a wide range of twist angles stands as one of the major frontiers in moir&#233; materials. Here, the local space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth technique for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal TBG with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176; on liquid copper substrates is reported. The clean surface, pristine interface, high crystallinity, and thermal stability of TBG are verified by using comprehensive characterization techniques including optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. The proportion of TBG in bilayer graphene reaches as high as 89%. In addition, the stacking structure and growth mechanism of TBG are investigated, revealing that the second graphene layer develops beneath the first one. A series of comparative experiments illustrates that the liquid copper surface, with its excellent fluidity, promotes the growth of TBG. Electrical measurements show the twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent electronic properties of as&#8208;grown TBG, achieving a room&#8208;temperature carrier mobility of 26640 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This work provides an approach for the in situ preparation of 2D twisted materials and facilitates the application of TBG in the fields of electronics.

         <title>Industrial Kraft Lignin Based Binary Cathode Interface Layer Enables Enhanced Stability in High Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) in highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy, which can significantly improve the stability of both binary and ternary photoactive layer (PAL) OSC, owing to the passivation of diffusion and reaction between bathocuproine (BCP) and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The results combine sustainable wood&#8208;based material with classic interface materials in advance NFA&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Herein, a binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy based on the industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) is adopted for fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). The uniformly distributed phenol moieties in KL enable it to easily form hydrogen bonds with commonly used CIL materials, i.e., bathocuproine (BCP) and PFN&#8208;Br, resulting in binary CILs with tunable work function (WF). This work shows that the binary CILs work well in OSCs with large KL ratio compatibility, exhibiting equivalent or even higher efficiency to the traditional CILs in state of art OSCs. In addition, the combination of KL and BCP significantly enhanced OSC stability, owing to KL blocking the reaction between BCP and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). This work provides a simple and effective way to achieve high&#8208;efficient OSCs with better stability and sustainability by using wood&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Selectivity Control of CH3OH versus CO/CH4 in CO2 Photoreduction on Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;TiO2/SrTiO3 nanotube arrays are constructed with both Fe single atom reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) for efficiently driving CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation. The amount of water can be facilely adjusted to selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water.








Abstract
Controllable methanol production in artificial photosynthesis is highly desirable due to its high energy density and ease of storage. Herein, single atom Fe is implanted into TiO2/SrTiO3 (TSr) nanotube arrays by two&#8208;step anodization and Sr&#8208;induced crystallization. The resulting Fe&#8208;TSr with both single Fe reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) contributes to efficient CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation for controlled production of CH3OH and CO/CH4. The methanol yield can reach to 154.20&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.90% selectivity by immersing all the catalyst in pure water, and the yield of CO/CH4 is 147.48&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with &gt;99.99% selectivity when the catalyst completely outside water. This CH3OH yield is 50 and 3 times higher than that of TiO2 and TSr and stands among all the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. The facile gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#160;phase switch can selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H2O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH3OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water&#8208;mediated CO2 photoreduction to controllably produce CH3OH.

         <title>Photo&#8208;annealing of Microtissues Creates High&#8208;Density Capillary Network Containing Living Matter in A Volumetric&#8208;Independent Manner.</title>

Abstract
The vascular tree is crucial for the survival and function of large living tissues. Despite breakthroughs in 3D bioprinting to endow engineered tissues with large blood vessels, there is currently no approach to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks into living tissues in a scalable manner. We here present photo&#8208;annealing of living microtissues (PALM) as a scalable strategy to engineer capillary&#8208;rich tissues. Specifically, in&#8208;air microfluidics was used to produce living microtissues composed of cell&#8208;laden microgels in ultra&#8208;high throughput, which could be photo&#8208;annealed into a monolithic living matter. Annealed microtissues inherently give rise to an open and interconnected pore network within the resulting living matter. Interestingly, utilizing soft microgels enables microgel deformation, which leads to the uniform formation of capillary&#8208;sized pores. Importantly, the ultra&#8208;high throughput nature underlying the microtissue formation uniquely facilitates scalable production of living tissues of clinically relevant sizes (&gt;1 cm3) with an integrated high&#8208;density capillary network. In short, PALM generates monolithic, microporous, modular tissues that meet the previously unsolved need for large engineered tissues containing high&#8208;density vascular networks, which is anticipated to advance the fields of engineered organs, regenerative medicine, and drug screening.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Hydrogel Sensors Enabled Multimodal And Accurate Human&#8211;Machine Interaction System for Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Human&#8208;machine interaction (HMI) technology shows an important application prospect in rehabilitation medicine, but it is greatly limited by the unsatisfactory recognition accuracy and wearing comfort. Here, we developed a fully flexible, conformable, and functionalized multimodal HMI interface consisting of hydrogel&#8208;based sensors and a self&#8208;designed flexible printed circuit board. Thanks to the component regulation and structural design of the hydrogel, both electromyogram (EMG) and forcemyography (FMG) signals can be collected accurately and stably, so that they are later decoded with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared with traditional multi&#8208;channel electromyographic (EMG) signals, the multimodal human&#8208;machine interaction method based on the combination of EMG and FMG signals significantly improves the efficiency of human&#8208;machine interaction by increasing the information entropy of the interaction signals. The decoding accuracy of the interaction signals from only two channels for different gestures reaches 91.28%. The resulting AI&#8208;powered active rehabilitation system can control a pneumatic robotic glove to assist stroke patients in completing movements according to the recognized human motion intention. Moreover, this HMI interface is further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms, such as manipulators, intelligent cars, and drones, paving the way for the design of future intelligent robot systems.

&lt;p&gt;Human-machine interaction (HMI) technology shows an important application prospect in rehabilitation medicine, but it is greatly limited by the unsatisfactory recognition accuracy and wearing comfort.

         <title>Peeling&#8208;Stiffening Self&#8208;Adhesive Ionogel with Superhigh Interfacial Toughness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;adhesive materials that can directly adhere to diverse solid surfaces are indispensable in modern life and technologies. However, it remains a challenge to develop self&#8208;adhesive materials with strong adhesion while maintaining its intrinsic softness for efficient tackiness. Here we report a peeling&#8208;stiffening self&#8208;adhesive ionogel that reconciles the seemingly contradictory properties of softness and strong adhesion. The ionogel contains two ionophilic repeating units with distinct associating affinities, which allows to adaptively wet rough surface in the soft dissipating state for adhering, and to dramatically stiffen to the glassy state upon peeling. The corresponding modulus increases by 117 times driven by strain rate&#8208;induced phase separation, which greatly suppresses crack propagation and results in a record&#8208;high interfacial toughness of 8046 J m&#8722;2. The self&#8208;adhesive ionogel is also transparent, self&#8208;healable, recyclable, and can be easily removed by simple moisture treatment. Our strategy provides a new way to design high&#8208;performance self&#8208;adhesive materials for intelligent soft devices.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Roughness&#8208;Induced Plasticity in a Biodegradable Zn Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) solves the dilemma of significantly improving plasticity at the expense of strength. From the unground state to the 5000# sandpaper ground state, room&#8208;temperature elongation of biodegradable Zn&#8211;0.4Mn alloy increases from 74% to 143% without loss of strength. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness.








Abstract
Improving plasticity has been an eternal theme of developing metallic materials. It is difficult to increase room&#8208;temperature elongation of metallic materials over 100% without sacrificing strength using existing methods. Herein, surface&#8208;roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) is discovered in biodegradable Zn&#8211;0.4Mn alloy. Surprisingly, in the good surface range that meets the international standard ISO 6892, reducing surface roughness results in significant increase in plasticity without loss of strength. From unground to 5000# sandpaper ground states, the surface roughness Ra of the alloy decreases from 0.63 to 0.05&#160;&#181;m, while its room temperature elongation increases from 74% to 143%. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness. It provides a new method for improving plasticity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Stretchable Sensor Arrays Exhibiting Magnetoelasticity for Real&#8208;Time Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain sensor based on a flexible NdFeB magnet to realize a wearable and self&#8208;powered sensor is reported, which provides open prospects for real&#8208;time gesture interaction based on an electromagnetic generator and is expected to achieve a wide range of future applications for intuitive and natural human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are highly desirable for human motion monitoring, and can be used to build new forms of bionic robots. However, the current use of flexible strain gauges is hindered by the need for an external power supply, and the demand for long&#8208;term operation. Here, a new flexible self&#8208;powered strain sensor system based on an electromagnetic generator that possesses a high stretchability in excess of 150%, a short response time of 30&#160;ms, and an excellent linearity (R2&#160;&gt; 0.98), is presented. Based on this new form of sensor, a human&#8211;machine interaction system is designed to achieve remote control of a robot hand and vehicle using a human hand, which provides a new scheme for real&#8208;time gesture interaction.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Fracture along Twin Boundaries in Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic structure of B4C and its fracture behaviors are investigated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected STEM and in situ TEM mechanical testing. The combination of in situ TEM observations and quantum mechanics calculations reveal that amorphous bands and crack initiation occur preferentially at the twin boundaries in B4C under mechanical loading, thus contributing to the failure of B4C.








Abstract
The observation of fracture behaviors in perfect and twinned B4C crystals via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing is reported. The crystal structure of the synthesized B4C, composed of B11C icosahedra connected by boron&#8208;deficient C&#8211;&#9643;&#8211;C chains in a chemical formula of B11C3, is determined by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected scanning TEM. The in situ TEM observations reveal that cracking is preferentially initiated at the twin boundaries (TBs) in B4C under both indentation and tension loading. The cracks then propagate along the TBs, thus resulting in the fracture of B4C. These results are consistent with the theoretical calculations that show that TBs have a softening effect on B4C with amorphous bands preferentially nucleated at the TBs. These findings elucidate the atomic arrangement and the role of planar defects in the failure of B4C. Furthermore, they can guide the design of advanced superhard materials via planar defect control.

         <title>The Negative&#8208;Charge&#8208;Triggered &#8220;Dead Zone&#8221; between Electrode and Current Collector Realizes Ultralong Cycle Life of Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, lightweight, durable, and low&#8208;cost current collector, MXene (Ti3C2Tx) film, is achieved for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. A large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups are incorporated onto the surface of the MXene film to form rich negative charges region on its surface, which shields the positive electrode material from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation in its &#8220;dead zone.&#8221;








Abstract
Typically, volume expansion of the electrodes after intercalation of active ions is highly undesirable yet inetvitable, and it can significantly reduce the adhesion force between the electrodes and current collectors. Especially in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), the intercalation of large&#8208;sized AlCl4&#8722; can greatly weaken this adhesion force and result in the detachment of the electrodes from the current collectors, which seems an inherent and irreconcilable problem. Here, an interesting concept, the &#8220;dead zone&#8221;, is presented to overcome the above challenge. By incorporating a large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups onto the surface of MXene film, a rich negative&#8208;charge region is formed on its surface. When used as the current collector for AIBs, it shields a tiny area of the positive electrode (adjacent to the current collector side) from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation due to the repulsion force, and a tiny inert layer (dead zone) at the interface of the positive electrode is formed, preventing the electrode from falling off the current collector. This helps to effectively increase the battery's cycle life to as high as 50&#160;000 times.

     alt="The Negative-Charge-Triggered &#8220;Dead Zone&#8221; between Electrode and Current Collector Realizes Ultralong Cycle Life of Aluminum-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stable, lightweight, durable, and low-cost current collector, MXene (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) film, is achieved for aluminum-ion batteries. A large number of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and COOH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups are incorporated onto the surface of the MXene film to form rich negative charges region on its surface, which shields the positive electrode material from AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation in its &#8220;dead zone.&#8221;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, volume expansion of the electrodes after intercalation of active ions is highly undesirable yet inetvitable, and it can significantly reduce the adhesion force between the electrodes and current collectors. Especially in aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs), the intercalation of large-sized AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can greatly weaken this adhesion force and result in the detachment of the electrodes from the current collectors, which seems an inherent and irreconcilable problem. Here, an interesting concept, the &#8220;dead zone&#8221;, is presented to overcome the above challenge. By incorporating a large number of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and COOH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups onto the surface of MXene film, a rich negative-charge region is formed on its surface. When used as the current collector for AIBs, it shields a tiny area of the positive electrode (adjacent to the current collector side) from AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation due to the repulsion force, and a tiny inert layer (dead zone) at the interface of the positive electrode is formed, preventing the electrode from falling off the current collector. This helps to effectively increase the battery's cycle life to as high as 50&#160;000 times. It is believed that the proposed concept can be an important reference for future development of current collectors in rocking chair batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exceptionally High Saturation Magnetic Flux Density and Ultralow Coercivity via an Amorphous&#8211;Nanocrystalline Transitional Microstructure in an FeCo&#8208;Based Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative compositional design concept enables the construction of a unique transitional microstructure between traditional amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys, which results in an alloy with an unprecedented combination of exceptionally high saturation magnetic flux density (Bs&#160;= 1.94 T) and ultralow coercivity (Hc&#160;= 4.3 A m&#8722;1), breaking the general trade&#8208;off between Bs and Hc in the soft&#8208;magnetic&#8208;material family.








Abstract
High saturation magnetic flux density (Bs) of soft magnetic materials is essential for increasing the power density of modern magnetic devices and motor machines. Yet, increasing Bs is always at the expense of high coercivity (Hc), presenting a general trade&#8208;off in the soft magnetic material family. Here, superior comprehensive soft magnetic properties, i.e., an exceptionally high Bs of up to 1.94 T and Hc as low as 4.3 A m&#8722;1 are unprecedentedly combined in an FeCo&#8208;based alloy. This alloy is obtained through a composition design strategy to construct a transitional microstructure between amorphous and traditional nanocrystalline alloys, with nanocrystals (with &lt; 5 nm&#8208;sized crystal&#8208;like regions around) sparsely dispersed in an amorphous matrix. Such transitional microstructure possesses extremely low magnetic anisotropy caused by the annihilation of quasi&#8208;dislocation dipoles, and a strong magnetic exchange interaction, which leads to excellent comprehensive magnetic properties. The results provide useful guidelines for the development of the next generation of soft magnetic materials, which are promising for applications of high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;efficiency, and energy&#8208;saving devices.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of sp&#8208;N Doping in Graphdiyne for Developing Site&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides opening the black box of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N) doping in graphdiyne, the relationship between N configurations and reaction routes in CO2 reduction is clarified. The sp&#8208;N atoms would induce high selectivity toward CH4 generation, owing to the optimized adsorption of precursor and intermediate. This work would guide the site&#8208;defined doping in carbon materials for advanced catalysts.








Abstract
Due to the limited reserves of metals, scientists are devoted to exploring high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free catalysts based on carbon materials to solve environment&#8208;related issues. Doping would build up inhomogeneous charge distribution on surface, which is an efficient approach for boosting the catalytic performance. However, doping sites are difficult to control in traditional carbon materials, thus hindering their development. Taking the advantage of unique sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (GDY), a new N doping configuration of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N), bringing a Pt&#8208;comparable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction is site&#8208;defined introduced. However, the reaction intermediate of this process is never captured, hindering the understanding of the mechanism and the precise synthesis of metal&#8208;free catalysts. After the four&#8208;year study, the fabrication of intermediate&#8208;like molecule is realized, and finally sp&#8208;N doped GDY via the pericyclic reaction is obtained. Compared with GDY doped with other N configurations, the designed sp&#8208;N GDY shows much higher catalytic activity in electroreduction of CO2 toward CH4 production, owing to the unique electronic structure introduced by sp&#8208;N, which is more favorable in stabilizing the intermediate. Thus, besides opening the black&#8208;box for the site&#8208;defined doping, this work reveals the relationship between doping configuration and products of CO2 reduction.

         <title>Extraordinary Solidification Mechanism of Liquid Alloys Under Acoustic Levitation State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic levitation is an advanced containerless processing technique for simulating a space environment, and provides an effective approach to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. The physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, crystal nucleation, and dendritic and eutectic growth within acoustically levitated droplets are demonstrated comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys.








Abstract
The acoustic levitation of various materials can be realized by highly intensive ultrasound, which provides a free surface and containerless state for materials processing under space simulation conditions. The nonlinear effects such as acoustic radiation pressure, acoustic streaming, and ultrasonic cavitation open up special access to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. Here, the physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, and crystal nucleation and growth within acoustically levitated droplets are explored comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys. The sectorial shape oscillations of the 2nd to 10th order modes accompanying internal potential flow are observed for water droplets with modulated ultrasound amplitudes, while the enhanced ultrasound intensity promotes ice nucleation and thus reduces water undercooling. The migration of Sn&#8208;rich globules during phase separation of immiscible Al&#8211;Cu&#8211;Sn alloy is dominated by the droplet deformation and rotation related to acoustic levitation. The high undercooling states of liquid Ag&#8211;Cu&#8211;Ge and Ni&#8211;Sn alloys during acoustic levitation result in the refinement of (Ag) dendrites and the formation of anomalous (Ni+Ni3Sn) eutectics. The ultrasound&#8211;liquid interaction also induces surface waves during the containerless solidification of Ag&#8211;Cu and Ni&#8211;Sn eutectic alloys.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Activity via Atom&#8208;Stepped Interfaces Architected with Kinetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy yet stable interface architecture with abundant catalytically active atom steps can be facilely fabricated by utilizing the kinetic frustration effect in glass&#8208;forming alloys during rapid solidification. These atomic steps can be well stabilized due to the confinement effect imposed by the disordered glassy matrix and provide fast&#8208;catalytic kinetics for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction.








Abstract
A highly active interface is extremely critical for the catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst; however, facilely tailoring its atomic packing characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported to obtain copious high&#8208;energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass&#8208;forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi3 nanocrystals are in&#160;situ formed in an Fe&#63743;Ni&#63743;B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free&#8208;standing FeNi3 nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen&#8208;evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid&#8208;solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi3) in glass&#8208;forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic&#8208;level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly active interface is extremely critical for the catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst; however, facilely tailoring its atomic packing characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported to obtain copious high-energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass-forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals are in&#160;situ formed in an Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Ni&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free-standing FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen-evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state-of-the-art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid-solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in glass-forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic-level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost-effective electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries with Ultrahigh Rate and Extremely Long Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroaromatic hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) material is reported, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated. The enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability and long cycling life.








Abstract
Electroactive organic materials with tailored functional groups are of great importance for aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries due to their green and renewable nature. Herein, a completely new N&#8208;heteroaromatic material, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) is designed and synthesized, by an acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries demonstrated. Compared with phenazine monomer, it is revealed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of N&#8208;heteroaromatics can effectively increase electron delocalization, thereby improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability. As expected, the HATN&#8208;PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, ultrahigh rate capability of 144&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and an extremely long cycle life of 45&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Investigation of the charge&#8208;storage mechanism demonstrates the synergistic coordination of both Zn2+ and H+ cations with the phenanthroline groups, with Zn2+ first followed by H+, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. This work provides a molecular&#8208;engineering strategy for superior organic materials and adds new insights to understand the charge&#8208;storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Controllable Gold Nanocluster&#8211;Emulsion Interface for Direct Cell Penetration and Photothermal Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed tailorable amphiphilic gold nanoclusters facilitate the dynamic formation of emulsions by engaging in interfacial coupling, which enhances emulsion stability and nanocluster photophysical performance. The segregated interfacial microdomains of nanoclusters on the emulsion surface determine their biointerfacial interactions and allow them to directly penetrate cell membranes. The developed functional emulsions are well suited for multifluorescence tracing and photothermal killing.








Abstract
In the view of their ability to be uptaken by cells, colloidal particles can exert diverse physiological effects and are promising vehicles for the intracellular delivery of biologically active substances. Given that the modulation of biomaterial interfaces greatly facilitates the prediction and control of the corresponding cellular responses, the interfacial behavior of hydrophobic dye&#8208;modified gold (Au) nanoclusters (Au NCs) is rationally designed to develop Au NC&#8208;containing emulsions and control their biointerfacial interactions with cell membranes. The observed biological performance is indicative of a physical penetration mechanism. The amphiphilic Au NCs decrease the interfacial energy of two immiscible liquids and hinder droplet coalescence to facilitate the formation of emulsions thermodynamically stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the amphiphilic Au NCs are localized on the emulsion droplet surface and form segregated interfacial microdomains that adapt to the membrane structure and facilitate the traverse of the emulsions across the cell membrane via direct penetration. Fast penetration coupled with excellent photophysical performance endows the emulsions with multifluorescence tracing and efficient photothermal killing capabilities. The successful change of the interaction mode between NCs and biological objects and the provision of a universal formulation to modulate biointerfacial interactions are expected to inspire new bioapplications.

         <title>Vacancy Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Electrocatalysts: From Aggregated to Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals, progress, and prospects of vacancy engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward electrocatalytic applications are reviewed. Vacancy manufacturing strategies, characterization techniques, and unique roles in electrocatalysis are considered, and the evolution of vacancy configuration from aggregated to atomic distribution is comprehensively discussed. The lifetime dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations of vacancy&#8208;mediated electrocatalysts are also highlighted.








Abstract
Vacancy defect engineering has been well leveraged to flexibly shape comprehensive physicochemical properties of diverse catalysts. In particular, growing research effort has been devoted to engineering chalcogen anionic vacancies (S/Se/Te) of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) toward the ultimate performance limit of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In spite of remarkable progress achieved in the past decade, systematic and in&#8208;depth insights into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacancy engineering for 2D&#8208;TMDs&#8208;based electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, this review delivers a full picture of vacancy engineering evolving from aggregated to atomic configurations covering their development background, controllable manufacturing, thorough characterization, and representative HER application. Of particular interest, the deep&#8208;seated correlations between specific vacancy regulation routes and resulting catalytic performance improvement are logically clarified in terms of atomic rearrangement, charge redistribution, energy band variation, intermediate adsorption&#8211;desorption optimization, and charge/mass transfer facilitation. Beyond that, a broader vision is cast into the cutting&#8208;edge research fields of vacancy&#8208;engineering&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysis and dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations across catalyst service lifetime. Together with critical discussion on residual challenges and future prospects, this review sheds new light on the rational design of advanced defect catalysts and navigates their broader application in high&#8208;efficiency energy conversion and storage fields.

         <title>Powder Metallurgy Route to Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Refractory Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sintering refractory metals/alloys to high density while maintaining fine microstructure is of paramount importance to ensure their applications. A comprehensive understanding of the sintering issues and microstructural design rules is discussed. Powder metallurgy advances in specific materials systems, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), and refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys and their composites are reviewed.








Abstract
Ultrafine&#8208;grained (UFG) refractory metals are promising materials for applications in aerospace, microelectronics, nuclear energy, and many others under extreme environments. Powder metallurgy (PM) allows to produce such materials with well&#8208;controlled chemistry and microstructure at multiple length scales and near&#8208;net shape manufacturing. However, sintering refractory metals to full density while maintaining a fine microstructure is still challenging due to the high sintering temperature and the difficulty to separate the kinetics of densification versus grain growth. Here an overview of the sintering issues, microstructural design rules, and PM practices towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals are sought to be provided. The previous efforts shall be reviewed to address the processing challenges, including the use of fine/nanopowders, second&#8208;phase grain growth inhibitors, and field&#8208;assisted sintering techniques. Recently, pressureless two&#8208;step sintering has been successfully demonstrated in producing dense UFG refractory metals down to &#8776;300&#160;nm average grain size with a uniform microstructure and this technological breakthrough shall be reviewed. PM progresses in specific materials systems shall be next reviewed, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys, and their composites. Last, future developments and the endeavor towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals with exceptionally uniform microstructure and improved properties are outlined.

         <title>Role of Interfaces in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;solid interfaces play a critical role in the electrochemical performance of solid&#8208;state batteries. This review provides an overview on the solid&#8211;solid interfaces from aspects of structural features, Li&#8208;ion transport, interfacial contact, and electro&#8208;chemical reactions. The existing interface issues and improvement strategies are discussed. Opportunities and future trends on the investigation and optimization of these interfaces are highlighted.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology, because they simultaneously exhibit high safety, high energy density, and wide operating temperature range. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes produces numerous solid&#8211;solid interfaces within the SSBs. A thorough understanding on the roles of these interfaces is indispensable for the rational performance optimization. In this review, the interface issues in the SSBs, including internal buried interfaces within solid electrolytes and composite electrodes, and planar interfaces between electrodes and solid electrolyte separators or current collectors are discussed. The challenges and future directions on the investigation and optimization of these solid&#8211;solid interfaces for the production of the SSBs are also assessed.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure Dynamics of Nanocrystals Revealed By In Situ and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of in situ and environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and recent advances in structure dynamics of nanocrystals are reviewed. The nucleation and growth of nanocrystals, structure dynamics, and structure evolution under reaction conditions are discussed in detail. The methodologies and challenges of in situ TEM are also proposed.








Abstract
Nanocrystals are of great importance in material sciences and industry. Engineering nanocrystals with desired structures and properties is no doubt one of the most important challenges in the field, which requires deep insight into atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of nanocrystals during the process. The rapid developments of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), especially environmental TEM, reveal insights into nanocrystals to digest. According to the considerable progress based on in situ electron microscopy, a comprehensive review on nanocrystal dynamics from three aspects: nucleation and growth, structure evolution, and dynamics in reaction conditions are given. In the nucleation and growth part, existing nucleation theories and growth pathways are organized based on liquid and gas&#8211;solid phases. In the structure evolution part, the focus is on in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the evolution, including defects, phase, and disorder/order transitions. In the part of dynamics in reaction conditions, solid&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;solid interfaces of nanocrystals in atmosphere are discussed and the structure&#8211;property relationship is correlated. Even though impressive progress is made, additional efforts are required to develop the integrated and operando TEM methodologies for unveiling nanocrystal dynamics with high spatial, energy, and temporal resolutions.

         <title>P&#8208;Type 2D Semiconductors for Future Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D semiconductors represent one of the most promising candidates to extend Moore's law. However, their full potential has been greatly hindered by the limited p&#8208;type ones with high performance and stability. This review offers a comprehensive discussion of the fundamentals, current status, and outlook of p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors, aiming to inspire relevant research for advanced future electronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors represent one of the best candidates to extend Moore's law for their superiorities, such as keeping high carrier mobility and remarkable gate&#8208;control capability at atomic thickness. Complementary transistors and van der Waals junctions are critical in realizing 2D semiconductors&#8208;based integrated circuits suitable for future electronics. N&#8208;type 2D semiconductors have been reported predominantly for the strong electron doping caused by interfacial charge impurities and internal structural defects. By contrast, superior and reliable p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors with holes as majority carriers are still scarce. Not only that, but some critical issues have not been adequately addressed, including their controlled synthesis in wafer size and high quality, defect and carrier modulation, optimization of interface and contact, and application in high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power integrated devices. Here the material toolkit, synthesis strategies, device basics, and digital electronics closely related to p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors are reviewed. Their opportunities, challenges, and prospects for future electronic applications are also discussed, which would be promising or even shining in the post&#8208;Moore era.

         <dc:description>
Although research on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials has been booming for decades, more research is needed on how to utilize them to construct efficient information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. A review of recent representative studies on information sensing, processing, and feedback devices based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials to provide a perspective on developing human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interaction technologies is presented.








Abstract
A wide variety of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with excellent properties can meet almost all the requirements of functional materials for information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. Low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are becoming the star of hope on the road to pursuing human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interactions, benefiting from the breakthroughs in precise preparation, performance regulation, structural design, and device construction in recent years. This review summarizes several types of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials commonly used in human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interactions and outlines the differences in properties and application areas of different materials. According to the sequence of information flow in the human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing interaction process, the representative research progress of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials&#8208;based information sensing, processing, and feedback devices is reviewed and the key roles played by low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are discussed. Finally, the development trends and existing challenges of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials in the field of human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interaction technology are discussed.

         <title>Van der Waals&#8208;Interface&#8208;Dominated All&#8208;2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with traditional silicon&#8208;based devices, the unique features of all&#8208;2D electronics are atomic flatness and dangling&#8208;bond van der Waals interfaces, including all&#8208;2D metal/semiconductor, all&#8208;2D semiconductor/semiconductor, and all&#8208;2D dielectric/semiconductor interfaces. These interfaces provide an excellent device platform for removing lattice matching constraints, suppressing carrier scattering, and exploiting new physical effects.








Abstract
The interface is the device. As the feature size rapidly shrinks, silicon&#8208;based electronic devices are facing multiple challenges of material performance decrease and interface quality degradation. Ultrathin 2D materials are considered as potential candidates in future electronics by their atomically flat surfaces and excellent immunity to short&#8208;channel effects. Moreover, due to naturally terminated surfaces and weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, 2D materials can be freely stacked without the lattice matching limit to form high&#8208;quality heterostructure interfaces with arbitrary components and twist angles. Controlled interlayer band alignment and optimized interfacial carrier behavior allow all&#8208;2D electronics based on 2D vdW interfaces to exhibit more comprehensive functionality and better performance. Especially, achieving the same computing capacity of multiple conventional devices with small footprint all&#8208;2D devices is considered to be the key development direction of future electronics. Herein, the unique properties of all&#8208;2D vdW interfaces and their construction methods are systematically reviewed and the main performance contributions of different vdW interfaces in 2D electronics are summarized, respectively. Finally, the recent progress and challenges for all&#8208;2D vdW electronics are discussed, and how to improve the compatibility of 2D material devices with silicon&#8208;based industrial technology is pointed out as a critical challenge.

         <title>Priority and Prospect of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review expounds on why implementing a membrane&#8208;based electrolyte is the priority for mass production of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries and identifies critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide electrolyte membrane. The challenges and associated strategies for achieving these criteria in terms of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration are systematically analyzed and summarized.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) promise sustainable energy storage systems with energy&#8208;dense integration and critical intrinsic safety, yet they still require cost&#8208;effective manufacturing and the integration of thin membrane&#8208;based SE separators into large&#8208;format cells to achieve scalable deployment. This review, based on an overview of sulfide SE materials, is expounded on why implementing a thin membrane&#8208;based separator is the priority for mass production of ASSLBs and critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide SE membrane are identified. Moreover, from the aspects of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration, the major challenges and associated strategies are described to meet these criteria throughout the whole manufacturing chain to provide a realistic assessment of the current status of sulfide SE membranes. Finally, future directions and prospects for scalable and manufacturable sulfide SE membranes for ASSLBs are presented.

This review, based on an overview of sulfide SE materials, is expounded on why implementing a thin membrane-based separator is the priority for mass production of ASSLBs and critical criteria for capturing a high-quality thin sulfide SE membrane are identified. Moreover, from the aspects of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration, the major challenges and associated strategies are described to meet these criteria throughout the whole manufacturing chain to provide a realistic assessment of the current status of sulfide SE membranes. Finally, future directions and prospects for scalable and manufacturable sulfide SE membranes for ASSLBs are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum Prodrug Nanoparticles with COX&#8208;2 Inhibition Amplifies Pyroptosis for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immune Activation of Pancreatic Cancer</title>

Abstract
Pyroptosis, an emerging mechanism of programmed cell death, holds great potential to trigger a robust antitumor immune response. Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents can induce pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 activation. However, these agents also enhance cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) expression, leading to drug resistance and immune evasion in pancreatic cancer and significantly limiting the effectiveness of chemotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis. Herein, we developed an amphiphilic polymer (denoted as PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In) containing both indomethacin (In, a COX&#8208;2 inhibitor) and platinum prodrug (Pt(IV)), which is responsive to glutathione (GSH). This polymer self&#8208;assembled into form nanoparticles (denoted as Pt&#8208;In NP) that can disintegrate in cancer cells due to the GSH responsiveness, releasing In to inhibit the COX&#8208;2 expression, hence overcoming the chemoresistance and amplifying cisplatin&#8208;induced pyroptosis. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, Pt&#8208;In NP significantly inhibit tumor growth and elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. Moreover, when combined with anti&#8208;programmed death ligand (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) treatment, Pt&#8208;In NP demonstrate the ability to completely suppress metastatic tumors, transforming &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into &#8220;hot tumors&#8221;. Overall, the sustained release of Pt(IV) and In from Pt&#8208;In NP amplifies platnium&#8208;drug&#8208;induced pyroptosis to elicit long&#8208;term immune responses, hence presenting a generalizable strategy for pancreatic cancer.

         <title>Selective Shielding of the (002) Plane Enabling Vertically Oriented Zinc Plating for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>

Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites hinders the future development of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Despite that (100) plane possesses better zincophilic ability and fast kinetics, dendrites were generally suppressed via (002) plane&#8208;oriented Zn deposition in previous reports; the ordered (100) plane&#8208;dominant Zn deposition especially under high current density have not yet been realized. Herein, we report vertically&#8208;oriented Zn plating with preferential growth of (100) plane using disodium lauryl phosphate (DLP) as an electrolyte additive. DLP is preferentially anchored on the Zn (002) crystal plane via polar phosphate group, then the deposition of Zn atoms on the (002) plane is retarded by the long alkyl chain, finally promoting the preferred growth of the (100) plane. This unique growth pattern results in ultrastable Zn plating/stripping at super&#8208;high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative capacity of 8500 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell also cycles steadily for 700&#160;h with a large areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study provides new insights into the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes by crystal plane modulation.

         <title>Novel Ultra&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional SbBi Alloy Structure with Precise Regulation Ratio Enables Long&#8208;Stable Potassium/Lithium ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The inferior cycling stabilities or low capacities of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Sb or Bi limit their practical applications in high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;stability potassium/lithium ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs). Therefore, integrating the synergy of high&#8208;capacity Sb and high&#8208;stability Bi to fabricate 2D binary alloys is an intriguing and challenging endeavor. Herein, a series of novel 2D binary SbBi alloys with different atomic ratios are fabricated using a simple one&#8208;step co&#8208;replacement method. Among these fabricated alloys, 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode exhibits high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable potassium and lithium storage performance. Particularly, 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode remains a high&#8208;stability capacity of 381.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 (&#8764;87.8% retention) and an ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycling stability of 1000 cycles (only 0.037% decay per cycle) at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 in PIBs. Besides, the superior lithium and potassium storage mechanism was revealed by kinetic analysis, in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques, and DFT theoretical calculations. This mainly originates from the ultra&#8208;stable structure and synergistic interaction within 2D&#8208;binary alloy, which significantly alleviates the volume expansion, enhances K+ adsorption energy and decreases K+ diffusion energy barrier compared to individual 2D&#8208;Bi or 2D&#8208;Sb. This study verifies a new scalable design strategy for creating 2D binary (even ternary) alloys, offering valuable insights into their fundamental mechanisms in rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Multiple H&#8208;bonding Cross&#8208;Linked Supramolecular Solid&#8208;Solid Phase Change Materials for Thermal Energy Storage And Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) are considered among the most promising candidates for thermal energy storage and management. However, the application of SSPCMs is consistently hindered by the canonical trade&#8208;off between high thermal energy storage capacity and mechanical robustness. In addition, they suffer from poor recyclability due to chemical cross&#8208;linking. Herein, a straightforward but effective strategy for fabricating supramolecular SSPCMs with high latent heat and mechanical strength is proposed. The supramolecular polymer employs multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions as robust physical cross&#8208;links. This enables SSPCM with a high enthalpy of phase transition (142.5 J g&#8722;1), strong mechanical strength (36.9&#160;MPa), and sound shape stability (maintaining shape integrity at 120&#176;C) even with a high content of phase change component (97 wt%). When SSPCM is utilized to regulate the operating temperature of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), it significantly diminishes the battery working temperature by 23&#176;C at a discharge rate of 3C. The robust thermal management capability enabled through solid&#8208;solid phase change provides practical opportunities for applications in fast discharging and high&#8208;power batteries. Overall, this study presents a feasible strategy for designing linear SSPCMs with high latent heat and exceptional mechanical strength for thermal management.

         <title>Time&#8208;sequential and Multi&#8208;functional 3d Printed Mgo2/PLGA Scaffold Developed as A Novel Biodegradable and Bioactive Bone Substitute for Challenging Postsurgical Osteosarcoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most commonly occurring primary bone malignant tumor. The clinical postsurgical OS treatment faces big challenges for the staged therapeutic requirements of early anti&#8208;tumor, anti&#8208;bacterial, and long&#8208;lasting osteogenesis. Herein, multi&#8208;functional bioactive scaffolds with time&#8208;sequential functions of prevent tumor recurrence, inhibit bacterial infection and promote bone defect repair have been rationally designed as a novel strategy. Nanocomposite scaffold magnesium peroxide (MgO2)/poly (lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide (PLGA) is prepared by low&#8208;temperature 3D printing for controllable releasing magnesium ions (Mg2+) and ROS in a time&#8208;sequential manner. The scaffold with 20 wt% MgO2 (20MP) is verified with desired mechanical properties, as well as exhibits staged release behavior of bioactive elements with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release for the first 3 weeks, and long&#8208;lasting Mg2+ release for 12 weeks. The released H2O2 initiates chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to induce apoptosis and ferroptosis in tumor cells, along with activating the anticancer immune microenvironment by M1 polarization of macrophages. The released Mg2+ subsequently enhances bone repair by activating the Wnt3a/GSK&#8208;3&#946;/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling pathway to promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and creating osteopromotive immune microenvironment by M2 polarization of macrophages. In conclusion, the multi&#8208;functional 20MP scaffold demonstrates time&#8208;sequential therapeutic properties as an innovative strategy for OS&#8208;associated challenging bone defect treatment.

The released Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; subsequently enhances bone repair by activating the Wnt3a/GSK-3&#946;/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway to promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and creating osteopromotive immune microenvironment by M2 polarization of macrophages. In conclusion, the multi-functional 20MP scaffold demonstrates time-sequential therapeutic properties as an innovative strategy for OS-associated challenging bone defect treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bridging The Catalytic Turnover Gap Between Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozymes and Natural Enzymes by Engineering the First And Second Shell Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzyme) constitute a promising category of enzyme&#8208;mimicking materials with outstanding catalytic performance. The performance of SAzymes has been improved through modification of the coordination environments around the metal center. However, the catalytic turnover rates of SAzymes, which are key measures of the effectiveness of active site modifications, remain lower than those of natural enzymes, especially in peroxidase&#8208;reactions. Here, we report on the first and second shell coordination tuning strategy that yields SAzymes with structures and activities analogous to those of natural enzymes. The optimized SAzyme exhibited a turnover rate of 52.7 s&#8722;1 and a catalytic efficiency of 6.97 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. A computational study revealed that axial S&#8208;ligands induce an alternative reaction mechanism and SO2&#8208;functional groups provide hydrogen bonds to reduce the activation energy. Additionally, SAzyme showed superior anti&#8208;tumor ability in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate the validity of coordination engineering strategies and the carcinostatic potential of SAzymes.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite into Subnanometer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Within the intersection of materials science and nanoscience/technology, extremely downsized (including quantum&#8208;sized and subnanometer&#8208;sized) materials have attracted increasing interest. However, the effective and controllable production of extremely downsized materials through physical strategies remains a great challenge. Herein, we report an all&#8208;physical top&#8208;down method for the production of sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene with completely broken lattice. The graphene subnanometer materials (GSNs) with monolayer structures and lateral sizes of approximately 0.5&#160;nm are obtained. Compared with their bulk, nanosheets, and quantum sheets, the intrinsic GSNs present extremely enhanced photoluminescence and nonlinear saturation absorption performances, as well as unique carrier behavior. The non&#8208;equilibrium states induced by the entirely exposed and broken, intrinsic lattices in sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene could be determinative to their extreme performances. Our work shows the great potential of broken lattice and provides new insights towards subnanometer materials.

         <title>Transport&#8208;limited Growth of Coccolith Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biogenic crystals present a variety of complex morphologies that form with exquisite fidelity. In the case of the intricate morphologies of coccoliths, calcite crystals produced by marine algae, only a single set of crystallographic facets is utilized. It is unclear which growth process can merge this simple crystallographic habit with the species&#8208;specific architectures. Here, we use a suite of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electron microscopies to follow both the growth trajectories of the crystals ex situ, and the cellular environment in situ, in the species Emiliania huxleyi. We show that crystal growth alternates between a space filling and a skeletonized growth mode, where the crystals elongate via their stable crystallographic facets, but the final morphology is a manifestation of growth arrest. This process is reminiscent of the balance between reaction&#8208;limited and transport&#8208;limited growth regimes underlying snowflake formation. We suggest that localized ion transport regulates the kinetic instabilities that are required for transport&#8208;limited growth, leading to reproducible morphologies.

         <title>Eco&#8208;friendly Solvent Engineered CsPbI2.77Br0.23 Ink for Large&#8208;Area And Scalable High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The performance of large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells has been assessed for typical compositions, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), using a blade coater, slot&#8208;die coater, solution shearing, ink&#8208;jet printing, and thermal evaporation. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films is not well developed. This study developed, for the first time, an eco&#8208;friendly solvent engineered all&#8208;inorganic perovskite ink of dimethyl sulfoxide as a main solvent with the addition of acetonitrile, 2&#8208;methoxyethanol, or a mixture of acetonitrile and 2&#8208;methoxyethanol to fabricate large&#8208;area CsPbI2.77Br0.23 films with slot&#8208;die coater at low temperatures (40&#8211;50&#176;C). We thoroughly examined the perovskite phase, morphology, defect density, and optoelectrical properties of new inks prepared with different solvent ratios and correlated them with their respective colloidal size distribution and solar cell performance. The optimized slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated CsPbI2.77Br0.23 perovskite film, which was prepared from the eco&#8208;friendly binary solvents dimethyl sulfoxide:acetonitrile (0.8:0.2 v/v), demonstrated an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.05%. Moreover, the device maintained ca. 91% of its original power conversion efficiency after one month at 20% relative humidity in the dark. We believe that this study will accelerate the reliable manufacturing of perovskite devices.

         <title>Ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II Ratiometric Nanothermometers for 3D In Vivo Thermal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Luminescent nanothermometry, particularly the one based ratiometric, has sparked intense research for non&#8208;invasive in vivo or intracellular temperature mapping, empowering their uses as diagnosis tools in biomedicine. However, ratiometric detection still suffers from biased sensing induced by wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering, low thermal sensitivity (Sr), and lack of imaging depth information. Herein, we construct an ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II ratiometric nanothermometer with self&#8208;calibrating ability for 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, in which temperature&#8208;insensitive lanthanide nanocrystals and strongly temperature&#8208;quenched Ag2S quantum dots are co&#8208;assembled to form a hybrid nanocomposite material. Precise control over the amount ratio between two sub&#8208;materials enables the manipulation of heat&#8208;activated back energy transfer from Ag2S to Yb3+ in lanthanide nanoparticles, thereby rendering Sr up to 7.8% &#176;C&#8722;1 at 43.5 &#176;C, and higher than 6.5% &#176;C&#8722;1 over the entire physiological temperature range. Moreover, the luminescence intensity ratio between two separated spectral regions within the narrow Yb3+ emission peak is used to determine the depth information of nanothermometers in living mice and correct the effect of tissue depth on 2D thermographic imaging, and therefore allows a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of accurate 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, constituting a solid step towards the development of advanced ratiometric nanothermometry for biological applications.

The advent of intelligent display devices has given rise to diverse and complex demands for miniature light&#8208;emitting devices. Light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces have emerged as a practical and efficient means of achieving precise light modulation. However, their practicality is limited by certain constraints. Firstly, there is a need for further exploration of the ability to manipulate both pumping and emitting light simultaneously. Secondly, there is currently no encoding freedom in multi&#8208;dimensional emitting light. To address these concerns, we propose using meta&#8208;atoms to encode both fluorescence and pumping light independently, and expand the encoding freedom with different incident wavevector directions. We further demonstrate a light&#8208;emitting metasurface with quad&#8208;fold multiplex encoding meta&#8208;displays, including dual scattering images and dual fluorescence images. Our design strategy not only manipulates both pumping and fluorescence light, but also broadens encoding freedom for comprehensive multi&#8208;functionality. This could pave the way for multiplexing optical displays, information storage, and next&#8208;generation wearable displays.

         <title>Accelerated Confined Mass Transfer of MoS2 1d Nanotube in Photo&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8722;Air Batteries</title>

Abstract
Applying the solar energy into energy storage battery systems is challenged in achieving green and sustainable development, however, the efficient progress of photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8722;air batteries is restricted by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes upon the photocathode. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional ordered MoS2 nanotube (MoS2&#8208;ONT) with confined mass transfer can be used to extend the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, which is capable of overcoming the challenge of rapid recombination of electron and holes. The tubular confined space can not only promote the orderly separation and migration of charge carriers, but also realize the accumulation of charge and the rapid activation of oxygen molecules. The concave surface of MoS2&#8208;ONT can improve the carrier separation ability and prolong the carrier lifetime. Meanwhile, the ordered tubular confined space can effectively realize the rapid transfer of charge, ion and oxygen. Under light irradiation, a fast ORR kinetic of 70&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8722;air battery is achieved, which is the highest value reported for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8722;air batteries. Significantly, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8722;O2 battery based on MoS2&#8208;ONT also shows superior rate capability and other exciting battery performance. This work shows the universality of the confined carrier separation strategy in photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8722;air batteries.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Layered Perovskite Coated with In&#8208;situ Exsolved Core&#8208;shell CuFe@FeOx Nanoparticles for Efficient CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are promising energy conversion devices capable of efficiently transforming CO2 into CO, reducing CO2 emissions, and alleviating the greenhouse effect. However, the development of a suitable cathode material remains a critical challenge. Here we report a new SOEC cathode for CO2 electrolysis consisting of high&#8208;entropy Pr0.8Sr1.2(CuFe)0.4Mo0.2Mn0.2Nb0.2O4&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PSCFMMN) layered perovskite uniformly coated with in&#8208;situ exsolved core&#8208;shell structured CuFe alloy@FeOx (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. Single cells with the HE&#8208;PSCFMMN&#8208;CFA@FeO cathode exhibits a consistently high current density of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 for CO2 reduction at 1.5&#160;V while maintaining excellent stability for up to 200&#160;h under 0.75 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C in pure CO2. In&#8208;situ XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the exsolution of CFA@FeO nanoparticles introduces additional oxygen vacancies within HE&#8208;PSCFMMN substrate, acting as active reaction sites. More importantly, the abundant oxygen vacancies in FeOx shell, in contrast to conventional in&#8208;situ exsolved nanoparticles, enable the extension of the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) from the CFA@FeO/HE&#8208;PSCFMMN interface to the entire FeOx shell, thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.

         <title>Biomimetic Targeting Nanoadjuvants for Sonodynamic And Chronological Multi&#8208;Immunotherapy Against Holistic Biofilm&#8208;Related Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;related infections (BRIs) present significant challenges owing to drug resistance, adverse immune responses, and implant failure; however, current approaches inadequately cater to the diverse therapeutic requirements at different stages of infection. To address this issue, we proposed a multi&#8208;immunotherapy strategy in combination with sonodynamic therapy for the chronological treatment of BRIs. Macrophage membrane&#8208;decorated targeting sonosensitive nanoadjuvants were fabricated to load cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CPG&#8208;ODN) or microRNA (miR)&#8208;21&#8208;5p. In the early stages of BRI (Stage I), CPG&#8208;ODN&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (CPG@HMPN@M) promoted the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps to capture and neutralize detached microbes. During the late stage of infection (Stage II), CPG&#8208;ODNs redirected macrophage polarization into the M1 phase to combat infections via TLR9/Myd88/TRAF6 pathway. During these stages, CPG@HMPN@M generated singlet oxygen through sonodynamic processes, eradicating the biofilms under US irradiation. Once the BRIs were eliminated, miR&#8208;21&#8208;5p&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (miR@HMPN@M) were delivered to the lesions to suppress excessive inflammation and promote tissue integration by evoking macrophage M2 polarization during the repair phase (Stage III) through PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. This innovative approach aimed to provide comprehensive treatment strategies for the chronological treatment of BRI by effectively eliminating infections, promoting tissue restoration, and implementing different immune regulations at different stages, thus demonstrating promising clinical value.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing System for Polydicyclopentadiene Thermosets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing offers promise for addressing structural failures, increasing lifespan, and improving durability in polymeric materials. Implementing self&#8208;healing in thermoset polymers faces significant manufacturing challenges, especially due to elevated temperature requirements of thermoset processing. To introduce self&#8208;healing into structural thermosets, the self&#8208;healing system must be thermally stable and compatible with the thermoset chemistry. Here we demonstrate a self&#8208;healing microcapsule&#8208;based system stable to frontal polymerization (FP), a rapid and energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing process with a self&#8208;propagating exothermic reaction (&#8776; 200&#160;&#176;C). A thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type complex bearing two N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands addresses limitations in conventional G2&#8208;based self&#8208;healing approaches. Under FP's elevated temperatures, the catalyst remained dormant until activated by the Cu(I) co&#8208;reagent, ensuring efficient polymerization of the dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) upon damage to the polyDCPD matrix. The two&#8208;part microcapsule system consisted of one capsule containing the thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type catalyst dissolved in the solvent, and another capsule containing a Cu(I) coagent blended with liquid DCPD monomer. Using same chemistry for both matrix fabrication and healing resulted in strong interfaces as demonstrated by lap&#8208;shear tests. In an optimized system, the self&#8208;healing system restored the mechanical properties of the tough polyDCPD thermoset. Self&#8208;healing efficiencies greater than 90% via tapered double cantilever beam tests were observed.

         <title>Age&#8208;associated Senescent &#8211; T Cell Signaling Promotes Type 3 Immunity that Inhibits the Biomaterial Regenerative Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aging is associated with immunological changes that compromise response to infections and vaccines, exacerbate inflammatory diseases and could potentially mitigate tissue repair. Even so, age&#8208;related changes to the immune response to tissue damage and regenerative medicine therapies remain unknown. Here, we characterized how aging induces changes in immunological signatures that inhibit tissue repair and therapeutic response to a clinical regenerative biological scaffold derived from extracellular matrix. Signatures of inflammation and interleukin (IL)&#8208;17 signaling increased with injury and treatment both locally and regionally in aged animals, and computational analysis uncovered age&#8208;associated senescent&#8208;T cell communication that promotes type 3 immunity in T cells. Local inhibition of type 3 immune activation using IL17&#8208;neutralizing antibodies improved healing and restored therapeutic response to the regenerative biomaterial, promoting muscle repair in older animals. These results provide insights into tissue immune dysregulation that occurs with aging that can be targeted to rejuvenate repair.

Here, we characterized how aging induces changes in immunological signatures that inhibit tissue repair and therapeutic response to a clinical regenerative biological scaffold derived from extracellular matrix. Signatures of inflammation and interleukin (IL)-17 signaling increased with injury and treatment both locally and regionally in aged animals, and computational analysis uncovered age-associated senescent-T cell communication that promotes type 3 immunity in T cells. Local inhibition of type 3 immune activation using IL17-neutralizing antibodies improved healing and restored therapeutic response to the regenerative biomaterial, promoting muscle repair in older animals. These results provide insights into tissue immune dysregulation that occurs with aging that can be targeted to rejuvenate repair.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Longevous Cycling of Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Battery Enabled by &#8220;raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; Cobalt Oxynitride/Porous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts</title>

Abstract
Developing commercially viable electrocatalyst lies at the research hotspot of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries, but it is still challenging to meet the requirements of energy efficiency and durability in realistic applications. Strategic material design is critical to addressing its drawbacks in terms of sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions and limited battery lifespan. Herein, a &#8220;raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; architecture is designed for a hybrid catalyst constituting cobalt nitride as the core nanoparticle with thin oxidized coverings, which is further deposited within porous carbon aerogel. Based on synchrotron&#8208;based characterizations, this hybrid provides oxygen vacancies and Co&#8208;Nx&#8208;C sites as the active sites, resulting from a strong coupling between CoOxNy nanoparticles and 3D conductive carbon scaffolds. Compared to the oxide reference, it performs enhanced stability in harsh electrocatalytic environments, highlighting the benefits of the oxynitride. Furthermore, the 3D conductive scaffolds improve charge/mass transportation and boost durability of these active sites. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduced N species into hybrid can synergistically tune the d&#8208;band center of cobalt and improve its bifunctional activity. As a result, the obtained air cathode exhibits bifunctional overpotential of 0.65&#160;V and a battery lifetime exceeding 1350 hours, which sets a new record for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery reported so far.

         <title>Unconventional Synthesis of Hierarchically Twinned Copper as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Nitrate&#8211;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Twin boundary (TB) engineering provides exciting opportunities to tune the performance levels of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, the controllable construction of TB greatly relies on surfactants, blocking active sites and electron transfer by surfactants. Here, we propose a surfactant&#8208;free and facile strategy for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical TB networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H2. As revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the formation of HTBs is associated with the fragmentation of nanosheets in different directions to generate abundant crystal nuclei and subsequently unconventional crystal growth through the collision and coalescence of nuclei. Impressively, the HTBs endow Cu with excellent electrocatalytic performance for direct nitrate&#8208;ammonia conversion, superior to that of Cu with a single&#8208;oriented TB and without TB. We discover that the HTBs induce the formation of compressive strains, thereby creating a synergistic effect of TBs and strains to efficiently tune the binding energies of Cu with nitrogen intermediates (i.e., NO2*) and thus promote the tandem reaction process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and subsequent NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates the crucial role of HTBs for boosting electrocatalysis via the synergistic effect of TBs and strains.

         <title>Transient Mild Photothermia Improves Therapeutic Performance of Oral Nanomedicines with Enhanced Accumulation in The Colitis Mucosa</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, we constructed high&#8208;performance pluronic F127 (P127)&#8208;modified gold shell (AuS)&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR). Under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the resultant P127&#8208;AuS@CURs generated transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8764;42&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitated their penetration through colonic mucus and favored multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieved intracellular oxidative stress, improved wound healing, and reduced immune responses by polarizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;type macrophages to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating P127&#8208;AuS@CURs plus intestinal intra&#8208;lumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127&#8208;AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevated the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites could also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with anti&#8208;oxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intra&#8208;lumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.

&lt;p&gt;The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, we constructed high-performance pluronic F127 (P127)-modified gold shell (AuS)-polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR). Under near-infrared irradiation, the resultant P127-AuS@CURs generated transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8764;42&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitated their penetration through colonic mucus and favored multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieved intracellular oxidative stress, improved wound healing, and reduced immune responses by polarizing the pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2-type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel-encapsulating P127-AuS@CURs plus intestinal intra-lumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127-AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevated the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/i&gt;), whose metabolites could also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and wound healing.

         <title>Communicating Supraparticles to Enable Perceptual, Information&#8208;Providing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging concept of communicating supraparticles (CSPs), i.e., (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized information providing additives, is presented. Their functional signal characteristics comprise an identification signature and stimuli&#8208;recorder features. Integration of customized CSPs into materials turns them from passive objects into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. Upon interrogation of CSPs, digitally associated information on the hosting material and its intactness is obtained on demand.








Abstract
Materials are the fundament of the physical world, whereas information and its exchange are the centerpieces of the digital world. Their fruitful synergy offers countless opportunities for realizing desired digital transformation processes in the physical world of materials. Yet, to date, a perfect connection between these worlds is missing. From the perspective, this can be achieved by overcoming the paradigm of considering materials as passive objects and turning them into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. This matter is capable of communicating associated digitally stored information, for example, its origin, fate, and material type as well as its intactness on demand. Herein, the concept of realizing perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter by integrating customizable (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized communicating supraparticles (CSPs) is presented. They are assembled from individual nanoparticulate and/or (macro)molecular building blocks with spectrally differentiable signals that are either robust or stimuli&#8208;susceptible. Their combination yields functional signal characteristics that provide an identification signature and one or multiple stimuli&#8208;recorder features. This enables CSPs to communicate associated digital information on the tagged material and its encountered stimuli histories upon signal readout anywhere across its life cycle. Ultimately, CSPs link the materials and digital worlds with numerous use cases thereof, in particular fostering the transition into an age of sustainability.

         <title>Bendable Silicene Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of 2D silicene into bendable membranes allows investigating its optothermal and piezoresistive properties when external strain is applied on a micro and macroscale, thus representing an advance toward a new generation of flexible and fully silicon&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Due to their superior mechanical properties, 2D&#160;materials have gained interest as active layers in flexible devices co&#8208;integrating electronic, photonic, and straintronic functions altogether. To this end, 2D bendable membranes compatible with the technological process standards and endowed with large&#8208;scale uniformity are highly desired. Here, it is reported on the realization of bendable membranes based on silicene layers (the 2D form of silicon) by means of a process in which the layers are fully detached from the native substrate and transferred onto arbitrary flexible substrates. The application of macroscopic mechanical deformations induces a strain&#8208;responsive behavior in the Raman spectrum of silicene. It is also shown that the membranes under elastic tension relaxation are prone to form microscale wrinkles displaying a local generation of strain in the silicene layer consistent with that observed under macroscopic mechanical deformation. Optothermal Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a curvature&#8208;dependent heat dispersion in silicene wrinkles. Finally, as compelling evidence of the technological potential of the silicene membranes, it is demonstrated that they can be readily introduced into a lithographic process flow resulting in the definition of flexible device&#8208;ready architectures, a piezoresistor, and thus paving the way to a viable advance in a fully silicon&#8208;compatible technology framework.

&lt;p&gt;Due to their superior mechanical properties, 2D&#160;materials have gained interest as active layers in flexible devices co-integrating electronic, photonic, and straintronic functions altogether. To this end, 2D bendable membranes compatible with the technological process standards and endowed with large-scale uniformity are highly desired. Here, it is reported on the realization of bendable membranes based on silicene layers (the 2D form of silicon) by means of a process in which the layers are fully detached from the native substrate and transferred onto arbitrary flexible substrates. The application of macroscopic mechanical deformations induces a strain-responsive behavior in the Raman spectrum of silicene. It is also shown that the membranes under elastic tension relaxation are prone to form microscale wrinkles displaying a local generation of strain in the silicene layer consistent with that observed under macroscopic mechanical deformation. Optothermal Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a curvature-dependent heat dispersion in silicene wrinkles. Finally, as compelling evidence of the technological potential of the silicene membranes, it is demonstrated that they can be readily introduced into a lithographic process flow resulting in the definition of flexible device-ready architectures, a piezoresistor, and thus paving the way to a viable advance in a fully silicon-compatible technology framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Marriage of High&#8208;Throughput Gradient Surface Generation With Statistical Learning for the Rational Design of Functionalized Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning, a strategy of biomaterial rational design is developed. The parameter combinations are screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, and the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range are extrapolated. Subsequently, an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface is designed for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities.








Abstract
Functional biomaterial is already an important aspect in modern therapeutics; yet, the design of novel multi&#8208;functional biomaterial is still a challenging task nowadays. When several biofunctional components are present, the complexity that arises from their combinations and interactions will lead to tedious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. In this work, a novel strategy of biomaterial rational design through the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning is presented. Not only can parameter combinations be screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, but also the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range can be extrapolated from the models. The power of the strategy is demonstrated in rationally designing an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities, and its optimality and the best osteointegration promotion are confirmed in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The presented strategy is expected to open up new possibilities in the rational design of biomaterials.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Nanovaccine that Enhances T&#8208;Cell Responses and Efficacy Through Dual Interactions with Dendritic Cells and T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanovaccine comprising cancer cell membrane, monophosphoryl lipid A, and anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (named CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28) activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells by interacting with both dendritic cells (DCs) and na&#239;ve T cells. CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 exhibits higher efficacy in tumor&#8208;specific T cell activation and tumor inhibition than nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or na&#239;ve T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28).








Abstract
Conventional approaches to developing therapeutic cancer vaccines that primarily activate tumor&#8208;specific T cells via dendritic cells (DCs) often demonstrate limited efficacy due to the suboptimal activation of these T cells. To address this limitation, here a therapeutic cancer nanovaccine is developed that enhances T cell responses by interacting with both DCs and T cells. The nanovaccine is based on a cancer cell membrane nanoparticle (CCM&#8208;MPLA) that utilizes monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant. To allow direct interaction between the nanovaccine and tumor&#8208;specific T cells, anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (aCD28) are conjugated onto CCM&#8208;MPLA, resulting in CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28. This nanovaccine activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in both the presence and absence of DCs. Compared with nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28), CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 induces more potent responses of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and exhibits a higher antitumor efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. No differences in T cell activation efficiency and therapeutic efficacy are observed between CCM&#8211;MPLA and CCM&#8211;aCD28. This approach may lead to the development of effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines prepared from autologous cancer cells.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Spatial Confinement in Immune Cell Recruitment and Regeneration of Skin Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that spatial confinement within microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels (130 &#181;m) promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are injectable granular materials comprised of micron sized hydrogel particles (microgels). The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows the authors to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials is studied using small (40&#160;&#181;m), medium (70&#160;&#181;m), and large (130&#160;&#181;m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. This work uncovered that MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.

         <dc:description>
Efficient surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is reported. The merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets and the microdroplet&#8208;assisted coupling of focused laser beams are demonstrated. Moreover, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved by leveraging the selective permeability of droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets.








Abstract
The electrodeless biocompatible manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets remains challenging. The appropriate isolation of electrostatic charges from femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is crucial for electrodeless optoelectronic manipulation based on space&#8208;charge&#8208;density modulation. Here, surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation is proposed, where the surfactant layers self&#8208;assembled at the water&#8211;oil and oil&#8211;Lithium niobate&#160;interfaces are employed to isolate photovoltaic charges. The reduced electrostatic attenuation, remarkable hydrophobicity, and strong electrical breakdown suppression of the surfactant layers enable the stable and swift manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets using &#181;W&#8208;level laser in oil media. By virtue of the surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, a controllable merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets by adjusting the laser illumination intensity and position is realized and the cascading biochemical operations and microreactions of aqueous microdroplets and microdroplet strings are demonstrated. To demonstrate its potential in photonic Micro&#8208;Electro&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;System assemblies, the end coupling of a focused&#8208;laser&#8208;beam into a ZnO microrod leveraging the refraction effect occurring at the water/oil interface is demonstrated. Moreover, because of the selective permeability of the droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved, aiming at constructing multicomponent fluorescent microdroplets with tunable whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode characteristics.

         <title>Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Iron Hydroxy Fluorides as Low&#8208;Cost Lithium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials for Stationary Energy Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors report a facile and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of pyrochlore iron (III) hydroxy fluoride (Pyr&#8208;IHF), enabling to produce Pyr&#8208;IHF at a low cost. Pyr&#8208;IHF&#8208;containing cathodes show superior capacity retention of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Pyrochlore&#8208;type iron (III) hydroxy fluorides (Pyr&#8208;IHF) are appealing low&#8208;cost stationary energy storage materials due to the virtually unlimited supply of their constituent elements, their high energy densities, and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion. However, the prohibitively high costs of synthesis and cathode architecture currently prevent their commercial use in low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective dissolution&#8211;precipitation synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF from soluble iron (III) fluoride precursors is presented. High capacity retention by synthesized Pyr&#8208;IHF of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 is obtained, without elaborate electrode engineering. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction guides the selective synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF such that different water contents can be tested for their effect on the rate capability. Li&#8208;ion diffusion is found to occur in the 3D hexagonal channels of Pyr&#8208;IHF, formed by corner&#8208;sharing FeF6&#8211;x(OH)x octahedra.

         <title>An Integrative Bioorthogonal Nanoengineering Strategy for Dynamically Constructing Heterogenous Tumor Spheroids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) is developed for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with a multivalent click ligand (ClickRod). BONE not only effectively assembled multiple types of cells together, but dynamically regulated cell fates under light stimulation, which together enhanced the development of tumor models.








Abstract
Although tumor models have revolutionized perspectives on cancer aetiology and treatment, current cell culture methods remain challenges in constructing organotypic tumor with in vivo&#8208;like complexity, especially native characteristics, leading to unpredictable results for in vivo responses. Herein, the bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids is developed. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with multivalent click ligand (ClickRod) that is composed of hyaluronic acid&#8208;functionalized gold nanorod carrying dibenzocyclooctyne moieties, resulting in rapid construction of tumor spheroids. BONE can effectively assemble different cancer cells and immune cells together to construct heterogenous tumor spheroids is identified. Particularly, ClickRod exhibited favorable photothermal activity, which precisely promoted cell activity and shaped physiological microenvironment, leading to formation of dynamic features of original tumor, such as heterogeneous cell population and pluripotency, different maturation levels, and physiological gradients. Importantly, BONE not only offered a promising platform for investigating tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, but also improved establishment of subcutaneous xenograft model under mild photo&#8208;stimulation, thereby significantly advancing cancer research. Therefore, the first bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy for developing dynamic tumor models, which have the potential for bridging gaps between in vitro and in vivo research is presented.

         <title>Suppression of Interphase Dissolution Via Solvent Molecule Tuning for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;solvation and thermal&#8208;stable electrolyte is proposed for highly reliable sodium metal batteries via solvent molecule tuning, which induces a low solubility interphase and tailored solvation sheath of Na+ ions. These synergistically minimize the dissolution of solid electrolyte interphase, self&#8208;discharge, and passivate the hyper&#8208;active metallic Na anode at both room and high temperatures.








Abstract
Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion&#8208;solvent binding energy for high&#8208;voltage or low&#8208;temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly&#8208;reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with &#9472;CH2&#9472; units, the low&#8208;solvation tris(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion&#8208;enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower&#8208;solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 &#176;C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the TOP&#160;molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety&#160;sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Integrating Liquification of the Gelated Tumor Interstitium around Nanomedicines with Biconditional GD2&#8208;Targeting for Precise and Safe Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma protein&#8208;like nanomedicine p(EK&#8208;co&#8208;C&#8208;SPA&#8208;ss&#8208;Dox) is developed to enable the integration of all&#8208;barrier&#8208;penetration with active targeting in a single nanodelivery system. Moreover, it is revealed both mechanisms: liquification of surrounding gelated water molecules by zwitterionic p(EK) shell to overcome diffusion barrier in polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor&#160;interstitium, and pH&#8208;triggered targeting to GD2&#8208;overexpressed solid tumor by a negative&#8208;biased zwitterionic shell of nanomedicine.








Abstract
The quick diffusion of nanomedicines in the polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor interstitium and precise active targeting are two major obstacles that have not yet been overcome. Here, a poly(L&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;L&#8208;lysine(EK) (p(EK))&#8208;camouflaged, doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;conjugated nanomedicine is developed to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of zwitterionic shell in synchronous barrier&#8208;penetration and biconditional active targeting. The zwitterionic p(EK) shell liquifies its surrounding water molecules in the polysaccharide gel of tumor&#160;interstitium, leading to five times faster diffusion than the pegylated Doxil with similar size in tumor tissue. Its doped sulfonate groups lead to more precise active tumor&#8208;targeting than disialoganglioside (GD2) antibody by meeting the dual requirements of tumor microenvironment (TME) pH and overexpression of GD2 on tumor. Consequently, the concentrations of the nanomedicine in tumor are always higher than in life&#8208;supported organs in whole accumulation process, reaching over ten times higher Dox in GD2&#8208;overexpressing MCF&#8208;7 tumors than in life&#8208;supporting organs. Furthermore, the nanomedicine also avoids anti&#8208;GD2&#8208;like accumulation in GD2&#8208;expressing kidney in a mouse model. Thus, the nanomedicine expands the therapeutic window of Doxil by more than three times and eliminates tumors with negligible myocardial and acute toxicity. This new insight paves an avenue to design nanodelivery systems for highly precise and safe chemotherapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensors are proposed by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous structure. Self&#8208;decoupled sensing of proximity/pressure/temperature is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics. Negligible signal interference opens up promising paths for multimodal tactile sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile sensors are a crucial part of intelligent human&#8208;machine interaction and collaboration. Simultaneous detection of proximity, pressure, and temperature on a single sensor can greatly promote the safety, interactivity, and compactness of interaction systems. However, severe signal interference and complex decoupling algorithms hinder the actual applications. Here, this work reports a flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensor capable of detecting and decoupling proximity/pressure/temperature by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous sensor. Negligible signal interference is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics, which encodes proximity into capacitance, pressure into light intensity and temperature into resistance. The sensor exhibits a large sensing distance of 225 mm with fast responses for proximity detection, a pressure sensitivity of 0.42 N&#8722;1, and a temperature sensitivity of 7% &#176;C&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a doll equipped with the sensor can accurately discriminate and detect various stimuli, thus achieving safe and immersive interactions with the user. This work opens up promising paths for self&#8208;decoupled multimodal sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.

         <title>Enhanced Operational Stability by Cavity Control of Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to improve the operational stability of single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence is introduced by increasing the emissive layer thickness to the second&#8208;order interference maximum, leading to devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16% and LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 close to 90&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are realized in recent years, but the device lifetime needs further improvement for practical display or lighting applications. In this work, a device design principle is presented by tuning the optical cavity of single&#8208;layer undoped devices, to realize efficient and long&#8208;lived TADF OLEDs. Extending the cavity length to the second&#8208;order interference maximum by increasing the emissive layer thickness broadens the recombination zone, while the optical outcoupling efficiency remains close to that of the thinner first&#8208;order devices. Such a device design leads to efficient and stable single&#8208;layer undoped OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16%, an LT90 of 452&#160;h, and an LT50 of 3693&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is doubled compared to the first&#8208;order counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the widely&#8208;used empirical relation between OLED lifetime and light intensity originates from triplet&#8211;polaron annihilation, resulting in an extrapolated LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of close to 90&#160;000&#160;h, approaching the demands for practical backlight applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Self&#8208;Assembled Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among colloidal quantum wells, self&#8208;assembled of the layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95% is successfully realized. Incorporation of the novel hole transfer layer PF8Cz effectively suppresses electron leakage, which leads to the high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.9%.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) have immense potential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition displays and lighting applications. They offer numerous advantages, such as low cost, high luminous efficiency, narrow emission, and long lifetime. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Nc&#8208;LEDs, typically employing isotropic nanocrystals, is limited by the out&#8208;coupling factor. Here efficient, bright, and long lifetime red Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) are demonstrated. Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among CQWs, a self&#8208;assembled layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95%, resulting in an out&#8208;coupling factor of 37% is successfully spin&#8208;coated. The devices exhibit a remarkable peak EQE of 26.9%, accompanied by a maximum brightness of 55&#160;754&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a long operational lifetime (T95@100&#160;cd m&#8722;2) over 15&#160;000&#160;h. These achievements represent a significant advancement compared to previous studies on Nc&#8208;LEDs incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. The work is expected to provide a general self&#8208;assembly strategy for enhancing the light extraction efficiency of Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Structure Simulation of Methylthiolated Peri&#8208;Condensed Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Identifying Promising Molecular Semiconductors: Discovery of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene Showing Ultrahigh Mobility</title>

Material chemists pursue a way to identify ideal compounds to synthesize without wasting time on synthetic trials. A computational simulation method for crystal structures that identifies a promising molecular semiconductor, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene, among methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is developed. Through experiments, its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors are confirmed to exhibit ultrahigh mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The crystal structures of molecular semiconductors critically affect their carrier&#8208;transport properties. One of the promising crystal structures that afford&#160;high carrier mobility is a brickwork structure recently reported for 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) showing ultrahigh mobility. However, such ultrahigh mobility is not realized in other methylchalocogenolated pyrenes, owing to subtle differences in the molecular positions in their crystal structures. This means that, for developing superior molecular semiconductors, it is desirable to simulate the crystal structure with sufficient quality before time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive synthetic trials. To realize this, a new computational approach is developed to simulate crystal structures of all methylchalocogenolated pyrenes, which is then applied to MT&#8208;pyrene&#8208;related methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including perylene, peropyrene, and terrylene derivatives. Among these, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene (MT&#8208;peropyrene) is expected to show high mobility based on the simulated crystal structures. Thus, MT&#8208;peropyrene is chosen as the synthetic target, and a new peropyrene synthesis method is developed. Thus synthesized MT&#8208;peropyrene has virtually the same crystal structure as the simulated one, and its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors show mobility as high as 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and band&#8208;like transport behaviors. These results indicate that the present crystal&#8208;structure simulation is a powerful tool for exploring promising molecular semiconductors.

This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation system (CE) to synergically passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) are gaining attention due to their easy fabrication, potential to surpass the S&#8208;Q limit, and superior flexibility. However, the low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of wide bandgap (Eg) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have hindered their development. This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation strategy (CE) to passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite. The complementary effect of 4&#8208;trifluoro phenethylammonium (CF3&#8208;PEA+, denoted as CA+) and ethylenediammonium (EDA2+, denoted as EA2+) reduces both electron/hole defect densities and non&#8208;radiative recombination rate, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated POTSCs, the highest PCE to date. Furthermore, unencapsulated POTSCs exhibit excellent photo and thermal stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking or exposure to 60&#160;&#176;C for 500&#160;h. These findings imply that the synergic effect of surface passivators is a promising strategy to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs and corresponding POTSCs.

         <title>Bionic Micro&#8208;Texture Duplication and RE3+ Space&#8208;Selective Doping of Unclonable Silica Nanocomposites for Multilevel Encryption and Intelligent Authentication</title>

         <dc:description>
Multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and soft replication method. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs possess tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information, and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication also is established for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity optical data storage and information encryption by using glass substrates are fascinating due to merits of expanding the functionality and applicability of the optoelectronic field. However, the development of glass substrate&#8208;based multi&#8208;dimensional information encryption methods has remained a challenge because of the high hardness, brittleness and melting temperature of glasses. Herein, inspired by the unique natural structure of plant leaves, multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions (PUFs) fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by using ultraviolet photocurable silica nanocomposites and soft replication method. It is the first time that simultaneous rare&#8208;earth ion (RE3+) space&#8208;selective doping and bionic micro&#8208;texture replication onto transparent glass have been realized, in which the doping position and fluorescence color of RE3+ and height information of unclonable micro&#8208;texture can be selectively equipped for multilevel information encryption. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs are endowed with tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication is also established based on the high robustness and security of MTPLs. Such unclonable bionic MTPLs based on RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and micro&#8208;texture duplication provide an effective and potentially universal approach for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.

         <title>Layered Inorganic Silicate Aerogel Pillared by Nanoclusters for High Temperature Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared with nanoclusters has been developed for high temperature thermal insulation. The well dispersed and strong coupled nanocluster pillars in the interlayers not only significantly decrease the solid thermal conductivity but also maintain the layered structure under high temperatures.








Abstract
Layered inorganic material, with large&#8208;area interlayer surface and interface, provides an essential material platform for constructing new configuration of functional materials. Herein, a layered material pillared with nanoclusters realizing high temperature thermal insulation performance is demonstrated for the first time. Specifically, systematic synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and finite element calculation analysis show that ZrOx nanoclusters served as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to effectively produce porous structures with enough boundary defect while maintaining the layered structure, thereby significantly reducing solid state thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.32&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#8211;573&#160;K). Moreover, the layered inorganic silicate material assembled aerogel also exhibits superior thermal insulation performance from room temperature (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, air conditions) to high temperature (0.187&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 1073&#160;K, air conditions) and largely enhanced compressive strength (42&#160;kPa at 80% compression), which is the best layered material&#8208;based aerogel that has achieved synergistic improvement in thermal and mechanical performance so far. Layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared by nanoclusters will pave a new avenue for the design of advanced thermal insulation materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Polymer Dielectric Constant and Loss via Aluminum Oxo Macrocycle Dopants for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the polymer dielectrics with structurally precise Aluminum Oxo Macrocycles successfully breaks the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. The resulting hybrid dielectrics enable high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, ultralow power synapses (0.9&#160;fJ&#160;spike&#8722;1) with photoelectric synergistic modulation, and flexible artificial neuromorphic retinas capable of recognizing handwritten numbers with a high accuracy of 91.15% via in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing.








Abstract
The dielectric layer is crucial in regulating the overall performance of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), the key component in central processing units, sensors, and displays. Despite considerable efforts being devoted to developing high&#8208;permittivity (k) dielectrics, limited progress is made due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. Here, a solution is presented by designing a monodispersed disk&#8208;shaped Ce&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8208;macrocycle as a dopant in polymer dielectrics. The molecule features a central Ce(III) core connected with eight Al atoms through sixteen bridging hydroxyls and eight 3&#8208;aminophenyl peripheries. The incorporation of this macrocycle in polymer dielectrics results in an up to sevenfold increase in dielectric constants and up to 89% reduction in dielectric loss at low frequencies. Moreover, the leakage&#8208;current densities decrease, and the breakdown strengths are improved by 63%. Relying on the above merits, FETs bearing cluster&#8208;doped polymer dielectrics give near three&#8208;orders source&#8208;drain current increments while maintaining low&#8208;level leakage/off currents, resulting in much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (up to 2.45&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and on/off ratios. This cluster&#8208;doping strategy is generalizable and shows great promise for ultralow&#8208;power photoelectric synapses and neuromorphic retinas. This work successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss and offers a unique design for polymer composite dielectrics.

         <title>Surface Adsorption and Proton Chemistry of Ultra&#8208;Stabilized Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Manganese Dioxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>

A structural stability strategy is proposed to inhibit the dissolution of MnO2 in Zn&#8208;based aqueous devices and provide atomic insights. Meanwhile, the storage mechanism of proton chemistry and Zn ion surface adsorption in CoxMnO2 is revealed. Moreover, the mechanism of the influence of the anode selection on the surface adsorption process is studied.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zinc (Zn) batteries incorporating MnO2 cathodes possess favorable sustainability properties and are being considered for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, unstable electrode structures and unclear charge storage mechanisms limit their development. Here, advanced transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical analysis, and theoretical calculations are utilized to study the working mechanisms of a Zn/MnO2 battery with a Co2+&#8208;stabilized, tunnel&#8208;structured &#945;&#8208;MnO2 cathode (CoxMnO2). It is shown that Co2+ can be pre&#8208;intercalated into &#945;&#8208;MnO2 and occupy the (2&#160;&#215;&#160;2) tunnel structure, which improves the structural stability of MnO2, facilitates the proton diffusion and Zn2+ adsorption on the MnO2 surface upon battery cycling. It is further revealed that for the MnO2 cathode, the charge storage reaction proceeds mainly by proton intercalation with the formation of &#945;&#8208;HyCoxMnO2, and that the anode design (with or without Zn metal) affects the surface adsorption of by&#8208;product Zn4SO4(OH)6&#183;nH2O on MnO2 surface. This work advances the fundamental understanding of rechargeable Zn batteries and also sheds light on efficient electrode modifications toward performance enhancement.

         <title>Regulating Isolated&#8208;Molecular and Aggregated&#8208;State Phosphorescence for Multicolor Afterglow by Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general principle is proposed to design color&#8208;tunable phosphorescence with isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state emitting centers. The isolated&#8208;molecular phosphorescence lifetime in 1,3,6,8&#8208;pyrene tetra sulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTA)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) film can reach 1735.71 ms with minimal influence on aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence after photo&#8208;activation. Moreover, multi&#8208;color afterglow display, ultraviolet detection, and multilevel information encryption are demonstrated based on these materials.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Herein, a new type of flexible films is fabricated by doping amphipathic pyrene tetrasulfonic acid sodium salts into amorphous poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, which enables the realization of color&#8208;tunable UOP spanning from orange&#8208;red to green after excitation light is switched off. Interestingly, precise control of the proportion of isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence is demonstrated for colorful afterglow using photo&#8208;activation. An increase in the dynamic phosphorescence lifetime of isolated molecules is observed from 894.75 to 1735.71 ms following an 8 min irradiation under ambient conditions. The photo&#8208;activation, however, showed little influence on aggreated&#8208;state phosphorescence. This flexible and processable film exhibits versatile applications in multicolor afterglow displays, ultraviolet detection, multilevel information encryption, etc. This study not only provides a strategy for the rational regulation of UOP colors but also expands the application potential of color&#8208;tunable UOP materials.

         <title>A Simple and Versatile Approach for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Transition Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles from Metal Chloride Complexes and P(SiMe3)3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal phosphide nanoparticles are prepared under mild conditions following a synthetic approach involving the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds in the by&#8208;product SiClMe3 acts as a driving force for the reaction. The simplicity and versatility of this approach is demonstrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide, cobalt phosphide, and molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles.








Abstract
Metal chloride complexes react with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine under mild condition to produce metal phosphide (TMP) nanoparticles (NPs), and chlorotrimethylsilane as a byproduct. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds that are stronger than the starting M&#8208;Cl bonds acts as a driving force for the reaction. The potential of this strategy is illustrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide NPs using [RuCl2(cymene)] and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine at 35 &#176;C. Characterization with a combination of techniques including electron microscopy (EM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, evidences the formation of small (diameter of 1.3&#160;nm) and amorphous NPs with an overall Ru50P50 composition. Interestingly, these NPs can be easily immobilized on functional support materials, which is of great interest for potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. Mo50P50 and Co50P50 NPs can also be synthesized following the same strategy. This approach is simple and versatile and paves the way toward the preparation of a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Engineering In Situ Catalytic Cleaning Membrane Via Prebiotic&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Mineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy is developed for aqueous dip&#8208;coating of catalytic nanomaterials onto the hydrophobic polymeric membrane at room temperature. The biomimetic mineralized superhydrophilic membrane enables the operando flux recovery beyond 99.8% and a ninefold higher flux recovery compared to the control one, attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;driven membrane separation promises a sustainable energy&#8208;water nexus but is hindered by ubiquitous fouling. Natural systems evolved from prebiotic chemistry offer a glimpse of creative solutions. Herein, a prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile (AMN)/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization method is reported for universally engineering a superhydrophilic hierarchical MnO2 nanocoating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with exceptional catalytic cleaning ability. Green hydrogen peroxide catalytically triggered in&#8208;situ cleaning of the mineralized membrane and enabled operando flux recovery to reach 99.8%. The mineralized membrane exhibited a 9&#8208;fold higher recovery compared to the unmineralized membrane, which is attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling. Electron density differences derived from the precursor interaction during mediated mineralization unveiled an electron&#8208;rich bell&#8208;like structure with an inner electron&#8208;deficient Mn core. This work paves the way to construct multifunctional engineered materials for energy&#8208;efficient water treatment as well as for diverse promising applications in catalysis, solar steam generation, biomedicine, and beyond.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;component organic photodetectors using non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with strong donor/acceptor character are demonstrated. Efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states by electric field and CTE dissociation due to large interfacial energetic offset induced by high quadrupole moments of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors.

A bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) blend is commonly used as the photoactive layer in organic photodetectors (OPDs) to utilize the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial energetic offset for exciton dissociation. However, this strategy often complicates optimization procedures, raising serious concerns over device processability, reproducibility, and stability. Herein, highly efficient OPDs fabricated with single&#8208;component organic semiconductors are demonstrated via solution&#8208;processing. The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with strong intrinsic D/A character are used as the photoactive layer, where the emissive intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states are formed within &lt;1&#160;ps, and efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of these CTE states by reverse bias. Y6 and IT&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPDs show excellent OPD performances, low dark current density (&#8776;10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high responsivity (&#8805;0.15 A W&#8722;1), high specific detectivity (&gt;1012 Jones), and fast photo&#8208;response time (&lt;10 &#181;s), comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art BHJ OPDs. Together with strong CTE state quenching by electric field, these excellent OPD performances are also attributed to the high quadrupole moments of NFA molecules, which can lead to large interfacial energetic offset for efficient CTE dissociation. This work opens a new way to realize efficient OPDs using single&#8208;component systems via solution&#8208;processing and provides important molecular design rules.

         <title>Augmenting Immunotherapy via Bioinspired MOF&#8208;Based ROS Homeostasis Disruptor with Nanozyme&#8208;Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>

A smart nanozyme with multiple activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione oxidase, is designed to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors and activate host immunity through nanozyme&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. After synergy with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody, the outstanding efficacy of immunotherapy is acquired by the guide of tumor microenvironment&#8208;activated fluorescence imaging /1H/19F dual&#8208;nuclei magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Despite its remarkable clinical breakthroughs, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy remains limited by the insufficient immune response in the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. Nanozyme&#8208;based antitumor catalysis is associated with precise immune activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a cascade&#8208;augmented nanoimmunomodulator (CMZM) with multienzyme&#8208;like activities, which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), that dissociates under an acidic and abundant GSH TME, is proposed for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) enhanced immunotherapy. Vigorous multienzyme&#8208;like activities can not only produce O2 to alleviate hypoxia and promote the polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages, but also generate ROS (&#8226;OH and 1O2) and deplete GSH in the TME to expose necrotic cell fragments and reverse immunosuppressive TME by eliciting the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Therefore, inhibitory effects on both primary and distant tumors are achieved through synergy with an &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody. This cascade multienzyme&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a smart strategy for highly efficient ICB immunotherapy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors by revising immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Understanding Microstructural Development of Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>

The enhanced interaction between 4&#8242;&#8208;cyanogroup&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8722;4&#8208;acyl acrylate and PbI2 during annealing leads to the formation of a new intermediate complex, which not only induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth but also increases diffusion activation energy, leading to delayed crystallization. Therefore, the optimized device has high efficiency (24.53%) and excellent stability (maintaining 89% of the initial efficiency after 6600 h aging in ambient).








Abstract
Solution crystallization in film devices has attracted broad interest from various fields such as perovskite solar cells. However, the detailed perovskite crystallization kinetics remain unclear due to the difficulty of in situ observation of grain cluster growth during annealing. This article presents the development of an in situ laser scanning confocal polarized microscopy with a temperature&#8208;controlled stage to observe nucleation and growth of perovskite crystal clusters. It is found that enhanced interactions by a liquid crystal with perovskite form a new intermediate complex that induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth according to Avrami equation. The retarded cluster growth (63&#160;nm s&#8722;1) originates from enlarged diffusion activation energy 40&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 compared with 152&#160;nm s&#8722;1 and 37&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the Control film during annealing. Finally, the optimized perovskite films with enhanced crystallographic and optical characteristics are applied in solar cells to achieve a champion efficiency of 24.53% with open circuit voltage of 1.172&#160;V and fill factor of 82.78%. The bare device without any protection maintains 89% of its initial efficiency after 6600&#160;h of aging in ambient environment. This work implies that the in situ observation using fluorescence microscopy is a critical for understanding of crystallization kinetics in film devices.

         <title>Enantioselective Oral Absorption of Molecular Chiral Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l&#8208;CMSNs) performs better in the sequential oral absorption processes than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (Dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts via multiple chiral recognition mechanisms, and ultimately undertaking the responsibility of efficient oral drug delivery. These findings validate the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.








Abstract
Inspired by the unique pharmacological effects of chiral drugs in the asymmetrical body environments, it is assumed that the chirality of nanocarriers is also a key factor to determine their oral adsorption efficiency, apart from their size, shape, etc. Herein, l/d&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l/d&#8208;CMSNs) are fabricated via a one&#8208;pot cocondensation method, and focused on whether the oral adsorption of nanocarriers will be benefited from their chirality. It is found that l&#8208;CMSN performed better in the sequential oral absorption processes, including mucus permeation, mucosa bio&#8208;adhesion, cellular uptake, intestinal transport and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) retention, than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts. The multiple chiral recognition mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated following simple differential adsorption on biointerfaces, wherein electrostatic interaction is the dominant energy. During the oral delivery task, l&#8208;CMSN, which is proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible, and biodegradable, is efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72&#8211;2.05&#8208;fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helps the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32&#8211;27.03&#8208;times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger antitumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

         <title>1D Magnetic MX3 Single&#8208;Chains (M = Cr, V and X = Cl, Br, I)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I) confined in carbon nanotubes are investigated. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique 1D face&#8208;sharing octahedron MX3 structure. Charge transfer from carbon nanotube to MX3 single&#8208;chain plays a critical role in stabilizing the chain structures.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in reduced dimensions are not only excellent platforms for fundamental studies of magnetism, but they play crucial roles in technological advances. The discovery of intrinsic magnetism in monolayer 2D van der Waals systems has sparked enormous interest, but the single&#8208;chain limit of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials has been largely unexplored. This paper reports on a family of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I), prepared in fully&#8208;isolated fashion within the protective cores of carbon nanotubes. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique structures that differ from the well&#8208;known 2D honeycomb lattice MX3 structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal charge&#8208;driven reversible magnetic phase transitions.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Electronic Structure Modulation on MnO2 Nanosheet by Ir Incorporation for Efficient Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal approach is adopted to fabricate a new layered and strained Mn0.98Ir0.02O2 nanosheet electrocatalyst (sl&#8208;Mn0.98Ir0.02O2) with optimized electronic structure induced by Ir incorporation. The obtained strained nanosheets have only trace amount of Ir loading and exhibit the highest iridium mass activity (5681 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV).








Abstract
Oxygen electrochemistry plays a key role in renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but its slow kinetics limits the performance and the commercialization of such devices. Here, a strained MnO2 nanosheet induced by Ir incorporation is developed with optimized electronic structure by a simple hydrothermal method. With the incorporation of Ir, the strain induces elongated Mn&#9472;O bond length, and thereby tuning the electronic structure to favor the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The obtained catalyst exhibits an excellent mass activity of 5681&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4, and reaches 50 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of only 240 and 277&#160;mV, respectively. The catalyst is also stable even at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. Using the nanosheet as the OER catalyst and the Pt/C as the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer achieves 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only a cell voltage of 1.453&#160;V for overall water splitting in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. This strategy enables the material with high feasibility for practical applications on hydrogen production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Conversion of Photodetector and Neuromorphic Vision Sensor via Bias Voltage Regulation on a Single Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN device is fabricated. According to the manipulation of the ionization and de&#8208;ionization processe of oxygen vacancies within the Ga2O3, the device shows fast photoresponse at low voltages and persistent photoconductivity behavior at high voltages. Accordingly, various functions of the photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor are achieved by one device and switched via bias voltage regulation.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS) on a single device faces a great challenge, due to the inherent speed discrepancy in their photoresponse characteristics. In this work, a trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN back&#8208;to&#8208;back double heterojunction array device is fabricated to enable the advanced functionalities of both devices on a single device. Interestingly, the device shows fast photoresponse and persistent photoconductivity behavior at low and high voltages, respectively, through the modulation of oxygen vacancy ionization and de&#8208;ionization processes in Ga2O3. Consequently, the role of the optoelectronic device can be altered between the photodetector and NVS by simply adjusting the magnitude of bias voltage. As a photodetector, the device is able to realize fast optical imaging and optical communication functions. On the other hand, the device exhibits outstanding image sensing, image memory, and neuromorphic visual pre&#8208;processing as an NVS. The utilization of NVS for image pre&#8208;processing leads to a noticeable enhancement in both recognition accuracy and efficiency. The results presented in this work not only offer a new avenue to obtain complex functionality on a single optoelectronic device but also provide opportunities to implement advanced robotic vision systems and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>A &#8220;Trinity&#8221; Design of Li&#8208;O2 Battery Engaging the Slow&#8208;Release Capsule of Redox Mediators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of Li&#8208;O2 battery is initiated by employing hollow cobalt metal organic frameworks impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously for cathode catalyst, anode protection, and slow&#8208;release redox mediators (RM). Mechanistic investigations assert the critical role of RM&#8208;mediated solution growth of crystalline Li2O2 to greatly boost both the capacity and cycling reversibility.








Abstract
Nonaqueous Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) represents one of the promising next&#8208;gen energy storage solutions owing to its ultrahigh energy density but suffers from problems such as high charging overpotential, slow redox kinetics, Li anode corrosion, etc., calling for a systemic optimization of the battery configuration and structural components. Herein, an ingenious &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of LOB is initiated by implementing a hollowed cobalt metal organic framework (MOF) impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously as the cathode catalyst, anode protection layer, and slow&#8208;release capsule of redox mediators, so as to systemically address issues of impeded mass transport and redox kinetics on the cathode, dendrite growth, and surface corrosion on the anode, as well as limited intermediate solubility in the low donor&#8208;number (DN) solvent. As a result of the systemic effort, the LOB constructed demonstrates an ultralow discharge/charge polarization of 0.2&#160;V, prolonged cycle life of 1244&#160;h and total discharge capacity of 28.41&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations attribute the superb LOB performance to the redox&#8208;mediated solution growth mechanism of crystalline Li2O2 with both enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility. This study offers a paradigm in designing smart materials to raise the performance bar of Li&#8208;O2 battery toward realistic applications.

Here, chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) modified by chiral penicillamine (Pen) molecules with g&#8208;factor of &#8776;2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm are fabricated, and these SPs act as high&#8208;quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Therein, the transverse relaxation efficiency and T2&#8208;MRI results demonstrated chiral Fe3O4 SPs have a r2 relaxivity of 157.39 &#177; 2.34 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs and 136.21 &#177; 1.26 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs due to enhanced electronic transition dipole moment for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs compared with L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. The in vivo MRI results show that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibit two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs, which enhances targeted enrichment in tumor tissue, such as prostate cancer, melanoma and brain glioma tumors. Notably, it is found that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs have 7.7&#8208;fold higher affinity for the tumor cell surface receptor cluster&#8208;of&#8208;differentiation 47 (CD47) than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. These findings uncover that chiral Fe3O4 SPs act as a highly effective MRI contrast agent for targeting and imaging broad tumors, thus accelerating the practical application of chiral nanomaterials and deepening the understanding of chirality in biological and non&#8208;biological environments.

         <dc:description>
The isomerized solid additive engineering based on volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers is empolyed to achieve a remarkable PCE of 18.72% for all&#8208;PSCs processed with green solvent. More importantly, the all&#8208;PSCs fabricated with this approach offer excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, and demonstrate exceptional thermal stability with extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have exhibited remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%. However, the utilization of hazardous solvents and nonvolatile liquid additives poses challenges for eco&#8208;friendly commercialization, resulting in&#160;the trade&#8208;off between device efficiency and operation stability. Herein, an innovative approach based on isomerized solid additive engineering is proposed, employing volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers to modulate intermolecular interactions and facilitate molecular stacking within the photoactive layers. Through elucidating the underlying principles of the DTT&#8208;induced polymer assembly on molecular level, a PCE of 18.72% is achieved for devices processed with environmentally benign solvents, ranking it among the highest record values for eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs. Significantly, such superiorities of the DTT&#8208;isomerized strategy afford excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, offering a promising pathway for industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing of all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, these devices demonstrate enhanced thermal stability with a promising extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h, further bolstering their potential for sustainable technological advancement.

         <title>Precisely Inhibiting Excessive Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis to Efficiently Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Oral Pifithrin&#8208;&#945; Embedded Nanomedicine (OPEN)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
OPEN can effectively target IBD lesions and slowly release PFT&#945;. OPEN specifically targets p53 signaling, inhibits excessive apoptosis of IECs in IBD lesions, and plays a role in promoting intestinal epithelial barrier repair, anti&#8208;inflammation, and regulating intestinal microbiome, while having good biocompatibility.








The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has seriously affected the life quality of patients. IBD develops due to excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, disrupting the gut barrier, colonizing harmful bacteria, and initiating persistent inflammation. The current therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation are limited. Although IBD can be treated significantly by directly preventing IEC apoptosis, achieving this therapeutic approach remains challenging. Accordingly, the authors are the first to develop an oral pifithrin&#8208;&#945; (PFT&#945;, a highly specific p53 inhibitor) embedded nanomedicine (OPEN) to effectively treat IBD by inhibiting excessive IEC apoptosis. As a major hub for various stressors, p53 is a central determinant of cell fate, and its inhibition can effectively reduce excessive IEC apoptosis. The tailored OPEN can precisely inhibit the off&#8208;target and inactivation resulting from PFT&#945; entry into the bloodstream. Subsequently, it persistently targets IBD lesions with high specificity to inhibit the pathological events caused by excessive IEC apoptosis. Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first&#8208;line drugs 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.

         <title>Charge Density Wave Order and Electronic Phase Transitions in a Dilute d&#8208;Band Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of charge density wave (CDW) order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions are reported in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the role of electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions. This work opens new opportunites for exploring CDW&#160;physics in the dilute filling limit and developing novel electronic devices.








Abstract
As one of the most fundamental physical phenomena, charge density wave (CDW) order predominantly occurs in metallic systems such as quasi&#8208;1D metals, doped cuprates, and transition metal dichalcogenides, where it is well understood in terms of Fermi surface nesting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanisms. On the other hand, CDW phenomena in semiconducting systems, particularly at the low carrier concentration limit, are less common and feature intricate characteristics, which often necessitate the exploration of novel mechanisms, such as electron&#8211;hole coupling or Mott physics, to explain. In this study, an approach combining electrical transport, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations is used to investigate CDW order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. These experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the observed CDW order and phase transitions in BaTiS3 may be attributed to both electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions in the system. This work highlights BaTiS3 as a unique platform to explore CDW physics and novel electronic phases in the dilute filling limit and opens new opportunities for developing novel electronic devices.

         <title>Reshaping Zinc Plating/Stripping Behavior by Interfacial Water Bonding for High&#8208;Utilization&#8208;Rate Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable bacterial cellulose (BC) hydrogel electrolyte is adopted to bond interface water molecules to suppress water activity and alleviate water&#8208;induced side&#160;reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Due to the interface water bonding effect, symmetric Zn cells assemble with the BC hydrogel electrolyte cycle stably and deliver a high utilization rate (&gt;85%) of Zn anode under harsh test conditions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices; however, severe parasitic reactions lead to the exacerbated production of Zn dendrites that decrease the utilization rate of Zn anodes. Decreasing the electrolyte content and regulating the water activity are efficient means to address these issues. Herein, this work shows that limiting the aqueous electrolyte and bonding water to bacterial cellulose (BC) can suppress side reactions and regulate stable Zn plating/stripping. This approach makes it possible to use less electrolyte and limited Zn foil. A symmetric Zn cell assembles with the hydrogel electrolyte with limited electrolyte (electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio E/C = 1.0 g (Ah)&#8722;1) cycled stably at a current density of 6.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and achieved a capacity of 6.5 mA h cm&#8722;2 and depth of discharge of 85%. Full cells with the BC hydrogel electrolyte delivers a discharge capacity of 212 mA h cm&#8722;2 and shows a capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work offers new fundamental insights into the effect of restricting water to reshape the Zn plating/stripping process and provides a route for designing novel hydrogel electrolytes to better stabilize and efficiently utilize the Zn anodes.

         <title>Liquid Crystals Doped with Chiral Fluorescent Polymer: Multi&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Fluorescence and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with High Dissymmetry Factor and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel type of emissive chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) is constructed by doping chiral fluorescent helical polymer into nematic liquid crystals. Intense multi&#8208;color circular polarized luminescence and circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence are achieved, with high dissymmetry factors (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 and &#8722;1.57, respectively. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is further realized based on multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of N*&#8208;LCs.








Abstract
Chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) can tremendously amplify circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Doped emissive N*&#8208;LCs have been substantially explored. However, their CPL performances still need to be improved, mainly due to the unsatisfying helical twisting power (HTP) of commonly used chiral fluorescent dopants. Chiral fluorescent helical polymers (CFHPs) have outstanding optical activity and CPL performance. The present contribution reports the first success in constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs by doping CFHP into nematic liquid crystals (5CB, N&#8208;LCs). The helical assembly structures of N*&#8208;LCs effectively amplify the CPL signals of the CFHP. Owing to the high HTP of CFHP, the selective reflection band of N*&#8208;LC can be adjusted to fully cover its emission band. A nearly pure CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 is realized at 9&#160;wt% doping concentration. Taking advantage of the selective reflection mechanism, multi&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs with high glum are fabricated via further adding achiral fluorophores. Also noticeably, circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with glum up to &#8722;1.57 is achieved. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is demonstrated by exploiting multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of the created N*&#8208;LCs. The established strategy for constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs provides a platform for future exploring of CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs.

         <title>3D Printing of High Viscosity UV&#8208;Curable Resin for Highly Stretchable and Resilient Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 3D printed elastomer parts are prepared by using a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization system from high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin. After thermal treatment, the cross&#8208;linking polymerization of the chain extender and the unblocked isocyanate functional group effectively increases the molecular weight of the elastomer rendering a high mechanical performance (&#8776;a strain of 1600% and a stress of &#8776;26&#160;MPa).








Abstract
Elastomers prepared via vat photopolymerizationus ually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties owing to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure. Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV&#8208;curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high&#8208;viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer&#8208;dominated UV&#8208;curable resin via a dual&#8208;curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D&#8208;printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application scope of vat photopolymerization to new fields.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Expendable Leveler as Electrolyte Additive Enabling Homogenous Lithium Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leveling agent of 4,6&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Mercaptopyrimidine (DMP) typically used in the copper electroplating industry is selected as a non&#8208;expendable electrolyte additive for Li metal anodes. The DMP leveler successfully adjusts the solvation structure due to strong coordination ability and absorbs on Li metal forming a functional molecular layer. Consequently, the Li deposition is flat, dendrite&#8208;free, and less by&#8208;products from interfacial side reactions.








Abstract
Li metal anodes are extensively studied owing to their unparalleled advantages in achieving high energy density. However, safety issues originating from dendritic Li growth are always a huge hindrance for applications in Li metal batteries (LMBs). In this study, a functional additive, 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (DMP), which is a typical leveler in the copper electroplating industry, is selected to suppress Li dendrite formation. Various Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries are systematically investigated and they show stable performances, such as excellent cycling stability above 800&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Li cells and 400 cycles with high coulombic efficiencies (CEs &gt;98%) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive verification of the protective mechanism induced by the DMP leveling agent shows that the leveler updated the Li+ solvation structure and occupied the inner Helmholtz plane of the Li anode. The planar DMP molecular layer absorbed on the surface of the Li metal can suppress side reactions and modify the Li deposition behavior via steric hindrance, inducing homogeneous Li deposition. Interestingly, the DMP leveler does not participate in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase. This study can stimulate further ideas on non&#8208;depleting but effective levelers as electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

The ultrasonic induced&#8208;cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at grain boundaries. As a result, the CuS with nitrate precursor under USF (UNCu) shows the optimum effective absorption bandwidth of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is 228.6% more than the WUNCu (absence of USF).








Abstract
Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that are not applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. One reason is that the lack of a response mechanism for the materials to USF hinders the expansion of their EMW absorption performance. Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions are&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF. The ultrasonic&#8208;induced cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at the grain boundaries (GBs). Furthermore, the S defects at the GBs are&#160;easily oriented and arranged, allowing the polarization relaxation retention to be maintained at 10&#160;wt%. Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF shows an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF. CuS with a chloride precursor also achieves an EAB of 3.92&#160;GHz, even at a considerably low filler ratio. Thus, this&#160;study demonstrates the response mechanism of diverse anions to the USF for the first time and provides a novel technique to optimize the EMW absorption performance of semiconductors.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>

A wet&#8208;adaptive electronic skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is developed, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. This WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously achieves superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property, enabling stable device performance and comfortable wearing for underwater electrocardiogram detection and human&#8208;machine interactions.








Abstract
Skin electronics provides remarkable opportunities for non&#8208;invasive and long&#8208;term monitoring of a wide variety of biophysical and physiological signals that are closely related to health, medicine, and human&#8208;machine interactions. Nevertheless, conventional skin electronics fabricated on elastic thin films are difficult to adapt to the wet microenvironments of the skin: Elastic thin films are non&#8208;permeable, which block the skin perspiration; Elastic thin films are difficult to adhere to wet skin; Most skin electronics are difficult to work underwater. Here, a Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is reported, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. While the electronic functionality is determined by the electrode design, this WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously offers superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property. The WADE&#8208;skin can rapidly adhere to human skin after contact for a few seconds and stably maintain the adhesion over weeks even under wet conditions, without showing any negative effect to the skin health. The use of WADE&#8208;skin is demonstrated for the stable recording of electrocardiogram during intensive sweating as well as underwater activities, and as the strain sensor for the underwater operation of virtual reality&#8208;mediated human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Processable Hydroxide Ink with Oriented Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpoints the inner relationship between the microstructure and rheology as well as the mechanical engineering, achieving the fabrication of hydroxide production including continuous fiber, meter&#8208;level film, and free&#8208;standing aerogel. Also, the enlarge&#8208;batch fabrication (capacity of 10&#160;L) of hydroxide is successfully executed, paving the way for further practical application of hydroxide&#8208;based production in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
The intrinsic poor processability of hydroxide originating from the structural property greatly hinders their practical applications. Here, a processable highly&#8208;concentrated nickel/cobalt double hydroxide ink is reported to meet the practical demand. The inner nanoflakes in ink possess a high width/thickness ratio (&gt;100), which endows the highly&#8208;concentrated ink (60&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) with liquid&#8208;like rheology properties. Further, the elliptical diffusive arc in small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering pattern and porous and ordered alignment morphology in cryogenic temperature scanning electron microscopy confirms the locally oriented arrangement of nanoflakes in the ink. Benefiting from this interior&#8208;ordered structure, the ink can be processed into meter&#8208;level film, continuous yarn, and rigid and free&#8208;standing aerogel, respectively. In particular, the films can be used as electrodes directly in aqueous zinc ion batteries and deliver a favorable capacity (382&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 @ 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) as well as long cycle stability (capacity retention rate of 88% @ 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 after 400&#160;cycles). Moreover, the enlarged&#8208;batched fabrication with the introduction of efficient thermal conduction in a 10&#160;L reactor is also carried out successfully. These results clarify the inner relationship between microstructure&#8208;rheology and mechanical engineering for hydroxides, thus paving the way to develop hydroxide&#8208;based products for future practical applications.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Transfer Pathway to Avoid Capacity Fading of Nano Si Through Sub&#8208;Nano Scale Interfused SiOx/C Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiOx/C coating has electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility, enabling a fast and stable lithium diffusion pathway towards encapsulated Si. A fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration distinction are realized, endowing the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite anode material with a high capacity and prolonged lifespan.








Abstract
Si nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a promising high&#8208;capacity anode material owing to their ability to prevent mechanical failure from drastic volume change during (de)lithiation. However, upon cycling, a quick capacity fading is still observed for Si NPs, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that the quick capacity fading is mainly caused by the generation of dead (electrochemically inert) Si with blocked electron conductivity in a densely composited Si/SEI (solid electrolyte interface) hybrid. This is due to the combined influence of electrolyte&#8208;related side reactions and the accompanied agglomeration of Si NPs. A compact, sub&#8208;nano scale interfused SiOx/C composite coating onto the Si NPs is constructed, and a highly stabilized electrochemistry is achieved upon long cycling. The SiOx/C coating with electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility enables a fast and stable lithium ion/electron dual diffusion pathway towards the encapsulated Si. With fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration feature, the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite demonstrates a stable high capacity. This work unravels new perspectives on the capacity fading of Si NPs and provides an effective encapsulating method to remedy the structure degradation and capacity fading of nano Si.

Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles
In article number 2306621, Alexis Bordet, Walter Leitner, and co&#8208;workers report the preparation of metal phosphide nanoparticles through the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. In the reaction, the release of the by&#8208;product SiClMe3 acts as a driving force. The exploitation of the strength of the Si&#8211;Cl bond as compared to many metal&#8211;Cl bonds is expected to provide easy access to a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles.

Mineralization Strategies
In article number 2306626, Xiaobin Yang, Seth B. Darling, Lu Shao, and co&#8208;workers report an aminomalononitrile/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy, inspired by prebiotic chemistry, for engineering a superhydrophilic coating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with robust catalytic cleaning ability. The entire fabrication of these coatings is performed in an aqueous buffer system and at ambient conditions. The biomimetic mineralized membranes exhibit substantially improved recovery after exposure to a fouling environment.

         <title>Breaking the Activity and Stability Bottlenecks of Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advance in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically reviewed, including reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and operando characterizations, aiming to shed light on the rational design of advanced catalysts for the large&#8208;scale application of OER in various energy conversion and storage systems such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone reaction for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, OER catalysis in acids suffers from extra sluggish kinetics due to the additional step of water dissociation along with its multiple electron transfer processes. Furthermore, OER catalysts often suffer from poor stability in harsh acidic electrolytes due to the severe dissolution/corrosion processes. The development of active and stable OER catalysts in acids is highly demanded. Here, &#160;the recent advances in OER electrocatalysis in acids are reviewed and the key strategies are summarized to overcome the bottlenecks of activity and stability for both noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based and noble metal&#8208;free catalysts, including i) morphology engineering, ii) composition engineering, and iii) defect engineering. Recent achievements in operando characterization and theoretical calculations are summarized which provide an unprecedented understanding of the OER mechanisms regarding active site identification, surface reconstruction, and degradation/dissolution pathways.

     alt="Breaking the Activity and Stability Bottlenecks of Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest advance in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically reviewed, including reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and operando characterizations, aiming to shed light on the rational design of advanced catalysts for the large-scale application of OER in various energy conversion and storage systems such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone reaction for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as water splitting, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, OER catalysis in acids suffers from extra sluggish kinetics due to the additional step of water dissociation along with its multiple electron transfer processes. Furthermore, OER catalysts often suffer from poor stability in harsh acidic electrolytes due to the severe dissolution/corrosion processes. The development of active and stable OER catalysts in acids is highly demanded. Here, &#160;the recent advances in OER electrocatalysis in acids are reviewed and the key strategies are summarized to overcome the bottlenecks of activity and stability for both noble-metal-based and noble metal-free catalysts, including i) morphology engineering, ii) composition engineering, and iii) defect engineering. Recent achievements in operando characterization and theoretical calculations are summarized which provide an unprecedented understanding of the OER mechanisms regarding active site identification, surface reconstruction, and degradation/dissolution pathways. Finally, views are offered on the current challenges and opportunities to break the activity&#8211;stability relationships for acidic OER in mechanism understanding, catalyst design, as well as standardized stability and activity evaluation for industrial applications such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Syntheses of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely applied in optoelectronics and material sciences. In the past decade, molecular electrochemistry has emerged as a novel and robust tool for PAHs synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive survey on electrochemical assembly of PAHs largely by the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have surfaced as increasingly viable components in optoelectronics and material sciences. The development of highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tools to prepare PAHs under exceedingly mild conditions constitutes a long&#8208;term goal. Traditional syntheses of PAHs have largely relied on multistep approaches or the conventional Scholl reaction. However, Scholl reactions are largely inefficient with electron&#8208;deficient substrates, require stoichiometric chemical oxidants, and typically occur in the presence of strong acid. In sharp contrast, electrochemistry has gained considerable momentum during the past decade as an alternative for the facile and straightforward PAHs assembly, generally via electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenative annulation, releasing molecular hydrogen as the sole stoichiometric byproduct by the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review provides an overview on the recent and significant advances in the field of electrochemical syntheses of various PAHs until January 2023.

         <title>Bioadhesives with Antimicrobial Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research on bioadhesives is gaining new heights with the incorporation of innovative antimicrobial activity mechanisms. Strategies to achieve antimicrobial activity without compromise from biocompatibility, adhesion and cohesion are being devised. Unique approaches in the application of these bioadhesives and methods to reveal their elusive properties are diversifying. Bioadhesives are coming one step closer to replace many traditional surgical devices in the clinic.








Abstract
Bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties enable easier and safer treatment of wounds as compared to the traditional methods such as suturing and stapling. Composed of natural or synthetic polymers, these bioadhesives seal wounds and facilitate healing while preventing infections through the activity of locally released antimicrobial drugs, nanocomponents, or inherently antimicrobial polers. Although many different materials and strategies are employed to develop antimicrobial bioadhesives, the design of these biomaterials necessitates a prudent approach as achieving all the required properties including optimal adhesive and cohesive properties, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial activity can be challenging. Designing antimicrobial bioadhesives with tunable physical, chemical, and biological properties will shed light on the path for future advancement of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties. In this review, the requirements and commonly used strategies for developing bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties are discussed. In particular, different methods for their synthesis and their experimental and clinical applications on a variety of organs are reviewed. Advances in the design of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties will pave the way for a better management of wounds to increase positive clinical outcomes.

         <title>Soft Functionally Gradient Materials and Structures &#8211; Natural and Manmade: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft functionally gradient materials (FGM) having gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions are ideally suitable to manage interfacial stresses in dissimilar materials used in many emerging technologies for human interaction, such as soft robotics. The critical challenges in material, design, and fabrication methods are discussed in the context of the remarkable examples of natural FGMs.








Abstract
Functionally gradient materials (FGM) have gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions due to local compositional or structural distinctions by design. Traditionally, hard materials (e.g., metals, ceramics) are used to design and fabricate FGMs; however, there is increasing interest in polymer&#8208;based soft and compliant FGMs mainly because of their potential application in the human environment. Soft FGMs are ideally suitable to manage interfacial problems in dissimilar materials used in many emerging devices and systems for human interaction, such as soft robotics and electronic textiles and beyond. Soft systems are ubiquitous in everyday lives; they are resilient and can easily deform, absorb energy, and adapt to changing environments. Here, the basic design and functional principles of biological FGMs and their manmade counterparts are discussed using representative examples. The remarkable multifunctional properties of natural FGMs resulting from their sophisticated hierarchical structures, built from a relatively limited choice of materials, offer a rich source of new design paradigms and manufacturing strategies for manmade materials and systems for emerging technological needs. Finally, the challenges and potential pathways are highlighted to leverage soft materials' facile processability and unique properties toward functional FGMs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based Energy Harvesting Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been of considerable interest for energy harvesting, due to their high gravimetric surface area and high thermal and electrical conductivities. In this review, the working principles, applications, and challenges of CNT&#8208;based nanogenerators based on electrochemical, hydroelectric, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and thermoelectric effects are introduced.








Abstract
There has been enormous interest in technologies that generate electricity from ambient energy such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, due to their potential for providing sustainable solutions to the energy crisis. One driving force behind the search for new energy&#8208;harvesting technologies is the desire to power sensor networks and portable devices without batteries, such as self&#8208;powered wearable electronics, human health monitoring systems, and implantable wireless sensors. Various energy harvesting technologies have been demonstrated in recent years. Among them, electrochemical, hydroelectric, triboelectric, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric nanogenerators have been extensively studied because of their special physical properties, ease of application, and sometimes high obtainable efficiency. Multifunctional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest in energy harvesting because of their exceptionally high gravimetric power outputs and recently obtained high energy conversion efficiencies. Further development of this field, however, still requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of harvesting mechanisms and boosting of the electrical outputs for wider applications. Here, various CNT&#8208;based energy harvesting technologies are comprehensively reviewed, focusing on working principles, typical examples, and future improvements. The last section discusses the existing challenges and future directions of CNT&#8208;based energy harvesters.

         <title>Partial Chemicalization of Nanoscale Metals: An Intra&#8208;Material Transformative Approach for the Synthesis of Functional Colloidal Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Nanoheterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seed nanocrystals can be successfully exploited to generate colloidal metal&#8211;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with programmable configurational diversity, not otherwise accessible by standard seeded&#8208;growth routes. Relevant synthetic strategies based on transformative paradigms are illustrated and rationalized on the basis of available mechanistic knowledge. Some key properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures demonstrate their relevance across several technological fields.








Abstract
Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution&#8208;processable hybrid nanomaterials capable of expressing richly tunable and even entirely novel physical&#8208;chemical properties and functionalities. To meet the challenges posed by the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures and to overcome some intrinsic limitations of available protocols, innovative transformative routes, based on the paradigm of partial chemicalization, have recently been devised within the framework of the standard seeded&#8208;growth scheme. These techniques involve regiospecific replacement reactions on preformed nanocrystal substrates, thus holding great synthetic potential for programmable configurational diversification. This review article illustrates achievements so far made in the elaboration of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with tailored arrangements of their component modules by means of conversion pathways that leverage on spatially controlled partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seeds. The advantages and limitations of these approaches are discussed within the context of the most plausible mechanisms underlying the evolution of the nanoheterostructures in liquid media. Representative physical&#8208;chemical properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures are emphasized.

     alt="Partial Chemicalization of Nanoscale Metals: An Intra-Material Transformative Approach for the Synthesis of Functional Colloidal Metal-Semiconductor Nanoheterostructures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partial chemicalization of mono- and bi-metallic seed nanocrystals can be successfully exploited to generate colloidal metal&#8211;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with programmable configurational diversity, not otherwise accessible by standard seeded-growth routes. Relevant synthetic strategies based on transformative paradigms are illustrated and rationalized on the basis of available mechanistic knowledge. Some key properties and applications of chemicalization-derived metal-semiconductor nanoheterostructures demonstrate their relevance across several technological fields.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution-processable hybrid nanomaterials capable of expressing richly tunable and even entirely novel physical-chemical properties and functionalities. To meet the challenges posed by the wet-chemical synthesis of metal-semiconductor nanoheterostructures and to overcome some intrinsic limitations of available protocols, innovative transformative routes, based on the paradigm of partial chemicalization, have recently been devised within the framework of the standard seeded-growth scheme. These techniques involve regiospecific replacement reactions on preformed nanocrystal substrates, thus holding great synthetic potential for programmable configurational diversification. This review article illustrates achievements so far made in the elaboration of metal-semiconductor nanoheterostructures with tailored arrangements of their component modules by means of conversion pathways that leverage on spatially controlled partial chemicalization of mono- and bi-metallic seeds. The advantages and limitations of these approaches are discussed within the context of the most plausible mechanisms underlying the evolution of the nanoheterostructures in liquid media. Representative physical-chemical properties and applications of chemicalization-derived metal-semiconductor nanoheterostructures are emphasized. Finally, prospects for developments in the field are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revisiting the Role of Discharge Products in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is limited by the difficulty of discharge product (DP) decomposition because of their thermodynamical stability. This review revisits the impacts of discharge products on L&#8211;CO2 batteries, assesses advanced techniques for mechanism investigation of DP formation and decomposition, and reviews the main control methods for DP management to boost the Li&#8211;CO2 battery performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries are promising devices for CO2 recycling and energy storage. However, thermodynamically stable and electrically insulating discharge products (DPs) (e.g., Li2CO3) deposited at cathodes require rigorous conditions for completed decomposition, resulting in large recharge polarization and poor battery reversibility. Although progress has been achieved in cathode design and electrolyte optimization, the significance of DPs is generally underestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the role of DPs in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries to boost overall battery performance. Here, a critical and systematic review of DPs in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is reported for the first time. Fundamentals of reactions for formation and decomposition of DPs are appraised; impacts on battery performance including overpotential, capacity, and stability are demonstrated; and the necessity of discharge product management is highlighted. Practical in situ/operando technologies are assessed to characterize reaction intermediates and the corresponding DPs for mechanism investigation. Additionally, achievable control measures to boost the decomposition of DPs are evidenced to provide battery design principles and improve the battery performance. Findings from this work will deepen the understanding of electrochemistry of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and promote practical applications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Responsive Materials: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of circularly polarized light&#8208;responsive materials are systematically summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) with the end of optical vector traveling along circumferential trajectory shows left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness, which transmits chiral information to materials via complicated CPL&#8211;matter interactions. Materials with circular dichroism respond to CPL illumination selectively with differential outputs that can be used to design novel photodetectors. Racemic or achiral compounds under CPL go through photodestruction, photoresolution, and asymmetric synthesis pathways to generate enantiomeric bias and optical activity. By this strategy, helical polymers and chiral inorganic plasmonic nanostructures are synthesized directly, and their intramolecular folding and subsequent self&#8208;assembly are photomodulable as well. In the aggregated state of self&#8208;assembly and liquid crystal phase, helical sense of the dynamic molecular packing is sensitive to enantiomeric bias brought by CPL, enabling the chiral amplification to supramolecular scale. In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of CPL&#8208;responsive materials are aimed to be systematically summarized and discussed. Asymmetric synthesis, resolution, and property&#8208;modulation of small organic compounds, polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, supramolecular assemblies and liquid crystals are highlighted based on the important developments during the last decades. Besides, applications of light&#8211;matter interactions including CPL detection and biomedical applications are also referred.
