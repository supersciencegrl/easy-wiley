         <title>Ten Years of Progress in the Synthesis and Development of MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are among the largest 2D material families. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity, render them quite useful in a large number of applications including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. A brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, the number of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has steadily increased. Currently more than 40 MXene compositions exist. The ultimate number is far greater and in time they may develop into the largest family of 2D materials known. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity reaching &#8776;20&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1, render them quite useful in a large number of applications, including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. The number of MXene papers and patents published has been growing quickly. The first MXene generation is synthesized using selective etching of metal layers from the MAX phases, layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides using hydrofluoric acid. Since then, multiple synthesis approaches have been developed, including selective etching in a mixture of fluoride salts and various acids, non&#8208;aqueous etchants, halogens, and molten salts, allowing for the synthesis of new MXenes with better control over their surface chemistries. Herein, a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided. The fact that their production is readily scalable in aqueous environments, with high yields bodes well for their commercialization.

         <title>Micropatterns Fabricated by Photodimerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns on film surfaces is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and mass transport of maleimide. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in microfluidic channels, composite gratings, devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Pattern technology plays an important role in the generation of microstructures with different functionalities and morphologies. In this report, a straightforward and versatile strategy is presented for spatially regulating the growth of a microstructure on a surface by the photodimerization of maleimide (MI). Upon exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, photodimerization of MI in a film comprising furan&#8208;grafted polymer and bismaleimide (BMI) produces a chemical gradient, which can drive the diffusion of BMI from the unexposed to the exposed region and from the bottom to the surface, resulting in the growth of micropatterns. Sequential crosslinking induced by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between MI and furan maintains the stability of pattern shape. Theoretical modeling with reaction&#8208;diffusion equations reveal that as photodimerization moves the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the formation of a chemical potential gradient requires the redistribution of matter, resulting in the formation of topographies. Directional molecular motion induced by UV light can generate complex morphology, and produce materials with unique optical functions, such as charming&#8208;ordered gratings. This straightforward method of fabricating micropatterns by photodimerization&#8208;induced diffusion is successfully applied to patterned curved surfaces, microfluidic channels and encapsulation of integrated light emitting diode chips.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular manipulation of redox&#8208;active groups in covalent organic framework (COF) units shows that quinone&#8208;functionalized COFs significantly enhance the specific capacity, elevate the discharge potential, and improve the competitiveness of Zn2+ against H+ intercalation through a stronger coordination bond between cations and C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N groups.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are potentially promising electrode materials for electrochemical charge storage applications thanks to their pre&#8208;designable reticular chemistry with atomic precision, allowing precise control of pore size, redox&#8208;active functional moieties, and stable covalent frameworks. However, studies on the mechanistic and practical aspects of their zinc&#8208;ion storage behavior are still limited. In this study, a strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of COF cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) by introducing the quinone group into 1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs is reported. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the introduction of the quinone groups in the COF significantly pushes up the Zn2+ storage capability against H+ and elevates the average (dis&#8208;)charge potential in aqueous ZIBs. Computational and experimental analysis further reveals the favorable redox&#8208;active sites that host Zn2+/H+ in COF electrodes and the root cause for the enhanced electrochemical performance. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering of the COF structure is an effective approach to achieve practical charge storage performance.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Eu&#8208;MOF on Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;MOF is introduced to the field of perovskite solar cells. Both Eu ions and organic ligands reduce the defect concentration. More over, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF improves the light utilization. Meanwhile, it also turns tensile strain to compressive strain. Finally, the device performance, in efficiency and stability, is increased dramatically due to the synergetic effects.








Abstract
Enhancing device lifetime is one of the essential challenges in perovskite solar cells. The ultrathin Eu&#8208;MOF layer is introduced at the interface between the electron&#8208;transport layer and the perovskite absorber to improve the device stability. Both Eu ions and organic ligands in the MOF can reduce the defect concentration and improve carrier transport. Moreover, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF in perovskite films can improve light utilization and reduce the decomposition under ultraviolet light. Meanwhile, Eu&#8208;MOF also turns tensile strain to compressive strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16%. In addition, the devices retain 96% of their original PCE after 2000 h under the relative humidity of 30% and 91% of their original PCE after 1200 h after continuous 85&#160;&#176;C aging condition in N2.

         <title>Bitter Flavored, Soft Composites for Wearables Designed to Reduce Risks of Choking in Infants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bitter&#8208;flavored formulations in soft encapsulating layers and hydrogel adhesives for skin&#8208;interfaced wireless devices reduce risks of choking with infants. A bitter dopant, denatonium benzoate, integrated into soft silicone elastomers and hydrogels triggers a reflexive response when dissolved in saliva. Demonstrations in a variety of devices for physiological monitoring highlight the compatibility of these unusual composite materials in clinical&#8208;grade wearables.








Abstract
Wireless, skin&#8208;integrated devices for continuous, clinical&#8208;quality monitoring of vital signs have the potential to greatly improve the care of patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive&#8208;care units. These same technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent life&#8208;threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety feature. The materials systems described involve a non&#8208;toxic bitterant (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into various wireless skin&#8208;integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children monitored with wearable devices.

&lt;p&gt;Bitter-flavored formulations in soft encapsulating layers and hydrogel adhesives for skin-interfaced wireless devices reduce risks of choking with infants. A bitter dopant, denatonium benzoate, integrated into soft silicone elastomers and hydrogels triggers a reflexive response when dissolved in saliva. Demonstrations in a variety of devices for physiological monitoring highlight the compatibility of these unusual composite materials in clinical-grade wearables.

         <title>A Highly Compressible and Stretchable Carbon Spring for Smart Vibration and Magnetism Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous spring&#8208;like all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% is obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is designed. The excellent mechanical performance combined with the intrinsic advantages of carbon makes it a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors that can work at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Porous carbon materials demonstrate extensive applications for their attractive characteristics. Mechanical flexibility is an essential property guaranteeing their durability. After decades of research efforts, compressive brittleness of porous carbon materials is well resolved. However, reversible stretchability remains challenging to achieve due to the intrinsically weak connections and fragile joints of the porous carbon networks. Herein, it is presented that a porous all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% can be obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is introduced. Impressively, the porous all&#8208;carbon material can maintain reliable structural robustness and durability under loading condition of cyclic compressing&#8211;stretching process, similar to a real metallic spring. The unique performance renders it as a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors, even capable of operating at extreme temperatures. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights for creating highly stretchable and compressible porous materials from other neat inorganic components for diverse applications in future.

         <title>Hollow InVO4 Nanocuboid Assemblies toward Promoting Photocatalytic N2 Conversion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The InVO4 superstructure with a cube&#8208;shaped skeleton and hollow interior is synthesized. The closely ordered assembly of nanocuboids improves the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs through promoted charge transfer among neighboring building blocks. This promising charge mobility feature contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of InVO4 superstrucure toward N2 fixation into NH3.








Abstract
The unique InVO4 mesocrystal superstructure, particularly with cubical skeleton and hollow interior, which consists of numerous nanocube building blocks, closely stacking by stacking, aligning by aligning, and sharing the same crystallographic orientations, is successfully fabricated. The synergy of a reaction&#8208;limited aggregation and an Ostwald ripening process is reasonably proposed for the growth of this unique superstructure. Both single&#8208;particle surface photovoltage and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the long&#8208;range ordered mesocrystal superstructures can significantly retard the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs through the creation of a new pathway for anisotropic electron flow along the inter&#8208;nanocubes. This promising charge mobility feature of the superstructure greatly contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of the InVO4 mesocrystal toward fixation of N2 into NH3 with the quantum yield of 0.50% at wavelength of 385&#160;nm.

         <title>Ultrafast Bubble Bursting by Superamphiphobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superamphiphobic surfaces for ultrafast bubble bursting are introduced. Liquid flame spray is fast and scalable, and allows tuning of the nano&#8208; and micrometer&#8208;scale architecture of hierarchical surface structures. Bubbles burst rapidly upon contact and the gas is absorbed into the surface structures. The recorded rates are enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to previously reported results.








Abstract
Controlling bubble motion or passively bursting bubbles using solid interfaces is advantageous in numerous industrial applications including flotation, catalysis, electrochemical processes, and microfluidics. Current research has explored the formation, dissolution, pinning, and rupturing of bubbles on different surfaces. However, the ability to tune and control the rate of bubble bursting is not yet achieved. Scaling down surface&#8208;induced bubble bursting to just a few milliseconds is important for any application. In this work, the hierarchical structure of superamphiphobic surfaces is tuned in order to rapidly rupture contacting bubbles. Surfaces prepared using liquid flame spray show ultrafast bubble bursting (down to 2&#160;ms) and superior durability. The coatings demonstrate excellent mechanical and chemical stability even in the presence of surface&#8208;active species. Air from the ruptured bubble is absorbed into the aerophilic Cassie&#8208;state. Long&#8208;term applicability is demonstrated by preventing the accumulation of air in the plastron via a connection of the plastron to the environment. The times recorded for bubble rupture and complete reorganization of air are reduced by approximately a factor of 3 compared to previously reported values. The concept is utilized to passively control surfactant&#8208;rich foam in froth flotation. Material collection efficiency increased by more than 60&#160;times compared to controls.

         <title>Synaptic Plasticity Powering Long&#8208;Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) layer is integrated into a novel organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) device. The UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoinduced synaptic effect is used to power a persistent bright afterglow emission in an organic light&#8208;emitting material. The unique OLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting luminescence in optoelectronic devices is highly sought after for applications in optical data storage and display technology. While in light&#8208;emitting diodes this is achieved by exploiting long&#8208;afterglow organic materials as active components, such a strategy has never been pursued in light&#8208;emitting transistors, which are still rather unexplored and whose technological potential is yet to be demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of long&#8208;afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (LAOLETs) is reported whose operation relies on an unprecedented strategy based on a photoinduced synaptic effect in an inorganic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) semiconducting channel layer, to power a persistent electroluminescence in organic light&#8208;emitting materials. Oxygen vacancies in the IGZO layer, produced by irradiation at &#955;&#160;= 312&#160;nm, free electrons in excess yielding to a channel conductance increase. Due to the slow recombination kinetics of photogenerated electrons to oxygen vacancies in the channel layer, the organic material can be fueled by postsynaptic current and displays a long&#8208;lived light&#8208;emission (hundreds of seconds) after ceasing UV irradiation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the LAOLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.

         <title>A Zwitterionic Polyurethane Nanoporous Device with Low Foreign&#8208;Body Response for Islet Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic nanofibrous islet encapsulation device made of sulfobetaine&#8208;modified polyurethane is reported. The device is mechanically robust, effective in preventing cell entrance or escape, hydrophilic with facile mass transfer, and biocompatible with low levels of fibrotic deposition in mice, dogs, and pigs. These attributes make it an attractive candidate for safe delivery of insulin&#8208;producing cells to treat type 1 diabetes.








Abstract
Encapsulation of insulin&#8208;producing cells is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, engineering an encapsulation device that is both safe (i.e., no cell escape and no breakage) and functional (i.e., low foreign&#8208;body response (FBR) and high mass transfer) remains a challenge. Here, a family of zwitterionic polyurethanes (ZPU) with sulfobetaine groups in the polymer backbone is developed, which are fabricated into encapsulation devices with tunable nanoporous structures via electrospinning. The ZPU encapsulation device is hydrophilic and fouling&#8208;resistant, exhibits robust mechanical properties, and prevents cell escape while still allowing efficient mass transfer. The ZPU device also induces a much lower FBR or cellular overgrowth upon intraperitoneal implantation in C57BL/6 mice for up to 6 months compared to devices made of similar polyurethane without the zwitterionic modification. The therapeutic potential of the ZPU device is shown for islet encapsulation and diabetes correction in mice for &#8776;3 months is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the ZPU device in pigs and dogs are further demonstrated. Collectively, these attributes make ZPU devices attractive candidates for cell encapsulation therapies.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Nonfouling Zwitterionic Triple&#8208;Network Hydrogel in Saline Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties in saline environments, important for biomedical and engineering applications, by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network hydrogel. Strong chain entanglement and electrostatic interactions provide effective energy dissipation to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Zwitterionic hydrogels have received great attention due to their excellent nonfouling and biocompatible properties, but they suffer from weak mechanical strength in the saline environments important for biomedical and engineering applications due to the &#8220;anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte&#8221; effect. Conventional strategies to introduce hydrophobic or non&#8208;zwitterionic components to increase mechanical strength compromise their nonfouling properties. Here, a highly effective strategy is reported to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network (ZTN) hydrogel. The strong electrostatic interaction and network entanglement within the triple&#8208;network structure can effectively dissipate energy to toughen the hydrogel and achieve high strength, toughness, and stiffness in saline environments (compressive fracture stress 18.2 &#177; 1.4&#160;MPa,&#160;toughness 1.62 &#177; 0.03&#160;MJ m&#8211;3,&#160;and modulus 0.66 &#177; 0.03&#160;MPa&#160;in seawater environments). Moreover, the ZTN hydrogel is shown to strongly resist the attachment of proteins, bacteria, and cells. The results provide a fundamental understanding to guide the design of tough nonfouling zwitterionic hydrogels for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Tumor&#8208;Penetrating and Oligomeric Nanozyme Based on Intrinsically Self&#8208;Assembling Protein Nanocages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains challenging to precisely control and reproducibly formulate nanomedicines. A nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy is established for tailoring oligomeric nanostructures and a series of artificial metalloenzymes in a precisely controlled manner, which offers an option for tailored anticancer nanomedicines that have a high degree of control over both geometry and valency.








Abstract
Biomimetic design of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics has emerged as a promising method for the generation of novel therapeutics. However, synthesis of nanomaterials while maintaining a high degree of control over both geometry and valency poses a prominent challenge. Herein, the authors introduce a nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy for accurate and quantitative tailoring of high&#8208;ordered nanostructures that uses a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; hierarchical incorporation of protein building blocks. The assembled nano&#8208;oligomers possessed tunable protein motifs and multivalent binding domains, which facilitated prolonged blood circulation time, accumulation within tumor cells through direct targeting of cell receptors, and deep tumor tissue penetration via a transcytosis mechanism. Using these protein/protein nano&#8208;oligomers as scaffolds, the authors created a new series of artificial nano&#8208;scaled metalloenzymes (nanozymes) by the in situ incorporation of metal nanoclusters within the cavity of the protein nanocages. Nanozymes were&#160;capable of mimicking peroxidase&#8208;like activity and generated cytotoxic free radicals. Compared to nanozyme alone, the systemic delivery of oligomeric nanozymes demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic and anti&#8208;tumor benefits. This study shows a new insight into nanotechnology by taking advantage of synthetic biotechnology.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Hydrophobicity Transformation, Thermoresponsive Morphomechanics, and Crack Multifurcation Revealed by AIEgens in Mechanically Strong Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity transformation is achieved in a facile, high&#8208;contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as fluorescent indicators. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical study, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed.








Abstract
Biomimetic exploration of stimuli&#8208;responsive and crack&#8208;resistant hydrogels is of great academic and practical significance, although the rational design of tough hydrogels is limited by insufficient mechanism study due to the lack of imaging techniques to &#8220;see&#8221; hydrogels at mesoscale level. A series of composite hydrogels with compartmentalized thermal response is designed by incorporating aggregation&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes in a poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network grafted with poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) side&#8208;chains. The fluorescence technique is explored as a powerful tool to directly visualize their hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation and the composition&#8208;dependent microphase separation. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of multiple noncovalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack multifurcation is related to the tearing&#8208;like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in Crystalline Solids: How Does It Collapse?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding in solids is shown to differ significantly from covalent bonding, as demonstrated by pronounced property changes for optical, vibrational, electronic, and structural properties upon the transition from covalent to metavalent bonding. This insight and the resulting map showing trends in chemical bonding and material properties can be used to design and tailor materials.








Abstract
The chemical bond is one of the most powerful, yet much debated concepts in chemistry, explaining property trends in solids. Recently, a novel type of chemical bonding was&#160;identified in several higher chalcogenides, characterized by a unique property portfolio, unconventional bond breaking, and sharing of about one electron between adjacent atoms. This metavalent bond is a fundamental type of bonding in solids, besides covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, raising the pertinent question as to whether there is a well&#8208;defined transition between metavalent and covalent bonds. Here, three different pseudo&#8208;binary lines, namely, GeTe1&#8722;xSex, Sb2Te3(1&#8722;x)Se3x, and Bi2&#8722;2xSb2xSe3, are studied, and a sudden change in several properties, including optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, Born effective charge Z*, electrical conductivity, as well as bond breaking behavior for a critical Se or Sb concentration, is evidenced. These findings provide a blueprint to experimentally explore the influence of metavalent bonding on attractive properties of phase&#8208;change materials and thermoelectrics. Particularly important is its impact on optical properties, which can be tailored by the amount of electrons shared between adjacent atoms. This correlation can be used to design optoelectronic materials and to explore systematic changes in chemical bonding with stoichiometry and atomic arrangement.

&lt;p&gt;Metavalent bonding in solids is shown to differ significantly from covalent bonding, as demonstrated by pronounced property changes for optical, vibrational, electronic, and structural properties upon the transition from covalent to metavalent bonding. This insight and the resulting map showing trends in chemical bonding and material properties can be used to design and tailor materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical bond is one of the most powerful, yet much debated concepts in chemistry, explaining property trends in solids. Recently, a novel type of chemical bonding was&#160;identified in several higher chalcogenides, characterized by a unique property portfolio, unconventional bond breaking, and sharing of about one electron between adjacent atoms. This metavalent bond is a fundamental type of bonding in solids, besides covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, raising the pertinent question as to whether there is a well-defined transition between metavalent and covalent bonds. Here, three different pseudo-binary lines, namely, GeTe&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Se&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3(1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are studied, and a sudden change in several properties, including optical absorption &#949;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#969;), optical dielectric constant &#949;&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;, Born effective charge &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;*, electrical conductivity, as well as bond breaking behavior for a critical Se or Sb concentration, is evidenced. These findings provide a blueprint to experimentally explore the influence of metavalent bonding on attractive properties of phase-change materials and thermoelectrics. Particularly important is its impact on optical properties, which can be tailored by the amount of electrons shared between adjacent atoms. This correlation can be used to design optoelectronic materials and to explore systematic changes in chemical bonding with stoichiometry and atomic arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photonic Bandgap in Achiral Liquid Crystals&#8212;A Twist on a Twist</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photonic bandgap phenomenon is observed in a liquid crystalline phase built of achiral molecules, in which a tendency to twist is caused by steric interactions between strongly bent molecules. A selective reflection of visible light appears due to unwinding of the helical structure at the transition between two smectic phases having a single&#8208; and double&#8208;helical structure.








Abstract
Achiral mesogenic molecules are shown to be able to spontaneously assemble into liquid crystalline smectic phases having either simple or double&#8208;helical structures. At the transition between these phases, the double&#8208;helical structure unwinds. As a consequence, in some temperature range, the pitch of the helix becomes comparable to the wavelength of visible light and the selective reflection of light in the visible range is observed. The photonic bandgap phenomenon is reported for achiral liquid crystals.

         <title>A Sustainable and Flexible Microbrush&#8208;Faced Triboelectric Generator for Portable/Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbrush&#8208;faced triboelectric nanogenerator featuring high robustness, outstanding sustainability, and excellent durability displays remarkable capability for mechanical energy harvesting in separate working modes. Human&#8208;being&#8208;interactive triboelectrification with this device reveals outstanding power generation and durability, suggesting that it can serve as a power source for various types of handheld electronics.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are put forward as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy&#8208;scavenging technology for self&#8208;powered electronics, but their severe wear and degradation driven by inevitable friction can pose significant durability and sustainability concerns. Here, an array of microfibers is reported that functions as a robust and sustainable TENG in both in&#8208;plane sliding and vertical contact&#8208;separation modes, with excellent electrical potential as high as 20&#160;V and a high cyclability of 3000. The design flexibility of this microbrush TENG (MB&#8208;TENG) on the counter materials facilitates the further improvement of electrical outputs, benefiting numerous applications of human&#8208;interactive triboelectrification. Significantly, these MB&#8208;TENGs offer sufficient output power for successfully driving a smartwatch as well as an electromyography module. This technology uses a simple and cost&#8208;effective manner to provide a robust and reliable monolithic TENG module, which is expected to serve as a promising energy&#8208;harvesting source for self&#8208;powered electronics in the near future.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Cooperative Transition in Molecular Electronic Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major challenge in a supramolecular electronic crystal is switchable control of its hidden phase. The cooperative tuning of K&#8208;TCNQ through a pulsed electromagnetic field into an emergent electronic disorder state, enabling access to a long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) hidden conducting phase, is found. A switchable magneto&#8208;electronic bistability is realized in a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K.








Abstract
The competing and non&#8208;equilibrium phase transitions, involving dynamic tunability of cooperative electronic and magnetic states in strongly correlated materials, show great promise in quantum sensing and information technology. To date, the stabilization of transient states is still in the preliminary stage, particularly with respect to molecular electronic solids. Here, a dynamic and cooperative phase in potassium&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (K&#8208;TCNQ) with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation is demonstrated. Simultaneous dynamic and coherent lattice perturbation with 8 ns&#160;pulsed laser (532&#160;nm, 15 MW&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10 Hz)&#160;in such a molecular electronic crystal initiates a stable long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) conducting paramagnetic state (&#8776;42 &#937;cm), showing the charge&#8211;spin bistability over a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K. Comprehensive noise spectroscopy, in situ high&#8208;pressure measurements, electron spin resonance (ESR), theoretical model, and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies provide further evidence that such a transition is cooperative, requiring a dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling to activate and subsequently stabilize nonequilibrium phase. The cooperativity triggered by ultrahigh&#8208;strain&#8208;rate (above 106 s&#8722;1) pulsed excitation offers a collective control toward the generation and stabilization of strongly correlated electronic and magnetic orders in molecular electronic solids and offers unique electro&#8208;magnetic phases with technological promises.

         <title>Daratumumab Immunopolymersome&#8208;Enabled Safe and CD38&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Depletion of Multiple Myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;nanomedicines are emerging targeted cancer therapeutics that might reshape the clinical treatment scheme. Novel fabrication of small and smart daratumumab immunopolymersomes is presented carrying vincristine sulfate that induce extraordinary potency and selectivity while mitigating systemic toxicity toward orthotopic multiple myeloma in vivo.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a second ranking hematological malignancy. Despite the fast advancement of new treatments such as bortezormib and daratumumab, MM patients remain incurable and tend to eventually become relapsed and drug&#8208;resistant. Development of novel therapies capable of depleting MM cells is strongly needed. Here, daratumumab immunopolymersomes carrying vincristine sulfate (Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR) are reported for safe and high&#8208;efficacy CD38&#8208;targeted chemotherapy and depletion of orthotopic MM in vivo. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR made by postmodification via strain&#8208;promoted click reaction holds tailored antibody density (2.2, 4.4 to 8.7 Dar per IPs), superb stability, small size (43&#8211;49&#160;nm), efficacious VCR loading, and glutathione&#8208;responsive VCR release. Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR induces exceptional anti&#8208;MM activity with an IC50 of 76 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m to CD38&#8208;positive LP&#8208;1&#160;MM cells, 12&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold enhancement over nontargeted Ps&#8208;VCR and free VCR controls, respectively. Intriguingly, mice bearing orthotopic LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc MM following four cycles of i.v. administration of Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR at 0.25&#160;mg VCR equiv. kg&#8722;1 reveal complete depletion of LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc cells, superior survival rate to all controls, and no body weight loss. The bone and histological analyses indicate bare bone and organ damage. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR appears as a safe and targeted treatment for CD38&#8208;overexpressed hematological malignancies.

Intriguingly, mice bearing orthotopic LP-1-Luc MM following four cycles of i.v. administration of Dar&lt;sub&gt;4.4&lt;/sub&gt;-IPs-VCR at 0.25&#160;mg VCR equiv. kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; reveal complete depletion of LP-1-Luc cells, superior survival rate to all controls, and no body weight loss. The bone and histological analyses indicate bare bone and organ damage.

         <title>Improving the Stability of Non&#8208;Noble&#8208;Metal M&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells through M&#8211;N Bond Length and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy is developed to improve the stability of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in half&#8208;cell and H2&#8211;O2/air fuel cells by accurately regulating the M&#63743;N bond length/coordination. Interestingly, the Fe&#63743;N bond length/coordination of the catalysts are strongly dependent on the binding constant of Fe3+ and polymer in the precursors, which can be linked with their performance degradation in fuel cells.








Abstract
An effective and universal strategy is developed to enhance the stability of the non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal M&#8211;Nx/C catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) by improving the bonding strength between metal ions and chelating polymers, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) homopolymer and poly(acrylic acid&#8211;maleic acid) (P(AA&#8208;MA)) copolymer with different AA/MA ratios. M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that the optimal P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst with a higher Fe3+&#8211;polymer binding constant possesses longer Fe&#63743;N bonds and exclusive Fe&#8211;N4/C moiety compared to PAA&#8211;Fe&#8211;N, which consists of &#8776;15% low&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8211;N2/N3 structures. The optimized P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both half&#8208;cell and PEMFC cathodes, with the retention rate of current density approaching 100% for the first 37 h at 0.55&#160;V in an H2&#8211;air fuel cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Fe&#8211;N4/C site could optimize the difference between the adsorption energy of the Fe atoms on the support (Ead) and the bulk cohesive energy (Ecoh) relative to Fe&#8211;N2/N3 moieties, thereby strongly stabilizing Fe centers against demetalation.

         <title>Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al Nanowire Heterostructure: From Single&#8208;Hole Quantum Dot to Josephson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly tunable superconducting&#8211;semiconducting hybrid junction based on intrinsic germanium (i&#8208;Ge) nanowires is revealed. Low&#8208;temperature transport measurements of ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt Al&#8211;Ge interfaces demonstrate that such i&#8208;Ge quantum dot devices can be tuned to access three distinct regimes: single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dots, an intermediate sub&#8208;gap states regime, and a superconducting regime.








Abstract
Superconductor&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;superconductor heterostructures are attractive for both fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid systems as well as for future high&#8208;performance low power dissipating nanoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces are used to probe the low&#8208;temperature transport in intrinsic Ge (i&#8208;Ge) quantum dots. In particular, demonstrating the ability to tune the Ge quantum dot device from completely insulating, through a single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dot regime, to a supercurrent regime, resembling a Josephson field effect transistor with a maximum critical current of 10 nA at a temperature of 390 mK. The realization of a Josephson field&#8208;effect transistor with high junction transparency provides a mechanism to study sub&#8208;gap transport mediated by Andreev states. The presented results reveal a promising intrinsic Ge&#8208;based architecture for hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor devices for the study of Majorana zero modes and key components of quantum computing such as gatemons or gate tunable superconducting quantum interference devices.

         <title>Anisotropic Iridescence and Polarization Patterns in a Direct Ink Written Chiral Photonic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural examples of patterned iridescence, an ink based on a chiral nematic liquid crystal that can be processed with a direct ink writer 3D printer is shown. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis that exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity.








Abstract
The iridescence of structural color and its polarization characteristics originate from the nanoscale organization of materials. A major challenge in materials science is generating the bright, lustrous hues seen in nature through nanoscale engineering, while simultaneously controlling interaction of the material with different light polarizations. In this work, a suitable chiral nematic liquid crystal elastomer ink is synthesized for direct ink writing, which self&#8208;assembles into a chiral photonic structure. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis, which exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity. After crosslinking, a freely programmable, chiroptical photonic polymer material is obtained. The strongly perspective&#8208;dependent appearance of the material can function as specialized anticounterfeit markers, as optical elements in decorative iridescent coatings, or, as demonstrated here, in optically based signaling features.

         <title>Dynamic Symmetry Breaking in Chiral Magnetic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in&#8208;plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in&#8208;plane field axis. Accounting for steady&#8208;state DW dynamics, the reported model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries. These results expand the utility of DW motion in probing chiral magnetism.








Abstract
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic systems stabilizes spin textures with preferred chirality, applicable to next&#8208;generation memory and computing architectures. In perpendicularly magnetized heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet films, the interfacial DMI originating from structural inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling favors chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs) whose energetics and mobility remain at issue. Here, a new effect is characterized in which domains expand unidirectionally in response to a combination of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane magnetic fields, with the growth direction controlled by the in&#8208;plane field strength. These growth directionalities and symmetries with applied fields cannot be understood from static treatments alone. The authors theoretically demonstrate that perpendicular field torques stabilize steady&#8208;state magnetization profiles highly asymmetric in elastic energy, resulting in a dynamic symmetry breaking consistent with the experimental findings. This phenomenon sheds light on the mechanisms governing the dynamics of N&#233;el&#8208;type DWs and expands the utility of field&#8208;driven DW motion to probe and control chiral DWs.

         <title>Reduced Intrinsic Non&#8208;Radiative Losses Allow Room&#8208;Temperature Triplet Emission from Purely Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a hydrogen atom with an N&#8208;phenyl ring is demonstrated to convert an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature, originating from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations, which can be used for data safety applications.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence from triplet excitons in organic molecules is rare, as fast non&#8208;radiative deactivation typically dominates over radiative transitions. This work demonstrates that the substitution of a hydrogen atom in a derivative of phenanthroimidazole with an N&#8208;phenyl ring can substantially stabilize the excited state. This stabilization converts an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature. Results from systematic photophysical investigations, kinetic modeling, excited&#8208;state dynamic modeling, and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis identify that the long&#8208;lived triplets originate from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations. Further modification of the N&#8208;phenyl ring with halogen atoms affects the afterglow lifetime and quantum yield. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an anticounterfeiting device is demonstrated with a time&#8208;dependent Morse code feature for data encryption based on these emitters. A fundamental design principle is outlined to achieve long&#8208;lived and emissive triplet states by suppressing intrinsic non&#8208;radiative relaxations in the form of molecular vibrations or rotations.

         <title>54 cm2 Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Modules with Efficiency Above 13%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient large&#8208;area flexible solar cells and modules are demonstrated based on a printable, transparent, low&#8208;surface&#8208;roughness, flexible electrode (silver nanowires:zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine). A power conversion efficiency of 13.2% is obtained for a 54 cm2 solar module. The flexible electrode is also demonstrated in high&#8208;performance flexible quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Development of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) is highly desirable for their practical applications. However, the efficiency of the large&#8208;area flexible OSCs severely lags behind small&#8208;area devices. Here, efficient large&#8208;area flexible single cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1% and 12.6% for areas of 6 and 10 cm2, and flexible modules with a PCE of 13.2% (54 cm2) based on poly(ethylene terephthalate)/Ag grid/silver nanowires (AgNWs):zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;Zn) composite electrodes are reported. The solution&#8208;processed flexible transparent electrode of AgNWs:PEI&#8208;Zn shows low surface roughness and good optoelectronic and mechanical properties. PEI&#8208;Zn is conductive and optically transparent. It can adhere to and wrap the AgNWs under electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged surface (AgNWs) and positively charged protonated amine groups (in PEI&#8208;Zn). It wraps the AgNWs networks and fills the void space to achieve a smooth surface. The flexible electrode is validated in both flexible OSCs and flexible quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Small&#8208;area flexible OSCs show a PCE of 16.1%, and flexible QLEDs show an external quantum efficiency of 13.3%. In the end, a flexible module is demonstrated to charge a mobile phone as a flexible power source (shown in Video S1, Supporting Information).

         <title>A Bioresorbable Dynamic Pressure Sensor for Cardiovascular Postoperative Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. A flexible bioresorbable triboelectric pressure sensor is demonstrated based on the triboelectric effect. It can overcome the material limitations caused by the working principle. This device is expected to be applied in postoperative care.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. However, the material limitation is a significant challenge. There are fewer biodegradable materials with pressure&#8208;sensitive properties. Here, a pressure sensor based on the triboelectric effect between bioabsorbable materials is reported. This effect is available in almost all materials. The bioresorbable triboelectric sensor (BTS) can directly convert ambient pressure changes into electrical signals. This device successfully identifies abnormal vascular occlusion events in large animals (dogs). The service life of the BTS reaches 5 days with a high service efficiency (5.95%). The BTS offers excellent sensitivity (11 mV&#160;mmHg&#8722;1), linearity (R2&#160;= 0.993), and good durability (450&#160;000 cycles). The antibacterial bioresorbable materials (poly(lactic acid)&#8211;(chitosan 4%)) for the BTS can achieve 99% sterilization. Triboelectric devices are expected to be applied in postoperative care as bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Halide Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Ion Transport Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realization of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites transistors is challenging due to the presence of mobile ions. A generic strategy is demonstrated that can be applied for regulating ions in mixed ionic&#8211;electronic semiconductors and that enables the demonstration of perovskite transistors working at room&#8208;temperature by fixation of the mobile ions through ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials for applications in photovoltaic solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the presence of mobile ions in the material hinders the development of perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) due to screening of the gate potential in the nearby perovskite channel, and the resulting impediment to achieving gate modulation of an electronic current at room temperature. Here, room&#8208;temperature operation is demonstrated in cesium lead tribromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite&#8208;based FETs using an auxiliary ferroelectric gate of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)], to electrostatically fixate the mobile ions. The large interfacial polarization of the ferroelectric gate attracts the mobile ions away from the main nonferroelectric gate interface, thereby enabling modulation of the electronic current through the channel by the main gate. This strategy allows for realization of the p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 channel and revealing the thermally activated nature of the hole charge transport. The proposed strategy is generic and can be applied for regulating ions in a variety of ionic&#8211;electronic mixed semiconductors.

         <title>A Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19.6% Efficiency Enabled by Light Distribution Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution and employing photovoltaic materials with low energy losses in tandem photovoltaic cell, a power conversion efficiency of 19.64% is achieved.








Abstract
Despite more potential in realizing higher photovoltaic performance, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells still lags behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;junction cells. In this work, highly efficient double&#8208;junction tandem OPV cells are fabricated by optimizing the photoactive layers with low voltage losses and developing an effective method to tune optical field distribution. The tandem OPV cells studied are structured as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/bottom photoactive layer/interconnecting layer (ICL)/top photoactive layer/MoOx/Ag, where the bottom and top photoactive layers are based on blends of PBDB&#8208;TF:ITCC and PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11, respectively, and ICL refers to interconnecting layer structured as MoOx/Ag/ZnO:PFN&#8208;Br. As these results indicate that there is not much room for optimizing the bottom photoactive layer, more effort is put into fine&#8208;tuning the top photoactive layer. By rationally modulating the composition and thickness of PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 blend films, the 300 nm&#8208;thick PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 film with 1:2 D/A ratio is found to be an ideal photoactive layer for the top sub&#8208;cell in terms of photovoltaic characteristics and light distribution control. For the optimized tandem cell, a PCE of 19.64% is realized, which is the highest result in the OPV field and certified as 19.50% by the National Institute of Metrology.

         <title>Magnetization Signature of Topological Surface States in a Non&#8208;Symmorphic Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anomalous surface superconductivity is reported in a non&#8208;symmorphic superconductor, In2Bi, where the nontrivial band structure results in the existence of topologically protected surface states (TSS). The near&#8208;perfect screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above the upper critical field is explained by proximity superconductivity of TSS. Detecting TSS via macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for identification of topological superconductors.








Abstract
Superconductors with nontrivial band structure topology represent a class of materials with unconventional and potentially useful properties. Recent years have seen much success in creating artificial hybrid structures exhibiting the main characteristics of 2D topological superconductors. Yet, bulk materials known to combine inherent superconductivity with nontrivial topology remain scarce, largely because distinguishing their central characteristic&#8212;the topological surface states&#8212;has proved challenging due to a dominant contribution from the superconducting bulk. In this work, a highly anomalous behavior of surface superconductivity in topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor In2Bi, where the surface states result from its nontrivial band structure, itself a consequence of the non&#8208;symmorphic crystal symmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, is reported. In contrast to smoothly decreasing diamagnetic susceptibility above the bulk critical field, Hc2, as seen in conventional superconductors, a near&#8208;perfect, Meissner&#8208;like screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above Hc2 is observed. The enhanced diamagnetism disappears at a new phase transition close to the critical field of surface superconductivity, Hc3. Using theoretical modeling, the anomalous screening is shown to be consistent with modification of surface superconductivity by the topological surface states. The possibility of detecting signatures of the surface states using macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for the discovery and identification of topological superconductors.

         <title>Homogeneous Carbon/Potassium&#8208;Incorporation Strategy for Synthesizing Red Polymeric Carbon Nitride Capable of Near&#8208;Infrared Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;salt&#8208;induced homogeneous incorporation strategy realizes red carbon/potassium&#8208;incorporated polymeric carbon nitride, which exhibits highly efficient H2 evolution from water and in situ hydrogen gas (drug&#8208;free) cancer therapy excited by near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
The efficient utilization of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for photocatalytic hydrogen generation is vitally important to both solar hydrogen energy and hydrogen medicine, but remains a challenge at present, owing to the strict requirement of the semiconductor for high NIR responsiveness, narrow bandgap, and suitable redox potentials. Here, an NIR&#8208;active carbon/potassium&#8208;doped red polymeric carbon nitride (RPCN) is achieved for by using a similar&#8208;structure dopant as the melamine (C3H6N6) precursor with the solid KCl. The homogeneous and high incorporation of carbon and potassium remarkably narrows the bandgap of carbon nitride (1.7&#160;eV) and endows RPCN with a high NIR&#8208;photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water at the rate of 140 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under NIR irradiation (700 nm &#8804; &#955;&#160;&#8804; 780&#160;nm), and the apparent quantum efficiency is high as 0.84% at 700 &#177; 10&#160;nm (and 13% at 500 &#177; 10&#160;nm). A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment on a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model verifies RPCN as being capable of intratumoral NIR&#8208;photocatalytic hydrogen generation and simultaneous glutathione deprivation for safe and high&#8208;efficacy drug&#8208;free cancer therapy. The results shed light on designing efficient photocatalysts to capture the full spectrum of solar energy, and also pioneer a new pathway to develop NIR photocatalysts for hydrogen therapy of major diseases.

         <title>Engineering Endogenous Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage&#8208;Targeted Biomimetic Nano&#8208;RBC to Reprogram Tumor Immunosuppressive Microenvironment for Enhanced Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system is engineered via self&#8208;assembly of a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. The doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;RBC (V(Hb)@DOX) can innately target to decrease the number of immunosuppressive TAMs. Moreover, the O2 released from nano&#8208;RBC relieves tumor hypoxia, which further reprograms the immunosuppressive state to stimulate antitumor responses. The synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy effectively suppresses tumor growth, inhibits metastasis, and prevents autologous tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has shown encouraging results in various cancers, but the response rates are relatively low due to the complex tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor hypoxia correlates significantly with potent immunosuppressive activity. Here, a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate self&#8208;assembled biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system (V(Hb)) is engineered to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) and oxygen for reprogramming TIME. The Hb moiety of V(Hb)@DOX can bind to endogenous plasma haptoglobin (Hp) and specifically target the M2&#8208;type TAMs via the CD163 surface receptor, and effectively kill the cells. In addition, the O2 released by the Hb alleviates tumor hypoxia, which further augments the antitumor immune response by recruiting fewer M2&#8208;type macrophages. TAM&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the TIME, which concurrently downregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression of tumor cells, decrease the levels of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL&#8208;10 and TGF&#8208;&#946;, elevate the immunostimulatory IFN&#8208;&#947;, enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, and boost a strong memory response. The ensuing TAM&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence. Taken together, the engineered endogenous TAM&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano&#8208;RBC system is a highly promising tool to reprogram TIME for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

High&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) are produced via selectively etching a high&#8208;entropy MAX phase, in which five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab, giving rise to stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers. The resultant HE&#8208;MXene has distinct lattice distortions and strains, efficiently guiding the nucleation and uniform growth of lithium.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have great potential for energy storage and conversion due to their diverse compositions, and unexpected physical and chemical features. However, high&#8208;entropy atomic layers with fully exposed active sites are difficult to synthesize since their phases are easily segregated. Here, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) can be produced via the selective etching of novel high&#8208;entropy MAX (also termed Mn+1AXn (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3), where M represents an early transition&#8208;metal element, A is an element mainly from groups 13&#8211;16, and X stands for C and/or N) phase (HE&#8208;MAX) (Ti1/5V1/5Zr1/5Nb1/5Ta1/5)2AlC, in which the five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab due to their solid&#8208;solution feature, giving rise to a stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers owing to the high molar configurational entropy and correspondingly low Gibbs free energy. Additionally, the resultant high&#8208;entropy MXene with distinct lattice distortions leads to high mechanical strain into the atomic layers. Moreover, the mechanical strain can efficiently guide the nucleation and uniform growth of dendrite&#8208;free lithium on HE&#8208;MXene, achieving a long cycling stability of up to 1200 h and good deep stripping&#8211;plating levels of up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Softening of Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photochemical behavior of three chromophores with distinct degradation wavelengths is exploited for the construction of selectively degradable hydrogels. Specifically, hydrogel softening can be achieved in a stepwise fashion according to the chromophores&#8217; activation wavelength, enabling fine control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Photoresponsive hydrogels hold key potential in advanced biomedical applications including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery, as well as intricately engineered functions such as biosensing, soft robotics, and bioelectronics. Herein, the wavelength&#8208;dependent degradation of bio&#8208;orthogonal poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels is reported, using three selective activation levels. Specifically, three chromophores are exploited, that is, ortho&#8208;nitrobenzene, dimethyl aminobenzene, and bimane, each absorbing light at different wavelengths. By examining their photochemical action plots, the wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity of the photocleavable moieties is determined. The wavelength&#8208;selective addressability of individual photoreactive units is subsequently translated into hydrogel design, enabling wavelength&#8208;dependent cleavage of the hydrogel networks on&#8208;demand. Critically, this platform technology allows for the fabrication of various hydrogels, whose mechanical properties can be fine&#8208;tuned using different colors of light to reach a predefined value, according to the chromophore ratios used. The softening is shown to influence the spreading of pre&#8208;osteoblastic cells adhering to the gels as a demonstration of their potential utility. Furthermore, the materials and photodegradation processes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, making this platform attractive for biomaterials engineering.

Chiral Photonic Polymers
In article number 2103309, Albertus P. H. J. Schenning, Michael G. Debije, and co&#8208;workers show that using direct ink writing, unconventional chiral nematic objects can be generated, which show a bright iridescent color from normal incidence, or only from sharp angles of observation depending on the writing speed. The cover is a polarized optical microscopy image showing a detail from the free&#8208;standing Morpho&#8208;inspired print.

MXenes
In article number 2103393, Michael Naguib,  Michel W. Barsoum, and Yury Gogotsi present a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development. The cover shows a colored SEM image of a multilayer Ti3C2 MXene particle with an accordion&#8208;like morphology, which is produced by individual MXene layers stacked together. The variety of colors represents the diversity of MXene structures and compositions. Image Credit: The SEM image was taken by Dr. Tyler Mathis and colored by Dr. Armin VahidMohammadi.

Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy
In article number 2103497, Yubin Huang, Dongfang Zhou, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an engineered endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs)&#8208;targeting biomimetic nano&#8208;red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell (RBC) system to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and oxygen for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. TAMs&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202103497"&gt;2103497&lt;/a&gt;, Yubin Huang, Dongfang Zhou, and co-workers demonstrate an engineered endogenous tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)-targeting biomimetic nano-red-blood-cell (RBC) system to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and oxygen for enhanced cancer chemo-immunotherapy. TAMs-targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The ensuing TAMs-targeted chemo-immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence.

Supramolecular Electronic Crystals
The cooperative tuning of a supramolecular electronic crystal enables access to a long&#8208;lived hidden conducting phase with a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K, through a pulsed electromagnetic field. In article number 2103000, Shenqiang Ren and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a a dynamic and cooperative phase in K&#8208;TCNQ, with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation. A dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling is required to activate and subsequently stabilize the non&#8208;equilibrium phase.

         <title>Advances in the Synthesis of 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress of MXenes synthesis strategies, including etching, intercalation, and delamination, is summarized. The large&#8208;scale preparation methods for MXenes and their derivates, such as flexible membranes and fibers, are discussed. Moreover, the understanding of the oxidation stability of MXenes and stable storage strategies are also addressed.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, also known as MXenes, are versatile materials due to their adjustable structure and rich surface chemistry. The physical and chemical diversity has recognized MXenes as a potential 2D material with a wide spectrum of application domains. Since the discovery of MXenes in 2011, a wide variety of synthetic routes has been proposed with advancement toward large&#8208;scale preparing methods for MXene nanosheets and derivative products. Herein, the critical synthesis aspects and the operating conditions that influence the physical and chemical characteristics of MXenes are discussed in detail. The emerging etching methods including HF etching methods, in situ HF&#8208;forming etching methods, electrochemical etching methods, alkali etching methods, and molten salt etching methods, as well as delamination strategies are discussed. Considering the future developments and practical applications, the large&#8208;scale synthesis routes and the antioxidation strategies of MXenes are also summarized. In summary, a generalized overview of MXenes synthesis protocols with an outlook for the current challenges and promising technologies for large&#8208;scale preparation and stable storage is provided.

         <title>Rational Design of Immunomodulatory Hydrogels for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quality and duration of the healing process can be regulated via modulation of immune responses to tissue injury. Specifically, controlling pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype&#8211;anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype progression is a crucial step to ensure a conversion from the inflammatory to the healing stage. In this regard, immunomodulatory hydrogels with specific chemistry and surface properties can influence immune cell polarization and the chronic wound healing process.








Abstract
With all the advances in tissue engineering for construction of fully functional skin tissue, complete regeneration of chronic wounds is still challenging. Since immune reaction to the tissue damage is critical in regulating both the quality and duration of chronic wound healing cascade, strategies to modulate the immune system are of importance. Generally, in response to an injury, macrophages switch from pro&#8208;inflammatory to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization has become an appealing approach in regenerative medicine. Recently, hydrogels&#8208;based constructs, incorporated with various cellular and molecular signals, have been developed and utilized to adjust immune cell functions in various stages of wound healing. Here, the current state of knowledge on immune cell functions during skin tissue regeneration is first discussed. Recent advanced technologies used to design immunomodulatory hydrogels for controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization are then summarized. Rational design of hydrogels for providing controlled immune stimulation via hydrogel chemistry and surface modification, as well as incorporation of cell and molecules, are also dicussed. In addition, the effects of hydrogels&#8217; properties on immunogenic features and the wound healing process are summarized. Finally, future directions and upcoming research strategies to control immune responses during chronic wound healing are highlighted.

         <title>Emerging Technologies in Multi&#8208;Material Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of the available 3D bioprinting technologies for fabricating multi&#8208;material constructs is presented. The technologies are classified into four major categories, and their advantages and shortcomings are compared. Available multi&#8208;material commercial bioprinters are reviewed, concluding with a perspective of the future path for developing multi&#8208;material technologies.








Abstract
Bioprinting, within the emerging field of biofabrication, aims at the fabrication of functional biomimetic constructs. Different 3D bioprinting techniques have been adapted to bioprint cell&#8208;laden bioinks. However, single&#8208;material bioprinting techniques oftentimes fail to reproduce the complex compositions and diversity of native tissues. Multi&#8208;material bioprinting as an emerging approach enables the fabrication of heterogeneous multi&#8208;cellular constructs that replicate their host microenvironments better than single&#8208;material approaches. Here, bioprinting modalities are reviewed, their being adapted to multi&#8208;material bioprinting is discussed, and their advantages and challenges, encompassing both custom&#8208;designed and commercially available technologies are analyzed. A perspective of how multi&#8208;material bioprinting opens up new opportunities for tissue engineering, tissue model engineering, therapeutics development, and personalized medicine is offered.

         <title>Engineering Nano&#8208; and Microparticles as Oral Delivery Vehicles to Promote Intestinal Lymphatic Drug Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational engineering of effective vehicles for lymphatic delivery of drugs, through targeting enterocytes or M cells, prevents their first&#8208;pass metabolism by the liver, markedly increasing the bioavailability of oral drugs. By achieving increased bioavailability, high drug concentrations are attainable at the lesions of interest with beneficial therapeutic effects, making intestinal lymphatic transport a unique modality of drug delivery.








Abstract
Targeted oral delivery of a drug via the intestinal lymphatic system (ILS) has the advantages of protecting against hepatic first&#8208;pass metabolism of the drug and improving its pharmacokinetic performance. It is also a promising route for the oral delivery of vaccines and therapeutic agents to induce mucosal immune responses and treat lymphatic diseases, respectively. This article describes the anatomical structures and physiological characteristics of the ILS, with an emphasis on enterocytes and microfold (M) cells, which are the main gateways for the transport of particulate delivery vehicles across the intestinal epithelium into the lymphatics. A comprehensive overview of recent advances in the rational engineering of particulate vehicles, along with the challenges and opportunities that they present for improving ILS drug delivery, is provided, and the mechanisms by which such vehicles target and transport through enterocytes or M cells are discussed. The use of naturally sourced materials, such as yeast microcapsules and their derived polymeric &#946;&#8208;glucans, as novel ILS&#8208;targeting delivery vehicles is also reviewed. Such use is the focus of an emerging field of research. Their potential use in the oral delivery of nucleic acids, such as mRNA vaccines, is proposed.

         <title>Application of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion in Organic Optoelectronic Devices: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive summary of advances on developing efficient triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion materials and their application in optoelectronic devices is systematically given in this review. The key challenges and perspectives of TTA upconversion systems for further improvement for optoelectronic devices and other related research directions are provided. This review hopes to provide valuable guidelines for future advancement in organic optoelectronics.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor materials have been widely used in various optoelectronic devices due to their rich optical and/or electrical properties, which are highly related to their excited states. Therefore, how to manage and utilize the excited states in organic semiconductors is essential for the realization of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a unique process of converting two non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons to one singlet exciton with higher energy. Efficient optical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical devices can be realized by harvesting sub&#8208;bandgap photons through TTA&#8208;based upconversion. In electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical devices, triplets generated after the combination of electrons and holes also can be efficiently utilized via TTA, which resulted in a high internal conversion efficiency of 62.5%. Currently, many interesting explorations and significant advances have been demonstrated in these fields. In this review, a comprehensive summary of these intriguing advances on developing efficient TTA upconversion materials and their application in optoelectronic devices is systematically given along with some discussions. Finally, the key challenges and perspectives of TTA upconversion systems for further improvement for optoelectronic devices and other related research directions are provided. This review hopes to provide valuable guidelines for future related research and advancement in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Effects of the Catalyst Dynamic Changes and Influence of the Reaction Environment on the Performance of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focus on understanding the origin of the dynamic changes at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, and uncovering the interplays between these changes and the CO2 reduction performance, the obtained insights can guide the design of catalysts and reactors for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is substantially researched due to its potential for storing intermittent renewable electricity and simultaneously helping mitigating the pressing CO2 emission concerns. The major challenge of electrochemical CO2 reduction lies on having good controls of this reaction due to its complicated reaction networks and its unusual sensitivity to the dynamic changes of the catalyst structure (chemical states, compositions, facets and morphology, etc.), and to the non&#8208;catalyst components at the electrode/electrolyte interface, in another word the reaction environments. To date, a comprehensive analysis on the interplays between the above catalyst&#8208;dynamic&#8208;changes/reaction environments and the CO2 reduction performance is rare, if not none. In this review, the catalyst dynamic changes observed during the catalysis are discussed based on the recent reports of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Then, the above dynamic changes are correlated to their effects on the catalytic performance. The influences of the reaction environments on the performance of CO2 reduction are also discussed. Finally, some perspectives on future investigations are offered with the aim of understanding the origins of the effects from the catalyst dynamic changes and the reaction environments, which will allow one to better control the CO2 reduction toward the desired products.

         <title>Nanophotonic Color Routing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale color routing is reviewed with a focus on the emerging concepts and the technology development trend in particular for the applications in high&#8208;resolution imaging. Nanophotonic methods to manipulate light in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum are presented. The remaining challenges and the potential solutions are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in low&#8208;dimensional materials and nanofabrication technologies have stimulated many breakthroughs in the field of nanophotonics such as metamaterials and plasmonics that provide efficient ways of light manipulation at a subwavelength scale. The representative structure&#8208;induced spectral engineering techniques have demonstrated superior design of freedom compared with natural materials such as pigment/dye. In particular, the emerging spectral routing scheme enables extraordinary light manipulation in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum, which is critically important for various applications and may open up entirely new operating paradigms. In this review, a comparative introduction on the operating mechanisms of spectral routing and spectral filtering schemes is given and recent progress on various color nanorouters based on metasurfaces, plasmonics, dielectric antennas is reviewed with a focus on the potential application in high&#8208;resolution imaging. With a thorough analysis and discussion on the advanced properties and drawbacks of various techniques, this report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development and application of nanophotonic color (spectral) routing techniques.

         <title>Research Progress of Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;Stacked Small Molecules for Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional covalent bond&#8208;connected conjugated molecules, &#960;&#8208;stacked small molecules have special advantages in organic semiconductors. This review mainly focuses on the research development of &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems and introduces the new characteristics brought by the special molecular configuration and its application in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors can be designed and constructed in &#960;&#8208;stacked structures instead of the conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Through&#8208;space interaction (TSI) occurs in &#960;&#8208;stacked optoelectronic materials. Thus, unlike electronic coupling along the conjugated chain, the functional groups can stack closely to facilitate spatial electron communication. Using &#960;&#8208;stacked motifs, chemists and materials scientists can find new ways for constructing materials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), as well as enhanced molecular conductance. Organic optoelectronic devices based on &#960;&#8208;stacked molecules have exhibited very promising performance, with some of them exceeding &#960;&#8208;conjugated analogues. Recently, reports on various organic &#960;&#8208;stacked structures have grown rapidly, prompting this review. Representative molecular scaffolds and newly developed &#960;&#8208;stacked systems could stimulate more attention on through&#8208;space charge transfer the well&#8208;known through&#8208;bond charge transfer. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for utilizing and improving particular materials are discussed. The previous achievements and upcoming prospects may provide new insights into the theory, materials, and devices in the field of organic semiconductors.

         <title>Redox Targeting of Energy Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;targeting process provides great operation flexibility in circumventing the constraints intrinsically posed by the conventional electrochemical systems. It involves a regenerative close&#8208;loop electrochemical&#8211;chemical cycle between an electrolyte&#8208;borne redox mediator and an energy storage/conversion material when implemented in redox&#8208;flow cells, boosting the energy density, and offering an intriguing research platform applied to a variety of chemistries for different applications.








Abstract
The redox&#8208;targeting (RT) process or redox&#8208;mediated process, which provides great operation flexibility in circumventing the constraints intrinsically posed by the conventional electrochemical systems, is intriguing for various energy storage and conversion applications. Implementation of the RT reactions in redox&#8208;flow cells, which involves a close&#8208;loop electrochemical&#8211;chemical cycle between an electrolyte&#8208;borne redox mediator and an energy storage or conversion material, not only boosts the energy density of flow battery system, but also offers a versatile research platform applied to a wide variety of chemistries for different applications. Here, the recent progress of RT&#8208;based energy storage and conversion systems is summarized and great versatility of RT processes for various energy&#8208;related applications is demonstrated, particularly for large&#8208;scale energy storage, spatially decoupled water electrolysis, electrolytic N2 reduction, thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion, spent battery material recycling, and more. The working principle, materials aspects, and factors dictating the operation are highlighted to reveal the critical roles of RT reactions for each application. In addition, the challenges lying ahead for deployment are stated and recommendations for addressing these constraints are provided. It is anticipated that the RT concept of energy materials will provide important implications and eventually offer a credible solution for advanced large&#8208;scale energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Polymerized Hybrid Perovskites with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility, and Lattice Rigidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that hybrid perovskite with unsaturated organoammoniums can undergo solid&#8208;state polymerization without damaging perovskite structure. The polymerized perovskite behaves like a polymer with enhanced stability and flexibility. The lattice rigidity is also enhanced due to the polymerized covalent C&#63743;C bonding. As a result, a stable and efficient polymerized perovskite LEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% is demonstrated.








Abstract
The intrinsic soft lattice nature of organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) makes them very tolerant to defects and ideal candidates for solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices. However, the soft lattice results in low stability towards external stresses such as heating and humidity, high density of phonons and strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling (EPC). Here, it is demonstrated that the OHPs with unsaturated 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium (VBA) as organoammonium cations can be polymerized without damaging the perovskite structure and its tolerance to defects. The polymerized perovskites show enhanced stability and flexibility compared to regular three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites. Furthermore, the polymerized 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium group improves perovskite lattice rigidity substantially, resulting in a reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate because of suppressed electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and enhanced carrier mobility because of suppressed phonon scattering. 2D polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with strong electroluminescence at room temperature, and quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% and enhanced operation stability are demonstrated. The work has opened a new way of enhancing the intrinsic stability and optoelectronic properties of OHPs.

         <title>Controlled Vertically Aligned Structures in Polymer Composites: Natural Inspiration, Structural Processing, and Functional Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progresses in polymer composites with vertically oriented structures are summarized, with an emphasis on natural prototypes, processing methods, and multifunctional applications. Like the fairy tale, Magpie bridge (processing methods) should be highlighted to connect the gap between the Weaver Girl (natural prototypes of vertical structures) and the Cowherd (functional polymeric composites) for close correlations from inspirations to implementations.








Abstract
Vertically aligned structures, which are a series of characteristic conformations with thickness&#8208;direction alignment, interconnection, or assembly of filler in polymeric composite materials that can provide remarkable structural performance and advanced anisotropic functions, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. The past two decades have witnessed extensive development with regard to universal fabrication methods, subtle control of morphological features, improvement of functional properties, and superior applications of vertically aligned structures in various fields. However, a systematic review remains to be attempted. The various configurations of vertical structures inspired from biological samples in nature, such as vertically aligned structures with honeycomb, reed, annual ring, radial, and lamellar configurations are summarized here. Additionally, relevant processing methods, which include the transformation of oriented direction, external&#8208;field inducement, template method, and 3D printing method, are discussed in detail. The diverse applications in mechanical, thermal, electric, dielectric, electromagnetic, water treatment, and energy fields are also highlighted by providing representative examples. Finally, future opportunities and prospects are listed to identify current issues and potential research directions. It is expected that perspectives on the vertically aligned structures presented here will contribute to the research on advanced multifunctional composites.

         <title>High&#8208;Conductive Protonated Layered Oxides from H2O Vapor&#8208;Annealed Brownmillerites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. Here, a thermal hydration synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. By incorporating H2O into the lattice frame, the insulating brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 transforms to a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H, which demonstrates a highly improved electric conduction.








Abstract
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. Electronic conduction can be enhanced by co&#8208;inserting oxygen acceptors simultaneously. However, the currently used redox approaches hinder protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;insertion due to the selective switching issues. Here, a thermal hydration strategy for systematically exploring the synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. This strategy is illustrated by synthesizing a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H from the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5. Compared to the insulating SrCoO2.5, SrCoO3H exhibits an unprecedented high electronic conductivity above room temperature, water uptake at 250&#160;&#176;C, and a thermoelectric power factor of up to 1.2&#160;mW K&#8722;2 m&#8722;1 at 300 K. These findings open up opportunities for creating high&#8208;conductive protonated layered oxides by protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Proteins for Targeted Cancer Therapy: Prospects and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of various forms of bifunctional proteins (BFPs) for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly popular and important. BFPs can simultaneously act on different components in the tumor microenvironment, which are expected to play a diverse role in combating tumor heterogeneity and improving treatment outcomes. A variety of preclinical and early&#8208;stage clinical studies have reported their great potential in cancer treatment.








Abstract
Bifunctional proteins (BFPs) are a class of therapeutic agents produced through genetic engineering and protein engineering, and are increasingly used to treat various human diseases, including cancer. These proteins usually have two or more biological functions&#8212;specifically recognizing different molecular targets to regulate the related signaling pathways, or mediating effector molecules/cells to kill tumor cells. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule or single&#8208;target drugs, BFPs possess stronger biological activity but lower systemic toxicity. Hence, BFPs are considered to offer many benefits for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors. In this review, the authors briefly describe the unique structural feature of BFP molecules and innovatively divide them into bispecific antibodies, cytokine&#8208;based BFPs (immunocytokines), and protein toxin&#8208;based BFPs (immunotoxins) according to their mode of action. In addition, the latest advances in the development of BFPs are discussed and the potential limitations or problems in clinical applications are outlined. Taken together, future studies need to be centered on understanding the characteristics of BFPs for optimizing and designing more effective such drugs.

         <title>3D Printing of Superhydrophobic Objects with Bulk Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The principle of polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation is exploited to 3D print superhydrophobic objects with bulk nanostructure and unlimited geometrical freedom. The bulk nanoporous structure of the 3D&#8208;printed superhydrophobic objects not only makes them tolerant to abrasion damage, but also opens new possibilities in applications including gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidics, as well as hierarchically structured super oil absorbents.








Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) technologies demands new materials with novel properties and functionalities. Superhydrophobic materials, owing to their ultralow water adhesion, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;biofouling, or superoleophilic properties are useful for myriad applications involving liquids. However, the majority of the methods for making superhydrophobic surfaces have been based on surface functionalization and coatings, which are challenging to apply to 3D objects. Additionally, these coatings are vulnerable to abrasion due to low mechanical stability and limited thickness. Here, a new materials concept and methodology for 3D printing of superhydrophobic macroscopic objects with bulk nanostructure and almost unlimited geometrical freedom is presented. The method is based on a specific ink composed of hydrophobic (meth)acrylate monomers and porogen solvents, which undergoes phase separation upon photopolymerization to generate inherently nanoporous and superhydrophobic structures. Using a desktop Digital Light Processing printer, superhydrophobic 3D objects with complex shapes are demonstrated, with ultralow and uniform water adhesion measured with scanning droplet adhesion microscopy. It is shown that the 3D&#8208;printed objects, owing to their nanoporous structure throughout the entire volume, preserve their superhydrophobicity upon wear damage. Finally, a superhydrophobic 3D&#8208;printed gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidic device and a hierarchically structured 3D&#8208;printed super&#8208;oil&#8208;absorbent are demonstrated.

         <title>Conquering the Hypoxia Limitation for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, the strategies are reviewed that are developed to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades, include delivering exogenous O2, in situ O2 generation, reducing cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O2 during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O2 content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O2 to tumor directly, 2) generating O2 in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O2&#8208;independent Type&#8208;I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.

Additionally, the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-independent Type-I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescent Nanozeolite Receptors for the Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Neurotransmitters in Water and Biofluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent artificial receptors are introduced that bind neurotransmitters with unprecedented affinity and selectivity in biofluids. They are based on nanozeolite hybrid materials and can be used for emission&#8208; and absorbance&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentration, for (two&#8208;photon) imaging, and for label&#8208;free enzymatic reaction monitoring in real time.








Abstract
The design and preparation of synthetic binders (SBs) applicable for small biomolecule sensing in aqueous media remains very challenging. SBs designed by the lock&#8208;and&#8208;key principle can be selective for their target analyte but usually show an insufficient binding strength in water. In contrast, SBs based on symmetric macrocycles with a hydrophobic cavity can display high binding affinities but generally suffer from indiscriminate binding of many analytes. Herein, a completely new and modular receptor design strategy based on microporous hybrid materials is presented yielding zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs) which reversibly bind the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine with unprecedented affinity and selectivity even in saline biofluids. ZARs are thought to uniquely exploit both the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect and direct non&#8208;covalent recognition motifs, which is supported by in&#8208;depth photophysical, and calorimetric experiments combined with full atomistic modeling. ZARs are thermally and chemically robust and can be readily prepared at gram scales. Their applicability for the label&#8208;free monitoring of important enzymatic reactions, for (two&#8208;photon) fluorescence imaging, and for high&#8208;throughput diagnostics in biofluids is demonstrated. This study showcases that artificial receptor based on microporous hybrid materials can overcome standing limitations of synthetic chemosensors, paving the way towards personalized diagnostics and metabolomics.

         <dc:description>
Microwave ovens can be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtaon nanoporous materials. This review covers the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of these diverse nanoporous materials and their potential applications.








Abstract
Usually, porous materials are synthesized by using conventional electric heating, which can be energy&#8208; and time&#8208;consuming. Microwave heating is commonly used in many households to quickly heat food. Microwave ovens can also be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain many of the advanced nanomaterials. This review summarizes the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of diverse groups of nanoporous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted methods afford highly porous materials with high specific surface areas (SSAs), e.g., activated carbons with SSA &#8776;3100 m2 g&#8722;1, metal&#8211;organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;4200&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, covalent organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;2900 m2 g&#8722;1, and metal oxides with relatively small SSA &#8776;300 m2 g&#8722;1. These methods are also successfully implemented for the preparation of ordered mesoporous silicas and carbons as well as spherically shaped nanomaterials. Most of the nanoporous materials obtained under microwave irradiation show potential applications in gas adsorption, water treatment, catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery, among others.

         <title>Manipulating Intratumoral Fenton Chemistry for Enhanced Chemodynamic and Chemodynamic&#8208;Synergized Multimodal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first discusses the advances in reinforcement strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. Then, the multimodal anticancer therapies involving enhanced chemodynamic therapy and mechanisms of synergy are highlighted. Finally, the major challenges and further improvements of this evolving field are elaborated.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses the tumor microenvironment&#8208;assisted intratumoral Fenton reaction for generating highly toxic hydroxyl free radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve selective tumor treatment. However, the limited intratumoral Fenton reaction efficiency restricts the therapeutic efficacy of CDT. Recent years have witnessed the impressive development of various strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. The introduction of these reinforcement strategies can dramatically improve the treatment efficiency of CDT and further promote the development of enhanced CDT (ECDT)&#8208;based multimodal anticancer treatments. In this review, the authors systematically introduce these reinforcement strategies, from their basic working principles, reinforcement mechanisms to their representative clinical applications. Then, ECDT&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapy is discussed, including how to integrate these emerging Fenton reinforcement strategies for accelerating the development of multimodal anticancer therapy, as well as the synergistic mechanisms of ECDT and other treatment methods. Eventually, future direction and challenges of ECDT and ECDT&#8208;based multimodal synergistic therapies are elaborated, highlighting the key scientific problems and unsolved technical bottlenecks to facilitate clinical translation.

         <title>Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic&#8211;Organic Isoporous Membranes with Tunable Pore Sizes and Functionalities for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes are fabricated via sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition within block copolymer membranes followed by addition of functional organic molecules. The membrane pore sizes are controlled by metal oxide growth in a predictive manner. The hybrid membranes exhibit superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2 nm organic molecules and similar&#8208;sized proteins.








Abstract
Accomplishing on&#8208;demand molecular separation with a high selectivity and good permeability is very desirable for pollutant removal and chemical and pharmaceutical processing. The major challenge for sub&#8208;10&#160;nm filtration of particles and molecules is the fabrication of high&#8208;performance membranes with tunable pore size and designed functionality. Here, a versatile top&#8208;down approach is demonstrated to produce such a membrane using isoporous block copolymer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore sizes combined with growth of metal oxide using sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition (SIS and ALD). The pore size of the membranes is tuned by controlled metal oxide growth within and onto the polymer channels, enabling up to twofold pore diameter reduction. Following the growth, the distinct functionalities are readily incorporated along the membrane nanochannels with either hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic groups via straightforward and scalable gas/liquid&#8211;solid interface reactions. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the membrane nanochannel is significantly changed by the introduction of hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic fluorinated groups. The functionalized membranes exhibit a superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2&#160;nm organic molecules and fractionating similar&#8208;sized proteins based on size, charge, and hydrophobicity. This demonstrates the great potential of organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes for high&#8208;performance molecular separation in numerous applications.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Single&#8208;Atom Metal&#8208;Embedded Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrodes for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor, the d&#8208;p hybridization state between single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large&#8208;sized and flexible three&#8208;dimensional electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the single&#8208;atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A descriptor, the &lt;i&gt;d-p&lt;/i&gt; hybridization state between single-atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large-sized and flexible three-dimensional electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that &lt;i&gt;d-p&lt;/i&gt; orbital hybridization between the single-atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li&#8211;S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti-bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single-atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three-dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single-atom Ti-embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single-atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1&#160;wt.%) and a high area-sulfur loading (8&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries for wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Synergistic electrical and optical multimodal sensing by 3D nanoarchitectures for label&#8208;free gas detection.








Abstract
Practical sensing applications such as real&#8208;time safety alerts and clinical diagnoses require sensor devices to differentiate between various target molecules with high sensitivity and selectivity, yet conventional devices such as oxide&#8208;based chemo&#8208;resistive sensors and metal&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors usually do not satisfy such requirements. Here, a label&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;resistive/SERS multimodal sensor based on a systematically assembled 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA), which has unusually strong enhancements in both &#8220;chemo&#8208;resistive&#8221; and &#8220;SERS&#8221; sensing characteristics is introduced. 3D&#8208;CMA combines several sensing mechanisms and sensing elements via 3D integration of semiconducting SnO2 nanowire frameworks and dual&#8208;functioning Au metallic nanoparticles. It is shown that the multimodal sensor can successfully estimate mixed&#8208;gas compositions selectively and quantitatively at the sub&#8208;100 ppm level, even for mixtures of gaseous aromatic compounds (nitrobenzene and toluene) with very similar molecular structures. This is enabled by combined chemo&#8208;resistive and SERS multimodal sensing providing complementary information.

         <title>Electrical Generation and Deletion of Magnetic Skyrmion&#8208;Bubbles via Vertical Current Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to generate and delete magnetic skyrmion&#8208;bubbles electrically is presented using a vertical current path. The vertical current path concept is easy to integrate with a widely used spin&#8211;orbit torque device. Using the vertical current path with a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque device, core operations for a skyrmion racetrack memory device in a three&#8208;terminal device are demonstrated.








Abstract
The magnetic skyrmion is a topologically protected spin texture that has attracted much attention as a promising information carrier because of its distinct features of suitability for high&#8208;density storage, low power consumption, and stability. One of the skyrmion devices proposed so far is the skyrmion racetrack memory, which is the skyrmion version of the domain&#8208;wall racetrack memory. For application in devices, skyrmion racetrack memory requires electrical generation, deletion, and displacement of isolated skyrmions. Despite the progress in experimental demonstrations of skyrmion generation, deletion, and displacement, these three operations have yet to be realized in one device. Here, a route for generating and deleting isolated skyrmion&#8208;bubbles through vertical current injection with an explanation of its microscopic origin is presented. By combining the proposed skyrmion&#8208;bubble generation/deletion method with the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven skyrmion shift, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experimental demonstration of the skyrmion racetrack memory operation in a three&#8208;terminal device structure is provided.

         <title>Construction of Six&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single Ni Sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with Boron&#8208;Oxo Species for Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Activation&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites are successfully anchored by highly dispersed boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. The as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst can realize efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where single Ni atoms can effectively capture photoelectrons and preferentially reduce absorbed water to produce H atoms as active species eventually inducing the reduction of CO2.








Abstract
The configuration regulation of single&#8208;atom photocatalysts (SAPCs) can significantly influence the interfacial charge transfer and subsequent catalytic process. The construction of conventional SAPCs for aqueous CO2 reduction is mainly devoted toward favorable activation and photoreduction of CO2, however, the role of water is frequently neglected. In this work, single Ni atoms are successfully anchored by boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets through a facile ion&#8208;exchange method. The dative interaction between the B atom and the sp2 N atom of g&#8208;C3N4 guarantees the high dispersion of boron&#8208;oxo species, where O atoms coordinate with single Ni (II) sites to obtain a unique six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated configuration. The optimized single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst, rivaling Pt&#8208;modified g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, provides excellent CO2 reduction rate with CO and CH4 as products. Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, transient absorption spectra, isotopic labeling, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that as&#8208;fabricated six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites can effectively capture the photoelectrons of CN along the B&#63743;O bridges and preferentially activate adsorbed water to produce H atoms to eventually induce a hydrogen&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. This work diversifies the synthetic strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides insight on correlation between the single&#8208;atom configuration and reaction pathway.

         <title>Controllable Doping in 2D Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable doping by modulating the thickness is realized in 2D layered materials. The decreasing thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies in thicker PtSSe to anion vacancies in thinner PtSSe, which leads to controllable doping. Thickness&#8208;modulated doping shows great potential in novel electronics and optoelectronics, especially including diodes and photodetectors.








Abstract
For each generation of semiconductors, the issue of doping techniques is always placed at the top of the priority list since it determines whether a material can be used in the electronic and optoelectronic industry or not. When it comes to 2D materials, significant challenges have been found in controllably doping 2D semiconductors into p&#8208; or n&#8208;type, let alone developing a continuous control of this process. Here, a unique self&#8208;modulated doping characteristic in 2D layered materials such as PtSSe, PtS0.8Se1.2, PdSe2, and WSe2 is reported. The varying number of vertically stacked&#8208;monolayers is the critical factor for controllably tuning the same material from p&#8208;type to intrinsic, and to n&#8208;type doping. Importantly, it is found that the thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conductance, respectively. By thickness&#8208;modulated doping, WSe2 diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark&#8208;current in narrow&#8208;bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand&#8208;new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.

Importantly, it is found that the thickness-induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p- and n-type conductance, respectively. By thickness-modulated doping, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open-circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark-current in narrow-bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand-new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Piezo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Sensing of Ascorbic Acid with Nanostructured Wurtzite Zinc Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic sensor is designed for detecting l&#8208;ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in the nanostructured semiconducting zinc oxide catalysts.








Abstract
Nanostructured piezoelectric semiconductors offer unprecedented opportunities for high&#8208;performance sensing in numerous catalytic processes of biomedical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural interests, leveraging piezocatalysis that enhances the catalytic efficiency with the strain&#8208;induced piezoelectric field. Here, a cost&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic sensor for detecting l&#8208;ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments, is designed and demonstrated. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods and nanosheets are prepared to characterize and compare their efficacy for the piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis of AA. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in the nanostructured semiconducting ZnO catalysts. The charge transfer between the strained ZnO nanostructures and AA is elucidated to reveal the mechanism for the related piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic process. The low&#8208;temperature synthesis of high&#8208;quality ZnO nanostructures allows low&#8208;cost, scalable production, and integration directly into wearable electrocatalytic sensors whose performance can be boosted by otherwise wasted mechanical energy from the working environment, for example, human&#8208;generated mechanical signals.

         <title>An Amorphous Peri&#8208;Implant Ligament with Combined Osteointegration and Energy&#8208;Dissipation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament (PIL) is realized using polymer&#8208;infiltrated amorphous titania nanotubes based on a periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture. The PIL not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity by more than 18% bone&#8211;implant contact, but also remarkably reduces stress transfer to the peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium. The PIL will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implant materials with increased lifespans.








Abstract
Progress toward developing metal implants as permanent hard&#8208;tissue substitutes requires both osteointegration to achieve load&#8208;bearing support, and energy&#8208;dissipation to prevent overload&#8208;induced bone resorption. However, in existing implants these two properties can only be achieved separately. Optimized by natural evolution, tooth&#8208;periodontal&#8208;ligaments with fiber&#8208;bundle structures can efficiently orchestrate load&#8208;bearing and energy dissipation, which make tooth&#8211;bone complexes survive extremely high occlusion loads (&gt;300 N) for prolonged lifetimes. Here, a bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament with simultaneously enhanced osteointegration and energy&#8208;dissipation is presented, which is based on the periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture of a polymer&#8208;infiltrated, amorphous, titania nanotube array. The artificial ligament not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity owing to its nanotopography and beneficial ingredients, but also produces periodontium&#8208;similar energy dissipation due to the complexity of the force transmission modes and interface sliding. The ligament increases bone&#8211;implant contact by more than 18% and simultaneously reduces the effective stress transfer from implant to peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium implants, which as far as is known has not previously been achieved. It is anticipated that the concept of an artificial ligament will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implanted materials with increased lifespans.

         <title>Design Principles of Sodium/Potassium Protection Layer for High&#8208;Power High&#8208;Energy Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes: a Case Study of Na2Te/K2Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na2Te (K2Te) protection layer with high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and high mechanical stability on Na (K) metal anode is designed and prepared. Therefore, the Na@Na2Te (K@K2Te) realizes excellent electrochemical performance for sodium (potassium) metal batteries of both symmetrical cells and full batteries in widely used carbonate electrolytes.








Abstract
The sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes combine low&#8208;cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal batteries. However, the dendrites&#8217; growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na2Te/K2Te is beneficial for Na+/K+ transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na+/K+ migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na+/K+ diffusion coefficient of 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1/1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1 (300 K), respectively. Then a Na2Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium&#8208;metal surface. The Na@Na2Te anode can last for 700 h in low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), and the corresponding Na3V2 (PO4)3//Na@Na2Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&#8722;1 as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K2Te&#8208;based potassium&#8208;metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&#8722;1 with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes with simple and low&#8208;cost interfacial layers.

         <title>A Conductive Network and Dipole Field for Harnessing Photogenerated Charge Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2 network exhibits two orders of magnitude enhancement in electric conductivity, which will greatly suppress electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) recombination by reducing the charge&#8208;transfer resistance. In addition, 2D MXene induces a dipole at the interface. The dipole field pushes charge extraction and suppresses charge recombination by inducing band bending.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge separation and directional transfer to active sites are pivotal steps in photocatalysis, which limit the efficiency of redox reactions. Here, a conductive network and dipole field are employed to harness photogenerated charge kinetics by using a Ti3C2/TiO2 network (TTN). The TTN exhibits a prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (1.026&#160;ns) and an 11.76&#8208;fold increase in hexavalent chromium photoreduction reaction kinetics compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). This super photocatalytic performance is derived from the efficient photogenerated charge kinetics, which is steered by the conductive network and dipole field. The conductivity enhancement of the TiO2 network is achieved by continuous chemical bonds, which promotes electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) separation. In addition, at the interface of Ti3C2 and TiO2, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti3C2. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.

In addition, at the interface of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution of Graphene Patterning: From Dimension Regulation to Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene patterning has attracted widespread attention owing to its ability to tailor the structures and properties of graphene, targeting high&#8208;tech applications. The established strategies have been evolved from the initial dimension regulation to the emerging molecular engineering of graphene sheet. In general, these methods can be divided into top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up and chemical patterning routes as comprehensively disused in this review.








Abstract
The realization that nanostructured graphene featuring nanoscale width can confine electrons to open its bandgap has aroused scientists&#8217; attention to the regulation of graphene structures, where the concept of graphene patterns emerged. Exploring various effective methods for creating graphene patterns has led to the birth of a new field termed graphene patterning, which has evolved into the most vigorous and intriguing branch of graphene research during the past decade. The efforts in this field have resulted in the development of numerous strategies to structure graphene, affording a variety of graphene patterns with tailored shapes and sizes. The established patterning approaches combined with graphene chemistry yields a novel chemical patterning route via molecular engineering, which opens up a new era in graphene research. In this review, the currently developed graphene patterning strategies is systematically outlined, with emphasis on the chemical patterning. In addition to introducing the basic concepts and the important progress of traditional methods, which are generally categorized into top&#8208;down, bottom&#8208;up technologies, an exhaustive review of established protocols for emerging chemical patterning is presented. At the end, an outlook for future development and challenges is proposed.

         <title>Volatilizable Solid Additive&#8208;Assisted Treatment Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18.8% and Fill Factor Exceeding 80%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new morphology control approach is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar cells by utilizing the synergistic effect of 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN) and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) additives. This approach exhibits general application in various active layer systems to achieve well&#8208;developed morphology, enabled outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency over 18.8% and fill factor exceeding 80% for the device based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM.








Abstract
Controlling the self&#8208;assembling of organic semiconductors to form well&#8208;developed nanoscale phase separation in the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer is critical yet challenging for building high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the similar anisotropic conjugated structures between nonfullerene acceptors and p&#8208;type organic semiconductor donors raise more complexity on manipulating their aggregation toward appropriate phase separation. Herein, a new approach to tune the morphology of photoactive layer is developed by utilizing the synergistic effect of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN). The volatilizable solid additive DTT with high crystallinity can restrict the over self&#8208;assembling of nonfullerene acceptors during the film casting process, and then allowing the refining of phase separation and molecular packing with the simultaneous volatilization of DTT under thermal annealing. Consequently, the PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM&#8208;based ternary OSCs processed by the dual additives of CN and DTT record a notable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.89%, with a remarkable FF of 80.6%.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Upgraded van der Waals Contacts for Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upgraded van der Waals metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with near&#8208;zero Schottky barrier are realized by the stable, efficient, and non&#8208;residue molecule treatment of reducing the Schottky barrier width, to enable record&#8208;setting performance metrics of atomically thin transistors.








Abstract
The applications of any ultrathin semiconductor device are inseparable from high&#8208;quality metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with designed Schottky barriers. Building van der Waals (vdWs) contacts of 2D semiconductors represents an advanced strategy of lowering the Schottky barrier height by reducing interface states, but will finally fail at the theoretical minimum barrier due to the inevitable energy difference between the semiconductor electron affinity and the metal work function. Here, an effective molecule optimization strategy is reported to upgrade the general vdWs contacts, achieving near&#8208;zero Schottky barriers and creating high&#8208;performance electronic devices. The molecule treatment can induce the defect healing effect in p&#8208;type semiconductors and further enhance the hole density, leading to an effectively thinned Schottky barrier width and improved carrier interface transmission efficiency. With an ultrathin Schottky barrier width of &#8776;2.17&#160;nm and outstanding contact resistance of &#8776;9 k&#937;&#160;&#181;m in the optimized Au/WSe2 contacts, an ultrahigh field&#8208;effect mobility of &#8776;148&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in chemical vapor deposition grown WSe2 flakes is achieved. Unlike conventional chemical treatments, this molecule upgradation strategy leaves no residue and displays a high&#8208;temperature stability at &gt;200 &#176;C. Furthermore, the Schottky barrier optimization is generalized to other metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, including 1T&#8208;PtSe2/WSe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2/WSe2, 2H&#8208;NbS2/WSe2, and Au/PdSe2, defining a simple, universal, and scalable method to minimize contact resistance.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Capacitive Pressure Sensors over a Wide Pressure Range Enabled by the Hybrid Responses of a Highly Porous Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low sensitivity at large pressure is a long&#8208;standing obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. A novel soft capacitive pressure sensor that employs an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite is a promising solution for resolving this chronic challenge. This hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor exhibits unprecedented sensitivity up to 50 kPa. An analytical model explains its mechanism and enables selection of optimal manufacturing parameters.








Abstract
Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3&#160;kPa). To overcome this well&#8208;known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)&#8208;doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1 kPa to 0.43 kPa&#8722;1 within 30&#8211;50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.

         <title>Direct Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure and Electric Field Imaging of Triazine&#8208;Based Crystalline Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy technique reveals the local atomic configuration and also directly determines the atomic electric field of poly(triazine imide) crystal, the triazine&#8208;based crystalline carbon nitride. These findings offer a fundamental insight on the electronic structure for photoabsorption and the migration of charge carriers in photocatalysis with this material.








Abstract
Crystalline carbon nitrides (CNs) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their superior photocatalytic activity. However, the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;sensitive nature of crystalline CNs hinders atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of their local structures by conventional (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques. Here, the atomic structure of a triazine&#8208;based crystalline CN, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) incorporated with lithium and chloride ions, is unambiguously revealed using the emerging imaging technique of differential phase contrast STEM under a low dose. The lightest&#8208;element Li/H configuration is resolved within framework cavities of PTI and significantly affects the electronic structure for photoabsorption. The atomic electric field of PTI crystal directly determined in real space provides a fundamental evidence for the chemical bonding of Li ions and adjacent atoms for the migration of photogenerated carriers. These results facilitate the comprehension on local atomic configuration and chemical bonding state of crystalline CNs and can lead to a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>Coupling Glucose&#8208;Assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) Redox with Electrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new approach is proposed to achieve low voltage and continuous hydrogen production using glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox as anode reaction. Glucose in electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) spontaneously, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a sustainable technology for hydrogen production since this process can utilize the intermittent electricity generated by renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro. However, the large&#8208;scale application of this process is restricted by the high electricity consumption due to the large potential gap (&gt;1.23&#160;V) between the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel and efficient hydrogen production system is developed for coupling glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox with HER. The onset potential of the electrooxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is as low as 0.7 VRHE (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation demonstrates that glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) instantaneously via a thermocatalysis process, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, the electricity consumption for per cubic H2 produced in the system is 2.2&#160;kWh, only half of the value for conventional water electrolysis (4.5&#160;kWh). This work provides a promising strategy for the low&#8208;cost, efficient production of high&#8208;purity H2.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively introduces the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. In particular, the design of functional groups and the dependence of electrolyte pH play important roles to further improve the selectivity of H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environment&#8208;friendly and efficient oxidant with a wide range of applications in different industries. Recently, the production of hydrogen peroxide through direct electrosynthesis has attracted widespread research attention, and has emerged as the most promising method to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step anthraquinone process. In ongoing efforts to achieve highly efficient large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of H2O2, carbon&#8208;based materials have been developed as 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, with the benefits of low cost, abundant availability, and optimal performance. This review comprehensively introduces the strategies for optimizing carbon&#8208;based materials toward H2O2 production, and the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts. The active sites of the carbon&#8208;based materials and the influence of coordination heteroatom doping on the selectivity of H2O2 are extensively analyzed. In particular, the appropriate design of functional groups and understanding the effect of the electrolyte pH are expected to further improve the selective efficiency of producing H2O2 via the oxygen reduction reaction. Methods for improving catalytic activity by interface engineering and reaction kinetics are summarized. Finally, the challenges carbon&#8208;based catalysts face before they can be employed for commercial&#8208;scale H2O2 production are identified, and prospects for designing novel electrochemical reactors are proposed.

         <title>Reborn Three&#8208;Dimensional Graphene with Ultrahigh Volumetric Desalination Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3DG is repeatedly crushed and reshaped to upgrade its overall performance like &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana.&#8221; 3DG is reborn to a higher self as NvG, making it emerge with unprecedented advantages in areas such as capacitive deionization and becoming a new engine to initiate the development of innovative 3D structures for carbon materials.








Abstract
The constructing of 3D materials with optimal performance is urgently needed to meet the growing demand of advanced materials in the high&#8208;tech sector. A distinctive 3D graphene (3DG) is designed based on a repeated rebirth strategy to obtain a better body and performance after each round of rebirth, as if it is Phoenix Nirvana. The properties of reborn graphene, namely 3DG after Nirvana (NvG), has been dramatically upgraded compared to 3DG, including high density (3.36 times) together with high porosity, as well as better electrical conductivity (1.41 times), mechanical strength (32.4 times), and ultrafast infiltration behavior. These advantages of NvG make it a strong intrinsic motivation for application in capacitive deionization (CDI). Using NvG directly as the CDI electrode, it has an extremely high volumetric capacity of 220&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a maximum salt absorption capacity of 8.02~9.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3 (8.9&#8211;10.2 times), while the power consumption for adsorption of the same mass of salt is less than a quarter of 3DG. The &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana&#8221;&#8208;like strategy of manufacturing 3D structures will undoubtedly become the new engine to kick&#8208;start the development of innovative carbon materials through an overall performance upgrade.

The properties of reborn graphene, namely 3DG after Nirvana (NvG), has been dramatically upgraded compared to 3DG, including high density (3.36 times) together with high porosity, as well as better electrical conductivity (1.41 times), mechanical strength (32.4 times), and ultrafast infiltration behavior. These advantages of NvG make it a strong intrinsic motivation for application in capacitive deionization (CDI). Using NvG directly as the CDI electrode, it has an extremely high volumetric capacity of 220&#160;F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum salt absorption capacity of 8.02~9.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; (8.9&#8211;10.2 times), while the power consumption for adsorption of the same mass of salt is less than a quarter of 3DG. The &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana&#8221;-like strategy of manufacturing 3D structures will undoubtedly become the new engine to kick-start the development of innovative carbon materials through an overall performance upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Black Phosphorus Heterostructures with Improved Ambient Stability and Enhanced Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is demonstrated to prepare ambient stable black phosphorus (BP)/hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) hybrid heterostructures. This strategy not only modifies the band structure of BP sheets but also improves their charge mobility, paving the way toward ambient processing and fabrication of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Overcoming the intrinsic instability and preserving unique electronic properties are key challenges for the practical applications of black phosphorus (BP) under ambient conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that molecular heterostructures of BP and hexaazatriphenylene derivatives (BP/HATs) enable improved environmental stability and charge transport properties. The strong interfacial coupling and charge transfer between the HATs and the BP lattice decrease the surface electron density and protect BP sheets from oxidation, resulting in an excellent ambient lifetime of up to 21 d. Importantly, HATs increase the charge scattering time of BP, contributing to an improved carrier mobility of 97 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, almost three times of the pristine BP films, based on noninvasive THz spectroscopic studies. The film mobility is an order of magnitude larger than previously reported values in exfoliated 2D materials. The strategy opens up new avenues for versatile applications of BP sheets and provides an effective method for tuning the physicochemical properties of other air&#8208;sensitive 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Updated Insights into 3D Architecture Electrodes for Micropower Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D architecture electrode design enhances energy storage capability within a limited footprint area. This review comprehensively elucidates the superiority of 3D architecture electrodes for performance improvement of microbatteries and microsupercapacitors. The most recent research advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are outlined and discussed.








Abstract
Microbatteries (MBs) and microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are primary on&#8208;chip micropower sources that drive autonomous and stand&#8208;alone microelectronic devices for implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of conventional MBs and MSCs is restricted by their 2D thin&#8208;film electrode design, and these devices struggle to satisfy the increasing IoT energy demands for high energy density, high power density, and long lifespan. The energy densities of MBs and MSCs can be improved significantly through adoption of a 2D thick&#8208;film electrode design; however, their power densities and lifespans deteriorate with increased electrode thickness. In contrast, 3D architecture electrodes offer remarkable opportunities to simultaneously improve MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. To date, various 3D architecture electrodes have been designed, fabricated, and investigated for MBs and MSCs. This review provides an update on the principal superiorities of 3D architecture electrodes over 2D thick&#8208;film electrodes in the context of improved MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. In addition, the most recent and representative progress in 3D architecture electrode development for MBs and MSCs is highlighted. Finally, present challenges are discussed and key perspectives for future research in this field are outlined.

         <title>Understanding the Synergistic Oxidation in Dichalcogenides through Electrochemiluminescence Blinking at Millisecond Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic oxidation in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is revealed through electrochemiluminescence blinking. The formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxygen migration to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping, which favors the formation of Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Mo, as active sites. This mechanism is universal to transition metal dichalcogenides containing sulfur atoms.








Abstract
The oxidation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been extensively studied and applied in electronics, optics, and energy sources because of its tunable structure and performance. However, due to the lack of appropriate technology, dynamically observe the oxidation process remains an arduous task. Herein, the synergistic oxidation between edge and basal plane in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is observed through electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) blinking with a millisecond resolution. In addition, the ECL method provides a simple, convenient, and quick way to judge structural changes. The transient elevation of the ECL intensity proved the intermittent doping of oxygen at MoS2, which generates O&#8208;atom active sites. High ECL intensity enhanced from the produced hydroperoxide intermediates eases the monitoring of MoS2 particles. Further study shows that the formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the migration of oxygen to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping that favors the formation of Mo&#63743;O&#63743;Mo as new active sites to induce bursts. The revealing of sulfur vacancy&#8208;governed blinking from MoS2 indicates a complex interaction between oxygen and MoS2. The same phenomenon is observed on tungsten disulfide (WS2), which provides new information about the oxidation feature of 2D dichalcogenides.

         <title>Elastic Lattice and Excess Charge Carrier Manipulation in 1D&#8211;3D Perovskite Solar Cells for Exceptionally Long&#8208;Term Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;strictive strain in 3D polycrystalline perovskite is first observed, which can lead to an accelerated ion migration under operational conditions. And the 1D&#8211;3D perovskite, that is, 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film and compensates the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries, can effectively inhibit electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, realizing the ultra&#8208;long operational stability.








Abstract
3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) inherently face severe instability issue due to ion migration under operational conditions. This ion migration inevitably results from the decomposition of ionic bonds under lattice strain and is accelerated by the existence of excess charge carriers. In this study, a 1D&#8211;3D mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite material is explored by adding an organic salt with a bulk benzimidazole cation (Bn+). The Bn+ can induce 3D perovskite crystalline growth with the preferred orientation and form a 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film. For the first time, the electro&#8208;strictive response, which has a significant influence on the lattice strain under an electric field, is observed in polycrystalline perovskite. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite can effectively suppress electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, providing an intrinsically stable lattice with enhanced ionic bonds and fewer excess charge carriers. As a result, the ion migration behavior of the p&#8208;i&#8208;n 1D&#8211;3D based pero&#8208;SC is dramatically suppressed under operational conditions, showing ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability that retains 95.3% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) under operation for 3072 h, and simultaneously achieving an excellent PCE with a hysteresis&#8208;free photovoltaic behavior.

         <title>Bioengineering Approaches for the Advanced Organoid Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of organoid technologies, in terms of development of 3D miniature organs in vitro, has provided revolutionized approaches for understanding developmental processes and disease modeling. Comprehensive insights into the materials and genome engineering techniques applied to organoid culture are demonstrated.

Abstract
Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have enabled scientists to generate stem cell derived organoids that recapitulate the structural and functional characteristics of native organs. Current organoid technologies have been striding toward identifying the essential factors for controlling the processes involved in organoid development, including physical cues and biochemical signaling. There is a growing demand for engineering dynamic niches characterized by conditions that resemble in vivo organogenesis to generate reproducible and reliable organoids for various applications. Innovative biomaterial&#8208;based and advanced engineering&#8208;based approaches have been incorporated into conventional organoid culture methods to facilitate the development of organoid research. The recent advances in organoid engineering, including extracellular matrices and genetic modulation, are comprehensively summarized to pinpoint the parameters critical for organ&#8208;specific patterning. Moreover, perspective trends in developing tunable organoids in response to exogenous and endogenous cues are discussed for next&#8208;generation developmental studies, disease modeling, and therapeutics.

         <title>Engineering Photoresponsive Ligand Tethers for Mechanical Regulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is developed to regulate the behaviors and functions of stem cells by switching the states of light switchable tethers. This method offers the chance to study the mechanotransduction via cellular tethers and realize the spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates.








Abstract
Regulating stem cell functions by precisely controlling the nanoscale presentation of bioactive ligands has a substantial impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but remains a major challenge. Here it is shown that bioactive ligands can become mechanically &#8220;invisible&#8221; by increasing their tether lengths to the substrate beyond a critical length, providing a way to regulate mechanotransduction without changing the biochemical conditions. Building on this finding, light switchable tethers are rationally designed, whose lengths can be modulated reversibly by switching a light&#8208;responsive protein, pdDronpa, in between monomer and dimer states. This allows the regulation of the adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of stem cells by light on substrates of well&#8208;defined biochemical and physical properties. Spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates on the same substrate is further demonstrated, which may represent an important step toward constructing complex organoids or mini tissues by spatially defining the mechanical cues of the cellular microenvironment with light.

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of COFs&#8208;Based Multicomponent Nanocomposites from Core&#8208;Shell to Yolk&#8208;Shell and Hollow&#8208;Sphere Structure for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching strategy to bring about the controllable synthesis of a series of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites from core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere structures is presented. Combining unique yolk&#8208;shell structure with synergistic effect of the three components, the MTCN&#8208;H (ys) demonstrates remarkable catalytic performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O.








Abstract
The precise tuning and multi&#8208;dimensional processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based materials into multicomponent superstructures with appropriate diversity are essential to maximize their advantages in catalytic reactions. However, up to now, it remains an ongoing challenge for the precise design of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites with diverse architectures. Herein, a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching (MSISAE) strategy that enables continuous synthesis of core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere COFs&#8208;based nanocomposites through tuning of core decomposition (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 into TiO2) rate is developed. More importantly, due to the multiple active sites, fast transfer of carriers, increased light utilization ability, et al, one of the obtained samples, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125/TiO2@COF&#8208;366&#8208;Ni&#8208;OH&#8208;HAc (yolk&#8208;shell) with special three components, exhibits high photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency in the gas&#8208;solid mode. The MSISAE strategy developed in this work achieves the precise morphology design and control of multicomponent hybrid composites based on COFs, which may pave a new way in devealoping porous crystalline materials with powerful superstructures for multifunctional catalytic reactions.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Metamaterials with Giant Biaxial Thermal Shrinkage for Enhancing Skin Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper develops unique mechanics&#8208;guided designs and fabrication schemes of liquid crystal elastomer metamaterials that allow access to unprecedented biaxial actuation shrinkage and negative thermal expansion. A low&#8208;temperature synthesis method enables excellent actuation performances at a substantially reduced temperature. Such biocompatible metamaterial is integrated with dressing to develop a shrinkable, hemostatic patch for enhancing skin regeneration.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are a class of soft active materials of increasing interest, because of their excellent actuation and optical performances. While LCEs show biomimetic mechanical properties (e.g., elastic modulus and strength) that can be matched with those of soft biological tissues, their biointegrated applications have been rarely explored, in part, due to their high actuation temperatures (typically above 60&#160;&#176;C) and low biaxial actuation performances (e.g., actuation strain typically below 10%). Here, unique mechanics&#8208;guided designs and fabrication schemes of LCE metamaterials are developed that allow access to unprecedented biaxial actuation strain (&#8722;53%) and biaxial coefficient of thermal expansion (&#8722;33&#160;125&#160;ppm&#160;K&#8722;1), significantly surpassing those (e.g., &#8722;20% and &#8722;5950&#160;ppm&#160;K&#8722;1) reported previously. A low&#8208;temperature synthesis method with use of optimized composition ratios enables LCE metamaterials to offer reasonably high actuation stresses/strains at a substantially reduced actuation temperature (46&#160;&#176;C). Such biocompatible LCE metamaterials are integrated with medical dressing to develop a breathable, shrinkable, hemostatic patch as a means of noninvasive treatment. In vivo animal experiments of skin repair with both round and cross&#8208;shaped wounds demonstrate advantages of the hemostatic patch over conventional strategies (e.g., medical dressing and suturing) in accelerating skin regeneration, while avoiding scar and keloid generation.

h&#8208;BN is one of the most promising inorganic materials of this century with possible applications ranging from aerospace to medicine. It has emerged as an exotic 2D material in the post graphene era, owing to its exciting optoelectrical properties combined with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness.

Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a strong candidate for two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material owing to its exciting optoelectrical properties combined with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Super&#8208;thin h&#8208;BN layers have gained significant attention from the scientific community for many applications, including nanoelectronics, photonics, biomedical, anti&#8208;corrosion, and catalysis, among others. This review provides a systematic elaboration of the structural, electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of h&#8208;BN followed by a comprehensive account of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis strategies for 2D h&#8208;BN, including chemical exfoliation, chemical, and physical vapor deposition, and other methods that have been successfully developed in recent years. It further elaborates a wide variety of processing routes developed for doping, substitution, functionalization, and combination with other materials to form heterostructures. Based on the extraordinary properties and thermal&#8208;mechanical&#8208;chemical stability of 2D&#160;h&#8208;BN, various potential applications of these structures are described.

         <title>Efficient and Spectrally Stable Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing a Cationic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymer as a multifunctional passivator to suppress non&#8208;radiative processes, improve charge transport properties, and inhibit ion migration for blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite semiconductors is reported. As a result, efficient and spectrally stable blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with the emission wavelengths from 485 to 458 nanometres were&#160;achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors have demonstrated remarkable potentials in solution&#8208;processed blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the unsatisfied efficiency and spectral stability responsible for trap&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative losses and halide phase segregation remain the primary unsolved challenges for blue perovskite LEDs. In this study, it is reported that a fluorene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymer can be blended with the perovskite semiconductor to control film formation and optoelectronic properties. As a result, sky&#8208;blue and true&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.08, 0.22) and (0.12, 0.13) at the record external quantum efficiencies of 11.2% and 8.0% were&#160;achieved. In addition, the mixed halide perovskites with the conjugated cationic polymer exhibit excellent spectral stability under external bias. This result illustrates that &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymers have a great potential to realize efficient blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite LEDs with stable electroluminescence.

         <title>Tuning Conjugated Polymer Chain Packing for Stretchable Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky additive molecules residing between amorphous chain networks can disrupt the crystalline ordering of polymer semiconductors. The long&#8208;range crystalline domains are suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin&#8208;film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.








Abstract
In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing&#8208;structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large&#8208;crystal growth is suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge&#8208;carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain&#8208;induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed. By adding DOP to a well&#8208;known conjugated polymer, poly[2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4&#8208;(2H,5H)&#8208;dione&#8208;(E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethene] (DPPTVT), stretchable transistors are obtained with anisotropic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities under strain, and stable current output under strain up to 100%.

2D amorphous MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO heterostructure is first constructed via an isotropic growth process for beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries (Na+, K+, and Zn2+) with outstanding electrochemical performance and superior cyclic stability. The amorphous MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics during cycling.








Abstract
Beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion storage devices are promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion storage devices for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale applications. Nowadays, the most of high&#8208;capacity electrodes are crystal materials. However, these crystal materials with intrinsic anisotropy feature generally suffer from lattice strain and structure pulverization during the electrochemical process. Herein, a 2D heterostructure of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoS3) on reduced graphene surface (denoted as MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO), which exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics for beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ions (Na+, K+, Zn2+) storage is demonstrated. Benefiting from the low volume expansion and small sodiation strain of the MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO, it displays ultralong cycling performance of 40&#8201;000&#160;cycles at 10&#160;A g&#8722;1 for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the as&#8208;constructed 2D heterostructure also delivers superior electrochemical performance when used in Na+ full batteries, solid&#8208;state sodium batteries, K+ batteries, Zn2+ batteries and hybrid supercapacitors, demonstrating its excellent application prospect.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Interactive Fiber Electronics with Visual&#8211;Digital Synergies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal fiber electronics that can simultaneously visualize and digitize mechanical stimulus without external power supply. The novel visual&#8211;digital synergies mechanism endows the fiber electronics with excellent optical and electrical performance, and new temporal&#8211;spatial resolution. Industrial&#8208;level scalable manufacture and recycling are thoroughly demonstrated. This bimodal fiber electronics shows unique application in human&#8211;machine interfaces and underwater sensing.








Abstract
Fiber electronics with mechanosensory functionality are highly desirable in healthcare, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and robotics. Most efforts are committed to optimize the electronically readable interface of fiber mechanoreceptor, while the user interface based on naked&#8208;eye readable output is rarely explored. Here, a scalable fiber electronics that can simultaneously visualize and digitize the mechanical stimulus without external power supply, named self&#8208;powered optoelectronic synergistic fiber sensors (SOEFSs), are reported. By coupling of space and surface charge polarization, a new mechanoluminescent (ML)&#8208;triboelectric synergistic effect is realized. It contributes to remarkable enhancement of both electrical (by 100%) and optical output (by 30%), as well as novel temporal&#8211;spatial resolution mode for motion capturing. Based on entirely new thermoplastic ML material system and spinning process, industrial&#8208;level continuously manufacture and recycling processes of SOEFS are realized. Furthermore, SOEFSs&#8217; application in human&#8211;machine interface, virtual reality, and underwater sensing, rescue, and information interaction is demonstrated.

         <title>Textile Waste Fiber Regeneration via a Green Chemistry Approach: A Molecular Strategy for Sustainable Fashion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a green chemical method for complete separation and regeneration of natural/synthetic blended fabrics, which aims to provide a universal recycling strategy for fast fashion waste and provide a new source of fibers. Besides single&#8208;component fibers, a new composite fiber consisting of cellulose and wool keratin is also regenerated, which presents unique morphology differing from previous studies.








Abstract
Fast fashion, as a continuously growing part of the textile industry, is widely criticized for its excessive resource use and high generation of textiles. To reduce its environmental impacts, numerous efforts are focused on finding sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to textile recycling. However, waste textiles and fibers are still mainly disposed of in landfills or by incineration after their service life and thereby pollute the natural environment, as there is still no effective strategy to separate natural fibers from chemical fibers. Herein, a green chemistry strategy is developed for the separation and regeneration of waste textiles at the molecular level. Cellulose/wool keratin composite fibers and multicomponent fibers are regenerated from waste textiles via a green chemical process.

     alt="Textile Waste Fiber Regeneration via a Green Chemistry Approach: A Molecular Strategy for Sustainable Fashion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a green chemical method for complete separation and regeneration of natural/synthetic blended fabrics, which aims to provide a universal recycling strategy for fast fashion waste and provide a new source of fibers. Besides single-component fibers, a new composite fiber consisting of cellulose and wool keratin is also regenerated, which presents unique morphology differing from previous studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast fashion, as a continuously growing part of the textile industry, is widely criticized for its excessive resource use and high generation of textiles. To reduce its environmental impacts, numerous efforts are focused on finding sustainable and eco-friendly approaches to textile recycling. However, waste textiles and fibers are still mainly disposed of in landfills or by incineration after their service life and thereby pollute the natural environment, as there is still no effective strategy to separate natural fibers from chemical fibers. Herein, a green chemistry strategy is developed for the separation and regeneration of waste textiles at the molecular level. Cellulose/wool keratin composite fibers and multicomponent fibers are regenerated from waste textiles via a green chemical process. The strategy attempts to reduce the large amount of waste textiles generated by the fast-developing fashion industry and provide a new source of fibers, which can also address the fossil fuel reserve shortages caused by chemical fiber industries and global food shortages caused by natural fiber production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Nanoscale Morphology on Charge Carrier Delocalization and Mobility in an Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hole carrier wavefunction is propagated through samples of pentacene with varying levels of structural disorder using surface hopping non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics. It is found that charge carriers are more delocalized, that is, more &#8220;quantum&#8221; than previously thought, even for relatively disordered samples, and establish the mechanism of charge transport as a function of crystallinity.








Abstract
A central challenge of organic semiconductor research is to make cheap, disordered materials that exhibit high electrical conductivity. Unfortunately, this endeavor is hampered by the poor fundamental understanding of the relationship between molecular packing structure and charge carrier mobility. Here a novel computational methodology is presented that fills this gap. Using a melt&#8208;quench procedure it is shown that amorphous pentacene spontaneously self&#8208;assembles to nanocrystalline structures that, at long quench times, form the characteristic herringbone layer of the single crystal. Quantum dynamical simulations of electron hole transport show a clear correlation between the crystallinity of the sample, the quantum delocalization, and the mobility of the charge carrier. Surprisingly, the long&#8208;held belief that charge carriers form relatively localized polarons in disordered OS is only valid for fully amorphous structures&#8212;for nanocrystalline and crystalline samples, significant charge carrier delocalization over several nanometers occurs that underpins their improved conductivities. The good agreement with experimentally available data makes the presented methodology a robust computational tool for the predictive engineering of disordered organic materials.

         <title>Tomoscopy: Time&#8208;Resolved Tomography for Dynamic Processes in Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray tomography, called &#8220;tomoscopy,&#8221; are presented. Tomoscopy provides up to 1000 tomograms per second at &#181;m&#8208;range resolution, running experiments for minutes without interruption. Tomoscopy is applied to study various dynamic processes in materials science.








Abstract
The structure and constitution of opaque materials can be studied with X&#8208;ray imaging methods such as 3D tomography. To observe the dynamic evolution of their structure and the distribution of constituents, for example, during processing, heating, mechanical loading, etc., 3D imaging has to be fast enough. In this paper, the recent developments of time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray tomography that have led to what one now calls &#8220;tomoscopy&#8221; are briefly reviewed A novel setup is presented and applied that pushes temporal resolution down to just 1&#160;ms, that is, 1000&#160;tomograms per second (tps) are acquired, while maintaining spatial resolutions of micrometers and running experiments for minutes without interruption. Applications recorded at different acquisition rates ranging from 50 to 1000&#160;tps are presented. The authors observe and quantify the immiscible hypermonotectic reaction of AlBi10 (in wt%) alloy and dendrite evolution in AlGe10 (in wt%) casting alloy during fast solidification. The combustion process and the evolution of the constituents are analyzed in a burning sparkler. Finally, the authors follow the structure and density of two metal foams over a long period of time and derive details of bubble formation and bubble ageing including quantitative analyses of bubble parameters with millisecond temporal resolution.

         <title>Rational Design and General Synthesis of Multimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nano&#8208;Octahedra for Enhanced Li&#8211;S Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Mn&#8208;based multimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nano&#8208;octahedra are prepared. The synthetic strategy is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano&#8208;octahedra could not be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs, which also allows for the general synthesis of various micro&#8208;/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which consist of central metal nodes and organic linkers, constitute a fast growing class of crystalline porous materials with excellent application potential. Herein, a series of Mn&#8208;based multimetallic MOF (bimetallic and trimetallic MIL&#8208;100) nano&#8208;octahedra are prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy. The types and proportions of the incorporated elements can be tuned while retaining the original topological structure. The introduction of other metal ions is verified at the atomic level by combining X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, these multimetallic Mn&#8208;based MIL&#8208;100 nano&#8208;octahedra are utilized as sulfur hosts to prepare cathodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The MnNi&#8208;MIL&#8208;100@S cathode exhibits the best Li&#8211;S battery performance among all reported MIL&#8208;100@S composite cathode materials, with a reversible capacity of &#8776;708.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. The synthetic strategy described herein is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano&#8208;octahedra cannot be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs. Importantly, the strategy also allows for the general synthesis and study of various micro&#8208;/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Circular&#8208;Economy Recycling for Proteins: Proof of Concept</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of peptides and high&#8208;tech proteins (silk fibroins, &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films) are depolymerized into their amino acid components. Such amino acids are used as the only source of monomers for polymerizing biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase), outside living organisms. The process is repeated multiple times showing that sequence&#8208;defined polymers can be recycled by fulfilling the principles of circular economy.








Abstract
The billion tons of synthetic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based materials (i.e. plastics) produced yearly are a great challenge for humanity. Nature produces even more natural polymers, yet they are sustainable. Proteins are sequence&#8208;defined natural polymers that are constantly recycled when living systems feed. Digestion is the protein depolymerization into amino acids (the monomers) followed by their re&#8208;assembly into new proteins of arbitrarily different sequence and function. This breaks a common recycling paradigm where a material is recycled into itself. Organisms feed off of random protein mixtures that are &#8220;recycled&#8221; into new proteins whose identity depends on the cell's specific needs. In this study, mixtures of several peptides and/or proteins are depolymerized into their amino acid constituents, and these amino acids are used to synthesize new fluorescent, and bioactive proteins extracellularly by using an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;free, cell&#8208;free transcription&#8211;translation (TX&#8211;TL) system. Specifically, three peptides (magainin II, glucagon, and somatostatin 28) are digested using thermolysin first and then using leucine aminopeptidase. The amino acids so produced are added to a commercial TX&#8211;TL system to produce fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, proteins with high relevance in materials engineering (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films, used for water filtration, or silk fibroin solutions) are successfully recycled into biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase).

         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) with bioinspired strain&#8208;dependent microcrack structure has been designed and fabricated. The SPMSS demonstrates ultrasensitive sensing performances including ultralow detection limit, ultrahigh sensitivity, and ultrafast response. The SPMSS displays tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence features for visual sensing and exhibits excellent triboelectric nanogenerator properties for reliable power source supply and self&#8208;powered sensing.








Abstract
Smart skin is highly desired to be ultrasensitive and self&#8208;powered as the medium of artificial intelligence. Here, an ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) inspired by the luminescence mechanism of cephalopod skin and the ultrasensitive response of spider&#8208;slit&#8208;organ is developed. Benefitting from the unique strain&#8208;dependent microcrack structure design based on Ti3C2Tx (MXene)/carbon nanotube synergistic interaction, SPMSS possesses excellent strain sensing performances including ultralow detection limit (0.001% strain), ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor, GF = 3.92 &#215; 107), ultrafast response time (5&#160;ms), and superior durability and stability (&gt;45&#8201;000 cycles). Synchronously, SPMSS exhibits tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence (ML) features under stretching. A relationship between ML features, strain sensing performances, and the deformation has been established successfully. Importantly, the SPMSS demonstrates excellent properties as triboelectric nanogenerator (4 &#215; 4 cm2), including ultrahigh triboelectric output (open&#8208;circuit voltage VOC&#160;= 540&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current ISC&#160;= 42 &#181;A, short&#8208;circuit charge QSC&#160;= 317 nC) and power density (7.42 W m&#8722;2), endowing the smart skin with reliable power source supply and self&#8208;powered sensing ability. This bioinspired smart skin exhibits multifunctional applications in health monitoring, visual sensing, and self&#8208;powered sensing, showing great potential in artificial intelligence.

         <title>Synergistic Therapy of a Naturally Inspired Glycopolymer&#8208;Based Biomimetic Nanomedicine Harnessing Tumor Genomic Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by saccharide unit and its weak interactions and combined advantages of branched polymers, glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a conjugates are optimized for enhanced PDT, effective olaparib incorporation, and naturally tumor cell membrane modified ability. The obtained biomimetic nanomedicine with homotypic cancer targeting ability achieves a prominent antitumor effect via harnessing tumor genomic instability, providing a platform strategy for synergistic nanomedicines combat with cancer.








Abstract
Inspired by natural saccharide&#8208;protein complexes, a stimuli&#8208;responsive biodegradable and branched glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) conjugate (BSP) with saccharide units for cancer therapy is constructed. A linear glycopolymeric conjugate (LSP), a branched glycopolymeric conjugate (BShP) from Ppa with long carbon chains, and a branched conjugate (BHSP) based on poly[N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (polyHPMA) without saccharide units are prepared as controls. Through structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, BSP with a 3D network structure forms stable nanostructures via weak intermolecular interactions, regulating the stacking state of Ppa to improve the singlet oxygen quantum yield and the corresponding photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect. BSP shows high loading of olaparib, and are further coated with tumor cell membranes, resulting in a biomimetic nanomedicine (CM&#8208;BSPO). CM&#8208;BSPO shows highly efficient tumor targeting and cellular internalization properties. The engulfment of CM&#8208;BSPO accompanied with laser irradiation results in a prominent antitumor effect, evidenced by disruption of cell cycles in tumor cells, increased apoptosis and DNA damage, and subsequent inhibition of repair for damaged DNA. The mechanism for the synergistic effect from PDT and olaparib is unveiled at the genetic and protein level through transcriptome analysis. Overall, this biodegradable and branched glycopolymer&#8211;drug conjugate could be effectively optimized as a biomimetic nanomedicine for cancer therapy.

         <title>Calcium Phosphate&#8208;Reinforced Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Regulate Adenosine&#8208;Mediated Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate&#8208;reinforced iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs) are designed to reduce adenosine accumulation and to inhibit adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response. CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs regulate the adenosine metabolism by promoting adenosine kinase&#8208;mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs enhance the antitumor immune response via adenosine regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes.








Abstract
Long&#8208;term accumulation of adenosine (Ado) in tumor tissues helps to establish the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and to promote tumor development. Regulation of Ado metabolism is particularly pivotal for blocking Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. The activity of adenosine kinase (ADK) for catalyzing the phosphorylation of Ado plays an essential role in regulating Ado metabolism. Specifically, accumulated Ado in the tumor microenvironment occupies the active site of ADK, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Ado. Phosphate can protect ADK from inactivation and restore the activity of ADK. Herein, calcium phosphate&#8208;reinforced iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs) are designed to reduce Ado accumulation and to inhibit Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response in the tumor microenvironment. CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs are found to regulate the Ado metabolism by promoting ADK&#8208;mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs can enhance the antitumor immune response via Ado regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes. Finally, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs are used for cancer treatment in mice, alleviating the Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response and achieving tumor suppression. This study may offer a general strategy for blocking the Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and further for enhancing the immunotherapy efficacy in vivo.

         <title>NanoRobotic Structures with Embedded Actuation via Ion Induced Folding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel fabrication method for 4D nanorobotic systems via ion&#8208;induced folding is introduced. By tailoring the patterning and folding parameters, dynamic 4D microstructures with personalized properties are achieved using planar multilayer structures obtained by batch fabrication. High nanorobotic performances have been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally through a folded gripper.








Abstract
4D structures are tridimensional structures with time&#8208;varying abilities that provide high versatility, sophisticated designs, and a broad spectrum of actuation and sensing possibilities. The downsizing of these structures below 100 &#956;m opens up exceptional opportunities for many disciplines, including photonics, acoustics, medicine, and nanorobotics. However, it requires a paradigm shift in manufacturing methods, especially for dynamic structures. A novel fabrication method based on ion&#8208;induced folding of planar multilayer structures embedding their actuation is proposed&#8212;the planar structures are fabricated in bulk through batch microfabrication techniques. Programmable and accurate bidirectional foldings (&#8722;70&#176;&#160;&#8722;&#160;+90&#176;) of Silica/Chromium/Aluminium (SiO2/Cr/Al) multilayer structures are modeled, experimentally demonstrated then applied to embedded electrothermal actuation of controllable and dynamic 4D nanorobotic structures. The method is used to produce high&#8208;performances case&#8208;study grippers for nanorobotic applications in confined environments. Once folded, a gripping task at the nano&#8208;scale is demonstrated. The proposed fabrication method is suitable for creating small&#8208;scale 4D systems for nanorobotics, medical devices, and tunable metamaterials, where rapid folding and enhanced dynamic control are required.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is developed to improve grain growth of the all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films. MSAC enables more active mass transfer and interaction among precursor colloids. The devices based on the MSAC strategy show much increased efficiency to as high as 19.83% with open&#8208;circuit voltage as high as 1.2&#160;V.

Dynamic manipulation of crystallization is pivotal to the quality of polycrystalline films. A molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is presented to improve grain growth of the all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films. Compared with the traditional solvent annealing, MSAC enables more intensive mass transfer by means of convection and diffusion, which is beneficial to the interaction among the precursor colloids and to inducing in&#8208;plane growth of perovskite grains, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with suppressed pinhole and crack formation. Additionally, the introduction of molten salt alters the intermediate phases, and thus changes the crystallization pathways by reducing the energy barrier to produce films with desired optical and electrical properties. As a result, the MSAC strategy endows the devices with champion steady&#8208;state output efficiency of 19.83% and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) as high as 1.2&#160;V, among the highest for this type of solar cell, thanks to its effectively reduced Voc deficit.

&lt;p&gt;A molten-salt-assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is developed to improve grain growth of the all-inorganic perovskite films. MSAC enables more active mass transfer and interaction among precursor colloids. The devices based on the MSAC strategy show much increased efficiency to as high as 19.83% with open-circuit voltage as high as 1.2&#160;V.

A subcutaneous injectable near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered theranostic nitric oxide nanogenerator is bioengineered to maintain hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) stability by repressing ubiquitination&#8208;mediated protein degradation and promote diabetic ulcer healing. This nanogenerator is also capable of early detection and elimination of wound infections.








Abstract
Current treatments for diabetic ulcers (DUs) remain unsatisfactory due to the risk of bacterial infection and impaired angiogenesis during the healing process. The increased degradation of polyubiquitinated hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) compromises wound healing efficacy. Therefore, the maintenance of HIF&#8208;1&#945; protein stability might help treat DU. Nitric oxide (NO) is an intrinsic biological messenger that functions as a ubiquitination flow repressor and antibacterial agent; however, its clinical application in DU treatment is hindered by the difficulty in controlling NO release. Here, an intelligent near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered NO nanogenerator (SNP@MOF&#8208;UCNP@ssPDA&#8208;Cy7/IR786s, abbreviated as SNP@UCM) is presented. SNP@UCM represses ubiquitination&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation of HIF&#8208;1&#945; by inhibiting its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases under NIR irradiation. Increased HIF&#8208;1&#945; expression in endothelial cells by SNP@UCM enhances angiogenesis in wound sites, promoting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and cell proliferation and migration. SNP@UCM also enables early detection of wound infections and ROS&#8208;mediated killing of bacteria. The potential clinical utility of SNP@UCM is further demonstrated in infected full&#8208;thickness DU model under NIR irradiation. SNP@UCM is the first reported HIF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;stabilizing advanced nanomaterial, and further materials engineering might offer a facile, mechanism&#8208;based method for clinical DU management.
