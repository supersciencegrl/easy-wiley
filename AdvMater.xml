         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co/Mo Sites Anchored on Mesoporous Carbon Hollow Spheres for Highly Selective Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Co/Mo sites anchored on mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS) are designed via template&#8208;engaged strategy for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. Owing to the mesoporous hollow merits and electron&#8208;donating effect from Mo species, the Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS electrocatalyst displays efficient two&#8208;electron pathway with high hydrogen peroxide selectivity, and stable operation in acid.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in acidic media is a promising route for the decentralized and on&#8208;site hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. Nevertheless, strong interaction between active sites and *OOH intermediates usually induces the O&#9472;O bond cleavage to convert 2e&#8722; pathway into the sluggish 4e&#8722; ORR. Therefore, it is highly necessary to optimize the electronic structure of 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts for the regulation of adsorption energy. Herein, we propose the utilization of atomically dispersed Co/Mo sites anchored on mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS) via a template&#8208;engaged strategy for highly selective ORR to H2O2 in acid. Benefitting from the electron&#8208;donating effect of Mo atoms, an enriched electron density around the Co center for Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS is observed, resulting in optimal adsorption of the key *OOH intermediates to approach the apex of 2e&#8722; ORR volcano plot. Moreover, the introduction of Mo species simultaneously suppresses the electroreduction of as&#8208;obtained H2O2 on Co sites. As a consequence, Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS delivers a high H2O2 selectivity of 90&#8211;95% in acid. The flow cell based on the Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 2102&#160;mg for 150&#160;h. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to other early transition metal elements with similar electronic modifier effects.

         <title>Lithium Bond&#8208;Mediated Molecular Cascade Hydrogel for Injury&#8208;Free and Repositionable Adhesive Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions. Researchers designed a lithium bond&#8208;mediated molecular cascade hydrogel for bioelectronic interfaces, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.








Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non&#8208;damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond&#8208;mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25&#160;kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

         <title>Controlled Modulation of Intrinsic Electron Response in C/CoxTy Nanoplates Toward Multispectral Excitation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the C/CoxTy nanoplates with high&#8208;efficiency and tunable electromagnetic properties are successfully prepared by customizing Co&#8208;based nanoparticles. Relying on these C/CoxTy nanoplates, a series of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices are developed, opening up a new era of multispectral electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Electromagnetic materials with adjustable dielectric and magnetic properties are constantly sought after in electronic and industrial fields. In this study, an innovative strategy that customizes anchored Co&#8208;based nanoparticles to optimize the electronic behaviors is proposed for the first time, enabling a controllable and high&#8208;efficiency evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic response of Co&#8208;based (C/CoxTy) nanoplates across the X&#8208;ray, light in the solar band and gigahertz band. Specifically, in the gigahertz band, the C/Co and C/Co3Se4 nanoplates with high&#8208;power loss capabilities can effectively attenuate and convert electromagnetic energy into heat energy, which not only prevents space electromagnetic radiation but also powers energy for various electromagnetic devices such as thermoelectric generators and microwave actuators. Moreover, multiband antennas and ultra&#8208;wideband bandstop filters are successfully achieved and flexibly tuned. Meanwhile, C/CoxTy nanoplates photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors are constructed successfully. Additionally, the C/CoTe nanoplate X&#8208;ray detector, featuring remarkable stability, sensitivity and penetrability, is successfully utilized to construct the interaction system integrating communication and imaging. In summary, this work offers an effective way for flexible regulation of multispectral electromagnetic response, significantly advancing the development of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices.

         <title>Residual Al Adatoms Driven Epitaxy of AlGaN QWs for High&#8208;Performance UV LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic&#8208;level controllable growth of composition&#8208;engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom&#8208;assisted incorporation&#8208;enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifetime ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329&#160;nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280&#8211;330&#160;nm wavelength range, known as the &#8220;UVB gap&#8221;. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga&#8208;adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga&#8208;adatoms during the growth of low&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high&#8208;quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high&#8208;efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

         <title>Integration of Photodiagnosis and Therapy Guided by Micro/Nanorobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes recent key developments in the field of micro/nanorobots (MNRs) integrated with phototherapy, highlights the critical roles of MNRs&#8208;assisted phototherapy in clinical applications, and provides insights into future directions and the pathway toward large&#8208;scale clinical implementation.








Abstract
Micro/Nanorobots(MNRs)integrated with phototherapy represent an emerging approach to cancer treatment and hold significant potential for addressing bacterial infections, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and related conditions. By leveraging micro/nanoscale motor systems in conjunction with phototherapy, these robots enable real&#8208;time guidance and monitoring of therapeutic processes, improving drug delivery precision and efficiency. This integration not only enhances the effectiveness of phototherapy but also minimizes damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Nevertheless, clinical translation of MNRs&#8208;assisted phototherapy still faces numerous challenges. In this review, recent key developments in the field are comprehensively summarized, the critical roles of MNRs&#8208;assisted phototherapy in clinical applications are highlighted, and insights into future directions and the pathway toward large&#8208;scale clinical implementation are provided.

         <title>Flexible Patterned Fuel Cell Patches Stimulate Nerve and Myocardium Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research develops an encapsulation&#8208;free, patterned flexible fuel cell patch (PFCP) with the capability to generate electrostimulation with precisely controlled pattern distributions by adjusting electrode configurations. The inherent adhesion and flexibility properties of the PFCP underpin its performance in vivo. The research introduces a novel and promising tool for accelerating tissue repair via the application of patterned electrostimulation.








Abstract
The distribution of electrical potentials and current in exogenous electrostimulation has significant impacts on its effectiveness in promoting tissue repair. However, there is still a lack of a flexible, implantable power source capable of generating customizable patterned electric fields for in situ electrostimulation(electrical stimulation). Herein, this study reports a fuel cell patch (FCP) that can provide in situ electrostimulation and a hypoxic microenvironment to promote tissue repair synergistically. Stable and highly efficient PtNi nanochains and PtNi nanocages electrocatalysts with anti&#8208;interference properties catalyze glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction respectively in an encapsulation&#8208;free fuel cell. The laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) electrode loaded with PtNi electrocatalysts is transferred to the surface of a flexible chitosan hydrogel. The resulting flexible FCP can adapt to tissues with different morphologies, firmly adhere to prevent suturing, and provide potent electrostimulation (0.403&#160;V, 51.55&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;2). Additionally, it consumes oxygen in situ to create a hypoxic microenvironment, increasing the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;). Based on the different pattern requirements of exogenous electrostimulation during the repair of various types of tissue, an axial FCP for peripheral nerves and a flower&#8208;patterned FCP for myocardial tissue are constructed and transplanted into animals, showing significant tissue repair in both models.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities for Rechargeable Aqueous Sn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable aqueous batteries with metal anodes promise enhanced energy density, combining higher output voltage and capacity with high safety. This perspective highlights the emerging potential of the Sn metal anode, emphasizing its resistance to hydrogen evolution, high reversibility, and sustainability. Key challenges, including dead Sn formation and electrolyte evolution, as well as innovative design strategies for robust Sn&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. The development of Sn metal batteries could contribute to a sustainable society.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries based on metallic anodes hold tremendous potential of high energy density enabled by the combination of relatively low working potential and large capacity while retaining the intrinsic safety nature and economical value of aqueous systems; However, the realization of these promised advantages relies on the identification of an ideal metal anode chemistry with all these merits. In this review, the emerging Sn metal anode chemistry is examined as such an anode candidate in both acidic and alkaline media, where the inertness of Sn toward hydrogen evolution, flat low voltage profile, and low polarization make it a unique metal anode for aqueous batteries. From a panoramic viewpoint, the key challenges and detrimental issues of Sn metal batteries are discussed, including dead Sn formation, self&#8208;discharge, and electrolyte degradation, as well as strategies for mitigating these issues by constructing robust Sn anodes. New design approaches for more durable and reliable Sn metal batteries are also discussed, with the aim of fully realizing the potential of Sn anode chemistry.

         <title>Tuning Transition Metal 3d Spin state on Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of P into a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst is shown to induce a shift in its electronic configuration toward a high spin state. This is proposed to enhance electron back donation via the dxz/dyz&#8208;&#960;* bond, which improves *COOH adsorption and facilitates the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO.








Abstract
Tuning transition metal spin states potentially offers a powerful means to control electrocatalyst activity. However, implementing such a strategy in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) is challenging since rational design rules have yet to be elucidated. Here we show how the addition of P dopants to a ferromagnetic element (Fe, Co, and Ni) single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) can shift its spin state. For instance, with Fe SAC, P dopants enable a switch from low spin state (dx2&#8208; y20, dz20, dxz2, dyz1, dxy2) in Fe&#8208;N4 to high spin state (dx2&#8208;y20, dxz1, dyz1, dz21, dxy2) in Fe&#8208;N3&#8208;P. This is studied using a suite of characterization efforts, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. When used for CO2R, the SAC with Fe&#8208;N3&#8208;P active sites yields &gt;&#160;90% Faradaic efficiency to CO over a wide potential window of &#8776;530&#160;mV and a maximum CO partial current density of &#8776;600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal that high spin state Fe3+ exhibits enhanced electron back donation via the dxz/dyz&#8208;&#960;* bond, which enhances *COOH adsorption and promotes CO formation. Taken together, the results show how the SAC spin state can be intentionally tuned to boost CO2R performance.

         <title>Recent Progress in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Toward Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis and Cooperative Coupling of Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e&#8315; ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e&#8722; ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e&#8211; ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&#8722; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&#8722; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&#8722; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts of 2e&#8722; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&#8722; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H2O2 electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.

To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state-of-the-art catalysts of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Mediated Multi&#8208;Ferroelectric Coupling in Highly Strained EuO&#8208;Graphene Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;ferroelectric effects in van der Waals EuO/graphene heterostructures emerge via a topotactic method, inducing high compressive strain. This strain stabilizes a ferroelectric state up to room temperature, coexisting with the magnetic proximity effect in graphene. These intertwined magneto&#8208;electric effects enable control of magnetization and polarization, offering the potential for next&#8208;gen memory and neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
2D van der Waals materials and their heterostructures are a fantastic playground to explore emergent phenomena arising from electronic quantum hybridization effects. In the last decade, the spin&#8208;dependant hybridization effect pushed this frontier further introducing the magnetic proximity effect as a promising tool for spintronic applications. Here the uncharted proximity&#8208;controlled magnetoelectric effect in EuO/graphene heterostructure is unveiled. This is obtained while creating a new multiferroic hybrid heterostructure with multifunctional properties. Using a topotactic method magnetic insulating EuO thin films on graphene is grown under high compressive strain, which induces the appearance of an additional ferroelectric order, with an electric polarization that reaches up to 18 &#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. This observation therefore quantitatively confirms the theoretical predictions made 15 years ago of a strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric state in EuO. Moreover, the EuO induces a magnetic proximity state into the graphene layer by interfacial hybridization. This new ferroelectric state in the EuO/graphene heterostructure is stable up to room temperature where it coexists with the EuO/graphene magnetic state. Furthermore, intertwined magneto&#8208;electric effects are shown in these strained heterostructures which can facilitate the manipulation of magnetization and electric polarization in future memory and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Broadband Chiroptics with Twist&#8208;stacked Hyperbolic Conducting Polymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic conducting polymer films can exhibit optical hyperbolic properties which here are found connected to large birefringence and linear dichroism. Off&#8208;axis twist&#8208;stacking of only two such subwavelength films can therefore enable large and broadband circular dichroism (CD), with CD bandwidth closely related to the hyperbolic bandwidth. The study demonstrates the general concept using twist&#8208;stacked stretched PEDOT films.








Abstract
Chiral&#8208;specific interaction of light with organic materials is important but typically arises from circular polarization&#8208;dependent absorption of specific optical transitions, resulting in narrow effective wavelength ranges. This study presents a scalable and universal concept for broadband circular dichroism (CD) enabled by strained conducting polymer thin films that possess in&#8208;plane hyperbolic optical behavior (i.e., optically metallic and dielectric properties along orthogonal directions). It is shown that off&#8208;axis stacking of two or more such thin films provides broadband CD that varies with the hyperbolic bandwidth and stacking geometry. By contrast to traditional chiroptical materials, the CD can also be modulated by redox&#8208;tuning of the hyperbolic polymer properties, opening for broadband dynamic chiroptical components.

         <title>Molecular Chain Interpenetration&#8211;Enabled High Interfacial Compatibility of Ionic and Electronic Conductors for Stretchable Ionic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high interfacial compatibility of ionic and electronic conductors is achieved via molecular chain interpenetration. With the benefit of the interface, the fabricated reversible adhesive electrode exhibits a high shear strength of 317&#160;kPa at a low voltage of 4&#160;V, and the ionic diode and transistor maintain stable semiconductor characteristics under arbitrary deformation.








Abstract
Ionic devices find applications such as flexible electronics and biomedicines and function by exploiting hybrid circuits of mobile ions and electrons. However, the poor interfacial compatibility of hard electronic conductors with soft ionic conductors in ionic devices leads to low deformability, sensitivity, electromechanical responses, and stability. Herein, an interpenetrating interface between silicone&#8208;modified polyurethane/carbon nanotube electronic conductors and ionoelastomers in an ionic device using in situ polymerization is fabricated. A robust interpenetrating electronic/ionic conductor interface is realized through molecular chain entanglement and molecular forces (such as ion&#8208;dipole interactions and H&#8208;bonds), effectively enhancing the bonding strength and contact area between the components and resulting in an excellent flexibility, stability, and device performance. The electroadhesive prepared based on this strategy exhibits a superrobust shear strength of 317&#160;kPa under a reduced voltage input of &#8722;4&#160;V, and the diode and the transistor can undergo arbitrary deformation while maintaining the semiconductor device characteristics, including rectification and switching. In addition, electromechanical transducers exhibit sensitive electrical responses to various deformation signals. This solution to the interfacial compatibility problems of electronic and ionic conductors holds promise for the development of multifunctional ionic devices.

         <title>Compression&#8208;Durable Soft Electronic Circuits Enabled by Embedding Self&#8208;Healing Biphasic Liquid&#8208;Solid Metal Into Microstructured Elastomeric Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compressible, stretchable conductor combining liquid (GalnSn) and solid (BilnSn) metals is designed. The solid layer resists compression, while the liquid layer self&#8208;heals cracks under strain. Embedded micropillars enhance durability, enabling stable conductivity under extreme pressure (38.2 MPa) and cyclic loads. This biphasic design allows high&#8208;resolution manufacturing of robust antennas and circuits for soft electronics.








Abstract
Compression strongly degrades the electrical conductivity of the liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based circuits because the liquid state is prone to be squashed. Here, a new compressible and stretchable biphasic liquid&#8208;solid self&#8208;healing circuit is proposed by filling GalnSn&#8208;BilnSn biphasic metal into micropillar&#8208;embedded channels. The underlying BilnSn solid alloy layer serves as a compression resistance layer, while the upper GalnSn liquid metal layer enables the real&#8208;time filling of the cracks in the solid layer under large deformations, resulting in autonomous self&#8208;healing and maintenance of conductivity under both stretching and compression. The embedded micropillars further improved the compression durability by providing additional mechanical support. The synergistic effect between the biphasic materials and embedded micropillar enables the designed stretchable conductor to show stable performance (R/R0&lt;10) under pressure of 38.2&#160;MPa (&#8776;389.5 Kgf&#160;cm&#8722;2) and cyclic pressure of 15.8&#160;MPa over 7000 cycles (R/R0&lt;0.48%) without compromising the stretchability, whereas the liquid metal&#8208;based conductor can only endure pressure up to 2.5&#160;MPa (25.49 Kgf&#160;cm&#8722;2). The stretchable antenna and hybrid circuits fabricated using the designed biphasic metal conductor showed enhanced compression durability. The structure&#8208;confined filling strategy enabled high&#8208;resolution and scalable manufacturing. Overall, robust stability under compression significantly expands the range of possible applications of liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based conductors in soft electronics.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Retina by Regulating Ion&#8208;Confined Transport in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio&#8208;inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high&#8208;performance machine vision. Herein, an ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions.

&lt;p&gt;An ion-confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio-inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio-inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high-performance machine vision. Herein, an ion-confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio-inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine-tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio-inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Controlled Reversible Li Plating&#8208;Stripping for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface&#8208;protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life&#8208;span anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources with low&#8208;cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating&#8208;stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly&#8208;ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface&#8208;coated lithium&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. The assembled half&#8208;cell stably works at 1.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre&#8208;deposition, full&#8208;cells using modified&#8208;LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150&#8208;cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2C rate.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Non&#8208;Volatile Reconfigurable Phase Change Topological Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an on&#8208;chip non&#8208;volatile reconfigurable THz topological silicon chip that integrates a waveguide&#8208;cavity coupled system with phase&#8208;change material, Ge2Sb2Te5, enabling persistent and efficient functionality without constant power input. This advancement significantly paves the way for integrating phase change materials into silicon topological chips for programmable photonic devices, including interconnects, modulators, phase shifters, and logic circuits.








Abstract
Programmable on&#8208;chip terahertz (THz) topological photonic devices are poised to address the rising need for high&#8208;capacity data systems, offering broad bandwidth, minimal loss, and reconfigurability. However, current THz topological chips rely on volatile tuning mechanisms that require continuous power to function. Here, a nonvolatile, programmable THz topological silicon chip is demonstrated that integrates a waveguide&#8208;cavity coupled system with phase&#8208;change material, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), enabling persistent and efficient functionality without constant power input. Through precise tuning of the intermediate phase states of GST between amorphous and crystalline forms, a stable, non&#8208;volatile reconfiguration of the topological cavity is achieved, enabling transitions across over&#8208;coupling, critical coupling, and under&#8208;coupling states. Multi&#8208;level modulation of resonance transmission with a modulation depth of 70 dB is demonstrated, enabling precise control over the onset and disappearance of resonance modes and dynamic tuning of critical coupling states. The THz topological chip facilitates phototunable, volatile modulation across nonvolatile configurations, allowing controlled resetting of the coupling states of the cavity. Here, the first nonvolatile, programmable terahertz topological integrated chip is demonstrated, offering flexible control over resonance modes. This advancement significantly paves the way for integrating phase change materials into silicon topological chips for programmable photonic devices, including interconnects, modulators, and logic circuits.

         <title>Mechanical and Light Activation of Materials for Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The actuation of stomata&#8212;referring to their opening and closing&#8212;is crucial for photosynthesis because it regulates gas exchange and water balance. Here, it is investigated if this life&#8208;like property could enhance the photocatalytic properties of soft materials. A hybrid supramolecular and covalent polymer hydrogel is developed to integrate photocatalytic chromophores and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties for controlling or improving light&#8208;driven superoxide or hydrogen peroxide generation.








Abstract
Mechanical expansion and contraction of pores within photosynthetic organisms regulate a series of processes that are necessary to manage light absorption, control gas exchange, and regulate water loss. These pores, known as stoma, allow the plant to maximize photosynthetic output depending on environmental conditions such as light intensity, humidity, and temperature by actively changing the size of the stomal opening. Despite advances in artificial photosynthetic systems, little is known about the effect of such mechanical actuation in synthetic materials where chemical reactions occur. It is reported here on a hybrid hydrogel that combines light&#8208;activated supramolecular polymers for superoxide production with thermal mechanical actuation of a covalent polymer. Superoxide production is important in organic synthesis and environmental remediation, and is a potential precursor to hydrogen peroxide liquid fuel. It is shown that the closing of pores in the hybrid hydrogel results in a substantial decrease in photocatalysis, but cycles of swollen and contracted states enhance photocatalysis. The observations motivate the development of biomimetic photosynthetic materials that integrate large scale motion and chemical reactions.

         <title>A Novel Coating&#8208;Extrusion Method Enabled, High Energy, Power Density, and Scalable Production in Monolithically Integrated Energy Storage Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional fiber energy storage device consisting of LMO&#8208;LTP&#8208;AC is developed by the coating&#8208;extrusion method. Due to the continuous preparation process, devices exhibited an ultra&#8208;high production rate of 6000&#160;km&#160;year&#8722;1. This innovative approach significantly enhanced the device performance, achieving a specific capacity of 89.4 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 for fiber batteries and rate performance of 20 C for fiber hybrid supercapacitors.








Abstract
The rise of wearable electronics demands flexible energy storage solutions like flexible fiber energy storage devices (FESDs), known for their flexibility and portability. However, it remains difficult for existing fabrication methods (typically, finite&#8208;coating, thermal&#8208;drawing, and solution&#8208;extrusion) to simultaneously achieve desirable electrochemical performances and fast production of FESDs. Here, a new scalable coating&#8208;extrusion method is developed, utilizing a novel extruded spinneret with tapered apertures to create dual pressure zones. These attributes reduced porosity, enhanced electrode materials loading, and stabilized the interface between the fiber electrode and gel electrolyte of FESDs, enabling the integration of three functional electrodes for the fabrication of both fiber LMO&#8208;LTP batteries and fiber LMO/LTP&#8208;AC hybrid supercapacitor within a single energy storage device. The resultant multifunctional device achieved a high specific capacity of 89.4 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in battery mode and demonstrated excellent rate performance of 20 C with nearly 50% capacity retention in supercapacitor mode, with a production rate of 6000&#160;km&#160;year&#8722;1.

         <title>Negative Enthalpy Doping Stabilizes P2&#8208;Type Oxides Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A negative enthalpy doping strategy can significantly increase its in&#8208;plane stability of the transition metal layer, which considerably suppresses destructive P2 to O2 phase transition and reduces lattice distortion, stabilizing the cycling performance of P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) as cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) largely suffers from continuous accumulation of local stress caused by destructive structural evolution and irreversible oxygen loss upon cycling, leading to rapid capacity degradation. Herein, a strategy of negative enthalpy doping (NED), wherein transition metal (TM) sites are substituted with 0.01&#160;mol each Sn, Sb, Cu, Ti, Mg, and Zn to increase the stability of the TM layers, is proposed. The robust structure of NED&#8208;NNMO significantly suppresses the P2 to O2 phase transition and improves the Na+ kinetics upon long&#8208;term cycling. Consequently, the NED&#8208;NNMO exhibits much smoothened voltage platforms and improved oxygen redox reversibility, thus considerably extended lifetime as compared with the pristine NNMO sample. The NED&#8208;NNMO delivers a high capacity of 138.9 mAh g&#8722;1 with an operation voltage of 3.51&#160;V under 0.1 C and prominent capacity retention of 94.6% after 100 cycles under 1 C, and 90.0% over 3000 cycles under ultra&#8208;high rate of 30 C, which is among the best over previous reports. Moreover, an ampere&#8208;hour scale pouch cell based on the NED&#8208;NNMO demonstrates an energy density of 139&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work sheds light on a route of negative enthalpy doping to design high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Volumetric Methane Storage in Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Porous Polymers via Flexibility Engineering of Building Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented flexible porous polymer HCP&#8208;DPP, constructed by the flexible building unit with the rigid external crosslinker, achieves a desirable trade&#8208;off between porosity and density while displaying an unusual gate&#8208;opening effect; which set a record&#8208;high volumetric methane storage capacity among reported adsorbents, revealing a great promise for flexible hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers in methane storage applications.








Abstract
Adsorbed natural gas (ANG) storage is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional compressed and liquefied storage methods. However, its onboard application is restricted by low volumetric methane storage capacity. Flexible porous adsorbents offer a potential solution, as their dense structures and unique gate&#8208;opening effects are well&#8208;suited to enhance volumetric capacity under high pressures. This study developes a series of hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) with tunable flexibility by modifying the aliphatic chain length in double&#8208;benzene&#8208;ring building blocks, employing a cost&#8208;effective external crosslinking approach. The resulting flexible polymer, HCP&#8208;DPP, exhibits pore expansion under specific methane pressures, producing a high&#8208;pressure adsorption isotherm with gate&#8208;opening behavior. Combined with its intrinsic dense skeleton, this feature leads to superior volumetric methane storage performance over rigid counterparts. Notably, HCP&#8208;DPP achieves a record&#8208;high volumetric total uptake of 333&#160;cm3 STP cm&#8722;3 and a working capacity of 291&#160;cm3 STP cm&#8722;3 at 273 K and 100&#160;bar, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) target of 263&#160;cm3 STP cm&#8722;3. These findings lay a foundation for developing advanced flexible porous adsorbents for practical ANG applications.

         <title>A General Strategy for Exceptionally Robust Conducting Polymer&#8208;Based Bioelectrodes with Multimodal Capabilities Through Decoupled Charge Transport Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an effective strategy to address a longstanding challenge in the practical application of soft bioelectrodes: integrating excellent electrical performance, high compactness, and environmental durability. By leveraging the synergy between holey graphene and conductive polymer, this approach realizes reliable electron&#8208;ion transduction through the construction of robust ionic and electronic transfer pathways at the molecular level.








Abstract
Bioelectrodes function as a critical interface for signal transduction between living organisms and electronics. Conducting polymers (CPs), particularly poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), are among the most promising materials for bioelectrodes, due to their electrical performance, high compactness, and ease of processing, but often suffer from degradation or de&#8208;doping even in some common environments (e.g., electrical stimulation, chemicals, and high temperatures). This instability therefore severely undermines their reliability in practical application. To resolve this critical issue, a novel strategy of separating electron transfer from electron&#8208;ion transduction is proposed. Specifically, chemically derived holey graphene (HG), serving as an ultra&#8208;stable mixed ion&#8208;electron conductor, is introduced into the CP matrix. The HG can restore the CP's destructed conductive pathways, whilst its porosity and its intercalation by the CP synergically preserve fast ionic and molecular diffusion. The resulting bioelectrode therefore exhibits excellent low impedance, high charge injection capacity, electrochemical activity, and outstanding resilience to various harsh conditions, outperforming HG, reduced graphene oxide, CP, or graphene&#8208;coated CP electrodes. Furthermore, this strategy also exhibits broad compatibility with various processing techniques and proves adaptable to other electrode systems, such as stretchable electrodes, paving the way for practical applications in electrophysical capture, neuron modulation, and biochemical analysis.

         <title>Phase and Orbital Engineering Effectuating Efficient Adsorption and Catalysis toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Consequently, c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron&#8208;deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h&#8208;Mo2C) to cubic phase (c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron&#8208;rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based cell achieves a low&#8208;capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah&#8208;c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg S&#8722;1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&#8722;1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

         <title>Porous Silicon Nanoneedles Efficiently Deliver Adenine Base Editor to Correct a Recurrent Pathogenic COL7A1 Variant in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base editing using nanoneedles efficiently corrects pathogenic variants in the type VII collagen gene of primary fibroblasts from patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Nanoneedle editing induces minimal and reversible transcriptional perturbations while restoring the production and secretion of functional type VII collagen. The study highlights the value of nanoneedles as a tool for base editing in cell therapies for genetic disorders.








Abstract
Base editing, a CRISPR&#8208;based genome editing technology, enables precise correction of single&#8208;nucleotide variants, promising resolutive treatment for monogenic genetic disorders like recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). However, the application of base editors in cell manufacturing is hindered by inconsistent efficiency and high costs, contributed by suboptimal delivery methods. Nanoneedles have emerged as an effective delivery approach, enabling highly efficient, non&#8208;perturbing gene therapies both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that nanoneedle delivery of an adenine base editor corrects a heterozygous single&#8208;nucleotide pathogenic variant in COL7A1 in primary RDEB fibroblasts in vitro with 96.5% efficiency, without inducing off&#8208;target variants. The nanoneedle delivery maintains cell viability and displays modest phenotypical alterations unlike conventional cationic lipid transfection. The nanoneedle&#8208;mediated editing significantly increases the production and secretion of full&#8208;length type VII collagen protein, contributing to restore functional fibroblasts phenotype by improving cell adhesion. These findings underscore the suitability and safety of nanoneedles for gene editing in a clinically relevant context of cell manufacturing, establishing a foundation for their use in cell therapies.

&lt;p&gt;Base editing using nanoneedles efficiently corrects pathogenic variants in the type VII collagen gene of primary fibroblasts from patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Nanoneedle editing induces minimal and reversible transcriptional perturbations while restoring the production and secretion of functional type VII collagen. The study highlights the value of nanoneedles as a tool for base editing in cell therapies for genetic disorders.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base editing, a CRISPR-based genome editing technology, enables precise correction of single-nucleotide variants, promising resolutive treatment for monogenic genetic disorders like recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). However, the application of base editors in cell manufacturing is hindered by inconsistent efficiency and high costs, contributed by suboptimal delivery methods. Nanoneedles have emerged as an effective delivery approach, enabling highly efficient, non-perturbing gene therapies both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that nanoneedle delivery of an adenine base editor corrects a heterozygous single-nucleotide pathogenic variant in &lt;i&gt;COL7A1&lt;/i&gt; in primary RDEB fibroblasts in vitro with 96.5% efficiency, without inducing off-target variants. The nanoneedle delivery maintains cell viability and displays modest phenotypical alterations unlike conventional cationic lipid transfection. The nanoneedle-mediated editing significantly increases the production and secretion of full-length type VII collagen protein, contributing to restore functional fibroblasts phenotype by improving cell adhesion. These findings underscore the suitability and safety of nanoneedles for gene editing in a clinically relevant context of cell manufacturing, establishing a foundation for their use in cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Bonding for In&#8208;Situ Welding of Multilayer Elastomers Enables High&#8208;Performance Wearable Electronics for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home&#8208;based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long&#8208;term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning&#8208;assisted system using t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home&#8208;based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.

         <title>Sustainable 4D Printed Meta Biocomposite Materials for Programmable Structural Shape Changing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the architecture of a plant fiber cell wall is simplified to design novel concepts of 4D printed tubular moisture&#8208;driven structural actuators, using the hygromorphic properties of continuous flax fiber (cFF) reinforced materials named meta biocomposites. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device.








Abstract
Biological structures provide inspiration for developing advanced materials from sustainable resources, enabling passive structural morphing. Despite an increasing interest for parsimony&#8208;oriented innovation, sustainable shape&#8208;changing materials based on renewable resources remain underexplored. In this work, the architecture of a single plant fiber cell wall (S2, for instance) is simplified to design novel concepts of 4D printed tubular moisture&#8208;driven structural actuators, using the hygromorphic properties of continuous flax fiber (cFF) reinforced materials. This new class of bioinspired active materials is referred to as metabiocomposites. Before bioinspired design, the materials are produced with a customized rotary 3D printer, qualified, and tested for sorption behavior. A parametric experimental, analytical, and FEA analysis highlights the programmability of the material through the effects of mesostructural parameters (printing inclination &#945;) and geometric factors (operational length L, inner diameter D, and thickness h) on the actuation authority. The overall performance is a trade&#8208;off between rotation and torque, with energy density comparable to that of the source of inspiration: natural fibers cell wall. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device, such as a solar tracker.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Impregnated Robust Interlocking Nano Connector (HiRINC) for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;Migration of Esophageal Stent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of hydrogel&#8208;impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) aims to address stent migration by improving tissue adhesion and reducing mechanical mismatch in self&#8208;expandable metallic stents (SEMSs). The network&#8208;like porous layer of HiRINC enhances adhesion and energy dissipation, demonstrates through ex vivo and in vivo tests, effectively preventing migration in esophageal models.








Abstract
Migration of implanted self&#8208;expandable metallic stent (SEMS) in the malignant or benign esophageal stricture is a common complication but not yet resolved. Herein, this research develops a hydrogel&#8208;impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) to ensure adhesion and reduce the mechanical mismatch between SEMSs and esophageal tissues. Featuring a network&#8208;like porous layer, HiRINC significantly enhances adhesion and energy dissipation during esophageal peristalsis by utilizing mechanical interlocking and increasing hydrogen bonding sites, thereby securing SEMS to tissues. The anti&#8208;swelling property of HiRINC prevents excessive hydrogel expansion, avoiding esophageal blockage. Ex vivo and in vivo adhesion tests confirm that the HiRINC outperforms flat surfaces without RINC structures and effectively prevents stent migration. HiRINC&#8208;coated SEMS maintains its position and luminal patency, minimizing stent&#8208;induced tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory responses in rat and porcine esophageal models during the 4&#8208;week follow&#8208;up. This novel HiRINC&#8208;SEMS can ensure anti&#8208;migration and prolonged stent patency in the rat and porcine esophagus and seems to be expanded to other nonvascular luminal organs and various implantable metallic devices.

         <title>Amorphous High&#8208;entropy Phosphide Nanosheets With Multi&#8208;atom Catalytic Sites for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable electrodeposition combined phosphorization method is reported to synthesize a high&#8208;entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. The Fe and Co/Ni sites in FeCoNiCuYP preferentially stabilize HO* and HOO* intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), disrupting the traditional scaling relation of Gibbs free energy for these intermediates. The FeCoNiCuYP/C demonstrates excellent OER performance, requiring low overpotentials of 316 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mainly encompasses four elementary reactions, involving intermediates such as HO*, O*, and HOO*. Balancing the Gibbs free energies of these intermediates at a single active site is a challenging task. In this work, a high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Y metal elements is synthesized using an electrodeposition method, which then serves as a template for preparing a high&#8208;entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine&#8208;tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm&#8722;2 current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting&#8208;edge electrocatalytic applications.

Catalyzing Sulfur Conversion Reactions
The sluggish sulfur conversion reaction is a bottleneck for the improvement of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery performance. In article number 2413653, Feng Li, Zhenhua Sun, Tong Yu, and co&#8208;workers reveal that long&#8208;range interactions in high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom catalysts regulate the electron states, facilitating sulfur conversion. The cover illustrates that different metal atoms accelerate electron transport, thereby boosting high&#8208;rate performance.

Mn&#8208;Based 2D Magnetoplumbites
In article number 2417906, Xin Gui and co&#8208;workers report the first Mn&#8208;based M&#8208;type hexaferrites, also known as magnetoplumbites. Mn3+ cations construct frustrated triangular, Kagome, and puckered honeycomb sublattices. Magnetic and heat capacity do not exhibit long&#8208;range magnetic order. Two&#8208;dimensional magnetic correlations and frustration within the Mn3+ Kagome layers are confirmed via the reverse Monte Carlo refinements on neutron powder diffraction patterns.

         <title>From Printed Devices to Vertically Stacked, 3D Flexible Hybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed electronics, with their extensive versatility, resource efficiency, and fast&#8208;prototyping capabilities, offer an attractive alternative to Si&#8208;based CMOS technology. This paper reviews the recent advances in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies that could lead to high performance, as well as attributes such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and vertical stack leading to 3D integration.








Abstract
The pursuit of miniaturized Si electronics has revolutionized computing and communication. During recent years, the value addition in electronics has also been achieved through printing, flexible and stretchable electronics form factors, and integration over areas larger than wafer size. Unlike Si semiconductor manufacturing which takes months from tape&#8208;out to wafer production, printed electronics offers greater flexibility and fast&#8208;prototyping capabilities with lesser resources and waste generation. While significant advances have been made with various types of printed sensors and other passive devices, printed circuits still lag behind Si&#8208;based electronics in terms of performance, integration density, and functionality. In this regard, recent advances using high&#8208;resolution printing coupled with the use of high mobility materials and device engineering, for both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane integration, raise hopes. This paper focuses on the progress in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies and related aspects such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and the novel functionalities enabled by vertical integration of printed electronics. By highlighting these advances, this paper intends to reveal the future promise of printed electronics as a sustainable and resource&#8208;efficient route for realizing high&#8208;performance integrated circuits and systems.

         <title>Ultrafast Infrared Plasmonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of ultrafast infrared plasmonics covering the fundamental principles, material systems, manipulation methods, detection techniques, and promising applications. Furthermore, it highlights the future potential of ultrafast infrared plasmonics as a novel platform for exploring ultrafast electronic correlation effects and many&#8208;body interactions.








Abstract
Ultrafast plasmonics represents a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in light&#8208;matter interactions, providing a unique platform to study electronic interactions and collective motions across femtosecond to picosecond timescales. In the infrared regime, where energy aligns with the rearrangements of low&#8208;energy electrons, molecular vibrations, and thermal fluctuations, ultrafast plasmonics can be a powerful tool for revealing ultrafast electronic phase transitions, controlling molecular reactions, and driving subwavelength thermal processes. Here, the evolution of ultrafast infrared plasmonics, discussing the recent progress in their manipulation, detection, and applications is reviewed. The future opportunities, including their potential to probe electronic correlations, investigate intrinsic ultrafast plasmonic interactions, and enable advanced applications in quantum information are highlighted, which may be promoted by multi&#8208;physical field integrated ultrafast techniques.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Tumor Strategies Targeting Nutritional Deprivation: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the abnormal nutrient requirements of tumor cells and tumor tissues, this study focuses on the nutrient and metabolic characteristics of tumor cells and other cell members of the tumor microenvironment and summarizes relevant nutrient deprivation strategies based on targeted technologies, which is of great significance for the development of new nutrition&#8208;targeted anti&#8208;cancer therapies.








Abstract
Higher and richer nutrient requirements are typical features that distinguish tumor cells from AU: cells, ensuring adequate substrates and energy sources for tumor cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, nutrient deprivation strategies based on targeted technologies can induce impaired cell viability in tumor cells, which are more sensitive than normal cells. In this review, nutrients that are required by tumor cells and related metabolic pathways are introduced, and anti&#8208;tumor strategies developed to target nutrient deprivation are described. In addition to tumor cells, the nutritional and metabolic characteristics of other cells in the tumor microenvironment (including macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, T cells, and cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts) and related new anti&#8208;tumor strategies are also summarized. In conclusion, recent advances in anti&#8208;tumor strategies targeting nutrient blockade are reviewed, and the challenges and prospects of these anti&#8208;tumor strategies are discussed, which are of theoretical significance for optimizing the clinical application of tumor nutrition deprivation strategies.

         <title>2D Molecular Crystals for Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices: Status and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of the structures of 2D molecular crystals (2D MCs) and strategies to modify their morphology and properties. Next, it summarizes preparation methods for large&#8208;scale 2D MCs by solution&#8208;based processes or vapor deposition. Finally, it highlights the applications of 2D MCs in electronic and optoelectronic devices with the advantages of tunable properties and scalable preparation methods.








Abstract
2D molecular crystals (2D MCs) are an emerging family of 2D materials formed by organic or inorganic molecules held together entirely by weak intermolecular forces. 2D MCs are gaining attention in electronics and optoelectronics due to their structural diversity, scalability, and strong light&#8211;matter interactions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of 2D MCs and their potential in electronic and optoelectronic applications. It begins by highlighting the structural features and properties of key 2D MCs discovered to date, focusing on three strategies to manipulate intermolecular forces for better control over crystal morphology and properties. Then various methods are explored for fabricating large&#8208;area, highly&#8208;oriented 2D MCs, with an emphasis on vapor&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase techniques. Last, their applications are reviewed in electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as channel materials, photosensitive components, and dielectrics. It is concluded by discussing future challenges and opportunities in the field, offering insights into scalable production and industrial applications of 2D MCs.

         <title>Transforming Adsorbate Surface Dynamics in Aqueous Electrocatalysis: Pathways to Unconstrained Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in operando characterizations and computational simulations have unveiled the unconventional and dynamic nature of surface&#8208;bound reaction intermediates in aqueous electrochemical systems. By tailoring electronic properties and atomic structures of catalytic surfaces, researchers can manipulate adsorbate dynamics to enable energetically favorable reaction pathways, overcoming the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints inherent in conventional reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalysts to accelerate sluggish electrode reactions is critical for the deployment of sustainable aqueous electrochemical technologies, yet remains a great challenge. Rationally integrating functional components to tailor surface adsorption behaviors and adsorbate dynamics would divert reaction pathways and alleviate energy barriers, eliminating conventional thermodynamic constraints and ultimately optimizing energy flow within electrochemical systems. This approach has, therefore, garnered significant interest, presenting substantial potential for developing highly efficient catalysts that simultaneously enhance activity, selectivity, and stability. The immense promise and rapid evolution of this design strategy, however, do not overshadow the substantial challenges and ambiguities that persist, impeding the realization of significant breakthroughs in electrocatalyst development. This review explores the latest insights into the principles guiding the design of catalytic surfaces that enable favorable adsorbate dynamics within the contexts of hydrogen and oxygen electrochemistry. Innovative approaches for tailoring adsorbate&#8208;surface interactions are discussed, delving into underlying principles that govern these dynamics. Additionally, perspectives on the prevailing challenges are presented and future research directions are proposed. By evaluating the core principles and identifying critical research gaps, this review seeks to inspire rational electrocatalyst design, the discovery of novel reaction mechanisms and concepts, and ultimately, advance the large&#8208;scale implementation of electroconversion technologies.

         <title>Proton Storage Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Inorganic Batteries with Moderate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed, and the four proton storage reaction patterns, the proton storage, and transport processes are well refined. The characterization techniques of proton storage are carefully introduced. Especially, the four structural engineering of proton storage modulation are highlighted.








Abstract
The proton (H+) has been proved to be another important energy storage ion besides Zn2+ in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes. H+ storage usually possesses better thermodynamics and reaction kinetics than Zn2+, and is found to be an important addition for Zn2+ storage. Thus, understanding, characterizing, and modulating H+ storage in inorganic cathode materials is particularly important. In this review, recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed. First, the four proton storage reaction patterns of H+ insertion, H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion, H+&#8208;dependent conversion, and H+&#8208;dependent dissolution/deposition reaction are explicitly presented. Meanwhile, the proton storage processes of multi&#8208;sites and multi&#8208;steps, and the Hopping and Grotthuss proton transport mechanisms are carefully introduced. Second, the characterization techniques of proton storage are systematically classified into four types of electrochemical characterization techniques of batteries, structural characterization techniques of inorganic cathodes, pH characterization technique of electrolyte, and quantitative analysis technologies of H+ storage contribution. Third, the structural engineering of proton storage modulation is preliminarily refined to be interlayer engineering, doping engineering, defect engineering, composite engineering, and other engineering. Finally, the emerging challenges and perspectives about future directions of proton storage chemistry are proposed.

         <title>A Biomimetic Sweeping Microrobot for Active Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by sweeping robots, a Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmer capable of cleaning off deleterious disease triggers is designed for the active therapy of ulcerative colitis. The self&#8208;driven ability endows the microswimmer with augmented contact probability with surrounding disease triggers, which contributes to enhanced disease triggers removal efficiency, promising to achieve precise control of the inflammatory storms of ulcerative colitis.








Abstract
Overproduction of pathogenic cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays crucial roles in the onset and perpetuation of ulcerative colitis (UC). Inspired by sweeping robots, a magnesium@polylactic acid&#8208;glycolic acid copolymer@polyethylenimine (Mg@PLGA@PEI) microswimmer capable of cleaning off deleterious disease triggers along its path of progress is designed. Mg@PLGA@PEI is successfully synthesized by adopting a core&#8208;shell structure with a small opening which allows for Mg&#8208;water reaction. The distinctive motility performance resulting from sustained detachment of the produced hydrogen not only contributes to strengthened hydrogen diffusion concomitant with potentiated ROS neutralization, but also facilitates the contacting probability with microenvironmental cfDNA and thus enhances the DNA binding efficiency. By integrating these merits, the developed Mg@PLGA@PEI confers desirable curative efficacy in a classical DSS&#8208;induced acute colitis mouse model. Enema administration of Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmers substantially alleviates the manifestations related to UC, as evidenced by the body weight recovery, colon length retention, colon tissue protection, and attenuated intestinal inflammation, which is attributed to the active scavenging of cfDNA and ROS. This work provides a paradigm for a drug&#8208;free strategy competent in spontaneously eliminating causative triggers with minimal side effects, which presents a promising alternative for the active therapy of UC or other cfDNA&#8208; and ROS&#8208;related diseases in the clinic.

Enema administration of Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmers substantially alleviates the manifestations related to UC, as evidenced by the body weight recovery, colon length retention, colon tissue protection, and attenuated intestinal inflammation, which is attributed to the active scavenging of cfDNA and ROS. This work provides a paradigm for a drug-free strategy competent in spontaneously eliminating causative triggers with minimal side effects, which presents a promising alternative for the active therapy of UC or other cfDNA- and ROS-related diseases in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tissue Mimetic Membranes for Healing Augmentation of Tendon&#8211;Bone Interface in Rotator Cuff Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a tissue&#8208;mimetic membrane for functional tendon&#8211;bone interface regeneration is fabricated. During the implantation, a biomimicry and inductive microenvironment is created by the region&#8208;specific configuration and spatiotemporal release of chondroinductive kartogenin&#8208;conjugated nanogel (nGel&#8208;KGN) and osteoinductive struvite. The In Vitro and in vivo findings validate the prominent regenerative efficacy in rotator cuff repair.








Abstract
The globally prevalent rotator cuff tear has a high re&#8208;rupture rate, attributing to the failure to reproduce the interfacial fibrocartilaginous enthesis. Herein, a hierarchically organized membrane is developed that mimics the heterogeneous anatomy and properties of the natural enthesis and finely facilitates the reconstruction of tendon&#8211;bone interface. A biphasic membrane consisting of a microporous layer and a mineralized fibrous layer is constructed through the non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) strategy followed by a co&#8208;axial electrospinning procedure. Cationic kartogenin (KGN)&#8208;conjugated nanogel (nGel&#8208;KGN) and osteo&#8208;promotive struvite are incorporated within the membranes in a region&#8208;specific manner. During in vivo repair, the nGel&#8208;KGN&#8208;functionalized microporous layer is adjacent to the tendon which intends to suppress scar tissue formation at the lesion and simultaneously heightens chondrogenesis. Meanwhile, the struvite&#8208;containing fibrous layer covers the tubercula minus to enhance stem cell aggregation and bony ingrowth. Such tissue&#8208;specific features and spatiotemporal release behaviors contribute to effective guidance of specific defect&#8208;healing events at the transitional region, further leading to the remarkably promoted regenerative outcome in terms of the fibrocartilaginous tissue formation, collagen fiber alignment, and optimized functional motion of rotator cuff. These findings render a novel biomimetic membrane as a promising material for clinical rotator cuff repair.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale High&#8208;Entropy Design for Superior Capacitive Energy Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for advanced high&#8208;power capacitors. Atomic&#8208;scale investigations determine that introduction of specific elements (Mg, La, Ca, and Sr) can enhance ferroelectric relaxation behavior by different magnitudes. Disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall polar nanoscale regions are detected in the high&#8208;entropy ceramics after introducing trace amounts of Mg and La. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and efficiency of 90% are achieved in a designed high&#8208;entropy ceramic.








Abstract
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for the development of advanced high&#8208;power capacitors. However, achieving ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density and efficiency remains challenging, limiting the progress of leading&#8208;edge energy storage applications. In this study, (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3 (BNT) is selected as the matrix, and the effects of different A&#8208;site elements on domain morphology, lattice polarization, and dielectric and ferroelectric properties are systematically investigated. Mg, La, Ca, and Sr are shown to enhance relaxation behavior by different magnitudes; hence, a high&#8208;entropy strategy for designing local polymorphic distortions is proposed. Based on atomic&#8208;scale investigations, a series of BNT&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy compositions are designed by introducing trace amounts of Mg and La to improve the electric breakdown strength and further disrupt the polar nanoscale regions (PNRs). A disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall PNRs with a minimum size of &#8776;1 nm are detected in the high&#8208;entropy ceramics. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency of 90% are achieved for (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2Mg0.05La0.05Bi0.15Na0.15)TiO3. Furthermore, it displays a high&#8208;power density of 584 MW&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an ultrashort discharge time of 27 ns. This work presents an effective approach for designing dielectric energy storage materials with superior comprehensive performance via a high&#8208;entropy strategy.

         <title>Xolography for Biomedical Applications: Dual&#8208;Color Light&#8208;Sheet Printing of Hydrogels With Local Control Over Shape and Stiffness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paving the way towards 3D&#160;light&#8208;based (bio)printing with spatiotemporal control over structural and mechanical properties&#8212;Xolography of hydrogel&#8208;based photoresins enables the fabrication of high&#8208;resolution constructs with locally modulated stiffness and programmable shape changes.








Abstract
Current challenges in tissue engineering include creation of extracellular environments that support and interact with cells using biochemical, mechanical, and structural cues. Spatial control over these cues is currently limited due to a lack of suitable fabrication techniques. This study introduces Xolography, an emerging dual&#8208;color light&#8208;sheet volumetric printing technology, to achieve control over structural and mechanical features for hydrogel&#8208;based photoresins at micro&#8208; to macroscale while printing within minutes. A water&#8208;soluble photoswitch photoinitiator system and a library of naturally&#8208;derived, synthetic, and thermoresponsive hydrogels for Xolography are proposed. Centimeter&#8208;scale, 3D constructs with positive features of 20&#160;&#181;m and negative features of &#8776;100&#160;&#181;m are fabricated with control over mechanical properties (compressive moduli 0.2&#160;kPa&#8211;6.5&#160;MPa). Notably, switching from binary to grayscaled light projection enables spatial control over stiffness (0.2&#8211;16&#160;kPa). As a proof of concept, grayscaled Xolography is leveraged with thermoresponsive hydrogels to introduce reversible anisotropic shape changes beyond isometric shrinkage. Xolography of viable cell aggregates is finally demonstrated, laying the foundation for cell&#8208;laden printing of dynamic, cell&#8208;instructive environments with tunable structural and mechanical cues in a fast one&#8208;step process. Overall, these innovations unlock unique possibilities of Xolography across multiple biomedical applications.

         <title>Regio&#8208;Selective Mechanical Enhancement of Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticle Composites via Light&#8208;Mediated Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;mediated crosslinkers are incorporated into a polymer&#8208;grafted nanoparticle composite system. This method enables &gt;15&#8208;fold enhancement of tensile modulus upon crosslinking and can be applied to a wide range of monomer compositions. Furthermore, the regio&#8208;selective nature of photocrosslinking allows for the fabrication of compositionally continuous composites with intentionally designed anisotropic mechanical responses, demonstrated via the fabrication of a stiffness&#8208;patterned soft electronic substrate.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;brush&#8208;grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs) that can be covalently crosslinked post&#8208;processing enable the fabrication of mechanically robust and chemically stable polymer nanocomposites with high inorganic filler content. Modifying PGNP brushes to append UV&#8208;activated crosslinkers along the polymer chains would permit a modular crosslinking strategy applicable to a diverse range of nanocomposite compositions. Further, light&#8208;activated crosslinking reactions enable spatial control of crosslink density to program intentionally inhomogeneous mechanical responses. Here, a method of synthesizing composites using UV&#8208;crosslinkable brush&#8208;coated nanoparticles (referred to as UV&#8208;XNPs) is introduced that can be applied to various monomer compositions by incorporating photoinitiators into the polymer brushes. UV crosslinking of processed UV&#8208;XNP structures can increase their tensile modulus up to 15&#8208;fold without any noticeable alteration to their appearance or shape. By using photomasks to alter UV intensity across a sample, intentionally designed inhomogeneities in crosslink density result in predetermined anisotropic shape changes under strain. This unique capability of UV&#8208;XNP materials is applied to stiffness&#8208;patterned flexible electronic substrates that prevent the delamination of rigid components under deformation. The potential of UV&#8208;XNPs as functional, soft device components is further demonstrated by wearable devices that can be modified post&#8208;fabrication to customize their performance, permitting the ability to add functionality to existing device architectures.

By using photomasks to alter UV intensity across a sample, intentionally designed inhomogeneities in crosslink density result in predetermined anisotropic shape changes under strain. This unique capability of UV-XNP materials is applied to stiffness-patterned flexible electronic substrates that prevent the delamination of rigid components under deformation. The potential of UV-XNPs as functional, soft device components is further demonstrated by wearable devices that can be modified post-fabrication to customize their performance, permitting the ability to add functionality to existing device architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The 2D Cr5Te6 nanosheets are systematically synthesized with an in situ formed &#8776;2 nm&#8208;thick Te doped Cr2O3 layer (Te&#8208;Cr2O3) on the upper surface by chemical vapor deposition method.

Abstract
The exchange bias (EB) effect is a fundamental magnetic phenomenon, in which the exchange bias field/coercive field ratio (|HEB/HC|) can improve the stability of spintronic devices. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnetic heterostructures have the potential to construct low&#8208;power and high&#8208;density spintronic devices, while their typically air unstable and |HEB/HC| lesser, limiting the possibility of applications. Here, 2D Cr5Te6 nanosheets have been systematically synthesized with an in situ formed &#8776;2 nm&#8208;thick Te doped Cr2O3 layer (Te&#8208;Cr2O3) on the upper surface by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method. The strong and air stable EB effect, achieving a |HEB/HC| of up to 80% under an ultralow cooling field of 0.01 T, which is greater than that of the reported 2D magnetic heterostructures. Meanwhile, the uniformity of thickness and chemical composition of the Te&#8208;Cr2O3 layer can be controlled by the growth conditions which are highly correlated with the EB effect of 2D Te&#8208;Cr2O3/Cr5Te6 heterostructures. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the Te&#8208;Cr2O3 can provide uncompensated spins in the Cr2O3, thus forming strong spin pinning effect. The systematical investigation of the EB effect in 2D Te&#8208;Cr2O3/Cr5Te6 heterostructures with high |HEB/HC| will open up exciting opportunities in low&#8208;power and high&#8208;stability 2D spintronic devices.

         <title>Heterodimeric Photosensitizer as Radical Generators to Promoting Type I Photodynamic Conversion for Hypoxic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In heterodimeric NBSSe, the NBS/NBSe radical pair formation in the co&#8208;excited NBSSe* after intramolecular electron transfer successfully converts type II into type I photodynamic pathway on a traditional type II photosensitizer NBSe of high reactive oxygen species yield. Incorporating electron&#8208;rich BSA further promotes O2&#8208;&#183; generation and photostability of this radical generator via recycling radicals, with an efficient tumor targeting capability for BSA@NBSSe.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using traditional type II photosensitizers (PSs) has been limited in hypoxic tumors due to excessive oxygen consumption. The conversion from type II into a less oxygen&#8208;dependent type I PDT pathway has shown the potential to combat hypoxic tumors. Herein, the design of a heterodimeric PS, NBSSe, by conjugating a widely used type I PS NBS and a type II PS NBSe via molecular dimerization, achieving the aggregation&#8208;regulated efficient type I photodynamic conversion for the first time is reported. Electrochemistry characterizations and theoretical calculations elucidate that NBSSe tends to form a S+&#183;/Se&#8722;&#183; radical pair via intramolecular electron transfer in the co&#8208;excited NBSSe* aggregate, realizing 7.25&#8208;fold O2&#8722;&#183; generation compared to NBS and 80% suppression of 1O2 generation compared to NBSe. The enhanced O2&#8722;&#183; generation of NBSSe enables excellent anti&#8208;hypoxia PDT efficiency and inhibition of pulmonary metastasis. Additionally, the incorporation of electron&#8208;rich bovine serum albumin accelerates the recycling of cationic PS radical NBSSe+&#183;, further boosting photostability and O2&#8722;&#183; generation. The resultant BSA@NBSSe nanoparticles demonstrate successful tumor&#8208;targeting PDT capability. This work provides an appealing avenue to convert ROS generation from the type II pathway to the type I pathway for efficient cancer phototherapy in hypoxia.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Gap&#8208;Rich PdMn Nanofibers with High Mass/Electron Transport Highways for Electrocatalytic Reforming of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique self&#8208;assembled gap&#8208;rich PdMn nanofibers, featuring with high mass/electron transport highways, which is used as an efficient catalyst of polyethylene terephthalate to high&#8208;valued glycolic acid at an industrial current.








Abstract
Innovating nanocatalysts with both high intrinsic catalytic activity and high selectivity is crucial for multi&#8208;electron reactions, however, their low mass/electron transport at industrial&#8208;level currents is often overlooked, which usually leads to low comprehensive performance at the device level. Herein, a Cl&#8722;/O2 etching&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly strategy is reported for synthesizing a self&#8208;assembled gap&#8208;rich PdMn nanofibers with high mass/electron transport highway for greatly enhancing the electrocatalytic reforming of waste plastics at industrial&#8208;level currents. The self&#8208;assembled PdMn nanofiber shows excellent catalytic activity in upcycling waste plastics into glycolic acid, with a high current density of 223 mA cm&#8722;2@0.75 V (vs RHE), high selectivity (95.6%), and Faraday efficiency (94.3%) to glycolic acid in a flow electrolyzer. Density functional theory calculation, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy combined with in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of highly oxophilic Mn induces a downshift of the d&#8208;band center of Pd, which optimizes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates on PdMn surface, thereby facilitating the desorption of glycolic acid as a high&#8208;value product. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirm that the gap&#8208;rich nanofiber structure is conducive for mass transfer to deliver an industrial&#8208;level current.

         <title>PerC B&#8208;Cells Activation via Thermogenetics&#8208;Based CXCL12 Generator for Intraperitoneal Immunity Against Metastatic Disseminated Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isotropic&#8208;porous, cell&#8208;fitting, thermogenetics&#8208;based chemokine CXCL12 generator is described as a B&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent intraperitoneal immunotherapy&#160;that can trigger intraperitoneal anti&#8208;tumor immunity against metastatic disseminated tumor cell to assuage peritoneal effusion and peritoneal metastasis. Unexpectedly, the peritoneal cavity B cell subset is identified as playing a key role in exogenous antigen presentation and presenting a unique transcriptional signature.








Abstract
During cancer peritoneal metastasis (PM), conventional antigen&#8208;presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) promote tumorigenesis and immunosuppression in peritoneal cavity. While intraperitoneal immunotherapy (IPIT) has been used in clinical investigations to relieve PM, the limited knowledge of peritoneal immunocytes has hindered the development of therapeutic IPIT. Here, a dendritic cell&#8208;independent, next&#8208;generation IPIT is described that activates peritoneal cavity B (PerC B) cell subsets for intraperitoneal anti&#8208;tumor immunity via exogenous antigen presentation. The PerC B&#8208;cell&#8208;involved IPIT framework consists of an isotropic&#8208;porous, cell&#8208;fitting, thermogenetics&#8208;based CXCL12 generator. Such nanoscale thermal&#8208;confined generator can programmatically fine&#8208;tune the expression of CXCL12 to recruit disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) through CXCL12&#8208;CXCR4 axis while avoiding cytokine storm, subsequently release DTC&#8208;derived antigen to trigger PerC B&#8208;cell&#8208;involved immunity. Notably, antigen&#8208;presenting B&#8208;cell cluster, expressing the regulatory signaling molecules Ptpn6, Ms4a1, and Cd52, is identified playing the key role in the IPIT via single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing. Moreover, such IPIT availably assuages peritoneal effusion and PM in an orthotopic gastric cancer and metastatic model. Overall, this work offers a perspective on PerC B&#8208;cell&#8208;involved antigen&#8208;presenting in intraperitoneal immunity and&#160;provides a configurable strategy for activating anti&#8208;DTC immunity for next&#8208;generation IPIT.

&lt;p&gt;An isotropic-porous, cell-fitting, thermogenetics-based chemokine CXCL12 generator is described as a B-cell-dependent intraperitoneal immunotherapy&#160;that can trigger intraperitoneal anti-tumor immunity against metastatic disseminated tumor cell to assuage peritoneal effusion and peritoneal metastasis. Unexpectedly, the peritoneal cavity B cell subset is identified as playing a key role in exogenous antigen presentation and presenting a unique transcriptional signature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During cancer peritoneal metastasis (PM), conventional antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) promote tumorigenesis and immunosuppression in peritoneal cavity. While intraperitoneal immunotherapy (IPIT) has been used in clinical investigations to relieve PM, the limited knowledge of peritoneal immunocytes has hindered the development of therapeutic IPIT. Here, a dendritic cell-independent, next-generation IPIT is described that activates peritoneal cavity B (PerC B) cell subsets for intraperitoneal anti-tumor immunity via exogenous antigen presentation. The PerC B-cell-involved IPIT framework consists of an isotropic-porous, cell-fitting, thermogenetics-based CXCL12 generator. Such nanoscale thermal-confined generator can programmatically fine-tune the expression of CXCL12 to recruit disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) through CXCL12-CXCR4 axis while avoiding cytokine storm, subsequently release DTC-derived antigen to trigger PerC B-cell-involved immunity. Notably, antigen-presenting B-cell cluster, expressing the regulatory signaling molecules &lt;i&gt;Ptpn6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ms4a1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Cd52&lt;/i&gt;, is identified playing the key role in the IPIT via single-cell RNA sequencing. Moreover, such IPIT availably assuages peritoneal effusion and PM in an orthotopic gastric cancer and metastatic model. Overall, this work offers a perspective on PerC B-cell-involved antigen-presenting in intraperitoneal immunity and&#160;provides a configurable strategy for activating anti-DTC immunity for next-generation IPIT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanmodulin&#8208;Decorated Microbes for Efficient Lanthanide Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;scaffolded lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli is developed as a simple, effective material for repeated capture and release of rare earth elements (REEs). Over 80% of four REE cations are captured, even in the presence of excess competitive ions. The material can be employed in a filtration flow&#8208;through system with a capture capacity of 11.8 &#177; 0.9 mg g&#8722;1 dry cell weight.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for many clean energy technologies. Yet, they are a limited resource currently obtained through carbon&#8208;intensive mining. Here, bio&#8208;scaffolded proteins serve as simple, effective materials for the recovery of REEs. Surface expression of the protein lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli, followed by freeze&#8208;drying of the microbes, yields a displayed protein material for REE recovery. Four REE cations (Y3+, La3+, Gd3+, and Tb3+) are captured efficiently, with over 80% recovery even in the presence of competitive ions at one&#8208;hundred&#8208;fold excess. Moreover, these materials are readily integrated into a filter with high capture capacity (12 mg g&#8722;1 dry cell weight) for the selective isolation and recovery of REEs from complex matrices. Further, the proteins in the filter remain stable over ten bind&#8208;and&#8208;release cycles and a week of storage. To improve the deployability of this filter material, a simple colorimetric assay with the dye alizarin&#8208;3&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid is incorporated. The assay can be performed in under 5 min, enabling rapid monitoring of REE recovery and filter efficiency. Overall, this low&#8208;cost, robust material will enable environmentally friendly recycling and recovery of critical elements.

         <title>STING&#8208;Activating Polymers Boost Lymphatic Delivery of mRNA Vaccine to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
LNP is modified by a novel STING&#8208;activating polymer (PD) to enhance immune effect of mRNA vaccines by boosting cellular uptake and triggering robust immune activation. Optimizing the polymerization of PD significantly amplifies mRNA translation efficiency and STING&#8208;mediated immune responses, offering a powerful approach to advance mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy.









Abstract
The unprecedented success of mRNA vaccines against COVID&#8208;19 has inspired scientists to develop mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. However, using nucleoside modified mRNA as vaccine, though evading innate immune toxicity, diminishes its therapeutic efficacy for cancers. Here, we report a polyvalent stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activating polymer (termed as PD) to bolster the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine. PD is made of tertiary amine units and conjugated with a biodegradable alkyl chain. Co&#8208;formulation of PDs bearing different number of tertiary amines with lipid materials and mRNA resulted in the lipid&#8208;like nanoparticles (PD LNPs) which effectively promoted lymphatic delivery and elicited robust immune activation via the STING signaling pathway. Notably, PD with eighteen tertiary amines (PD18) is predominant in balancing immune activity and tolerability. Subcutaneous administration of PD18 LNPs containing ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA enhanced the frequency of antigen specific CD8+ T cell with immune memory, leading to potent anticancer efficacy that surpassed 2&#8242;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP in both prophylactic and therapeutic cancer models. Additionally, PD18 LNP&#8208;based mRNA vaccine showed conferred resistance to cancer challenge for up to 60 days. Overall, this study offers a new perspective of using STING&#8208; activating polymer for imparting synergistic activity in mRNA vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Input Molecular Classifier Based on Digital DNA Strand Displacement for Disease Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) is developed for advanced molecular classification of processing multiple inputs. By minimizing oligonucleotide requirements, DDSD enables binary and multiclass molecular classification in a simplified manner. It has been successfully applied in infection diagnostics and pathogen identification using blood samples. Computing capability can be further enhanced by cascade DDSD and multiway junction DDSD.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular computing systems for biomarkers have emerged as powerful tools for intelligent diagnostics. However, with the variety of feature biomarkers expanding, current molecular computing systems suffer from the use of a large number of oligonucleotides and limited encoding capability. Here, the study develops an alternative molecular computing approach termed Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) which recognizes targets and operates target valence through DNA polymerase&#8208;based extension and strand release. DDSD significantly reduced the number of used oligonucleotide species, provided robust molecular classifiers. In clinical blood samples, a 96% accuracy rate is achieved with a DDSD&#8208;based binary classifier for distinguishing bacterial and viral infections, a 100% accuracy rate is achieved with a multiclass classifier for identifying pathogen types, surpassing existing classifier systems. Moreover, DDSD can be readily expanded. Cascade DDSD is developed, enabling simultaneous computing of up to 14 valence states with a maximum valence of 25. Multiway junction DDSD is implemented to achieve high&#8208;valence computing by compact DNA nanostructures rather than split DNA computing units, reducing the potential leakage. The implementation of DDSD enhances the capability of valence&#8208;based intelligent molecular diagnostics and multiplexed biomarker detection.

         <title>Electroactive Dressing with Selective Sorption of Exudate Enables Treatment of Complicated Wound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroactive dressing (cMO/PVA) designed via a facile bilayer composite approach and charging procedure integrates selective sorption, long&#8208;term electrical stimulation therapy, and antibacterial properties simultaneously, showing an appealing application prospect for complicated wound repair.








Abstract
Exudate management and cell activity enhancement are vital to complicated wound healing. However, current exudate management dressings indiscriminately remove exudate, which is detrimental to cell activity enhancement. Herein, a novel class of electroactive bilayer (cMO/PVA) dressing is developed by constructing manganese oxide nanoneedle&#8208;clusters decorated commercial carbon cloth (MO), in situ casting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, and finally charging. Benefitting from the hierarchical nanoneedle&#8208;cluster structure of MO, abundant active sites are sufficiently exposed to achieve high area&#8208;specific capacitances (e.g., 1881.3 mF cm&#8722;2), thereby establishing the long&#8208;lasting electric field for cMO/PVA dressing. Such a unique cMO/PVA dressing can realize extraordinary selective sorption toward noxious substances over nutrient substances during exudate management. Meanwhile, its long&#8208;term electrical stimulation therapy can promote cell proliferation and migration&#160;and enhance antibacterial property. As a result, our multifunctional cMO/PVA dressing can rapidly repair full&#8208;thickness wounds in type II diabetic rats, offering an advanced strategy for the treatment of complicated wounds.

As a result, our multifunctional cMO/PVA dressing can rapidly repair full-thickness wounds in type II diabetic rats, offering an advanced strategy for the treatment of complicated wounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Range Interactions Between High&#8208;Entropy Single&#8208;Atoms in Catalyzing Sulfur Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the mechanism of high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom catalysts (HESAC), this study reveals how long&#8208;range interactions and entropy govern electron states, enhancing electrocatalysis for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with a superior rate capacity of 3.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 10 C.








Abstract
Sulfur conversion reactions are the foundation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries but usually possess sluggish kinetics during practical battery operation. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom&#160;catalyst (HESAC) is synthesized for this process. In contrast to conventional dual&#8208;atom catalysts that form metal&#8211;metal bonds, the center metal atoms in HESAC are not bonded but exhibit long&#8208;range interactions at a sub&#8208;nanometer distance (&lt;9 &#197;). The synergistic effect between the long&#8208;range interactions and entropy changes enables the regulation of d&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron states. This alteration in the electronic structure improves the adsorption and electronic conductivity of intermediate polysulfides, thereby accelerating their conversion kinetics. Consequently, this leads to a significant enhancement in specific capacities by &#8776;40% at high rates compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts. The resulting lithium&#8211;sulfur battery with HESAC demonstrates a remarkable areal capacity of 3.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 10 C. These findings provide valuable insights into the design principle of metal atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Efficient Spin&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With Tunable Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emission at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites are reported with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in films and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in spin&#8208;LEDs in the red to near&#8208;infrared spectrum region. Spectroscopic studies show that the CPL and CPEL originate from an energy and spin funnel process in the chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites.








Abstract
Spin light&#8208;emitting diodes (spin&#8208;LEDs) are important for spin&#8208;based electronic circuits as they convert the carrier spin information to optical polarization. Recently, chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) has emerged as a new paradigm to enable spin&#8208;LED as it does not require any magnetic components and operates at room temperature. However, CISS&#8208;enabled spin&#8208;LED with tunable wavelengths ranging from red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) has yet to be demonstrated. Here, chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites are developed to fabricate efficient spin&#8208;LEDs with tunable wavelengths from red to NIR region by tuning the halide composition. The optimized chiral perovskite films exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence from 675 to 788&#160;nm, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 86% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) ranging from 8.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 2.6 &#215; 10&#8722;2. More importantly, direct circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is achieved at room temperature in spin&#8208;LEDs. This work demonstrated efficient red and NIR spin&#8208;LEDs with the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaching 12.4% and the electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (gEL) ranging from 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 1.48 &#215; 10&#8722;2 at room temperature. The composition&#8208;dependent CPEL performance is further attributed to the prolonged spin lifetime as revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy.

         <title>Nucleation&#8208;Controlled Crystallization of Chiral 2D Perovskite Single Crystal Thin Films for High&#8208;Sensitivity Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleation&#8208;controlled strategy is developed, to grow Dion&#8722;Jacobson phase 2D chiral perovskite single crystal thin films (SCTFs), from water&#8208;air interface, with a novel chiral ligand, (R/S)&#8208;3&#8208;Aminopyrrolidine. The obtained ultrathin SCTFs, with shortened spacing between inorganic layers, exhibit reduced exciton binding energy and enhanced carrier transport. In results, photodetectors based on the SCTFs show superior sensitivity to the circularly polarized light.








Abstract
2D Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) chiral perovskite materials exhibit significant promise for developing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized light (CPL) photodetectors. However, the inherently thick nature of DJ&#8208;phase 2D perovskite single crystal limits their ability to differentiate CPL photons with the two opposite polarization states. In addition, the growth of DJ&#8208;phase perovskite single crystal thin films (SCTFs) has proven challenging due to the strong interlayer electronic coupling. Here, a nucleation&#8208;controlled strategy is employed to grow a novel DJ&#8208;phase perovskite [(R/S)&#8208;3APr]PbI4 [(R/S)&#8208;3APr = (R/S)&#8208;3&#8208;Aminopyrrolidine] SCTFs with large area, low thickness and hence high aspect ratios. Structural and photoluminescence analyses reveal that introducing the divalent organic cations into the perovskite framework reduce the interlayer distance, resulting in low exciton binding energy. This facilitates charge separation and transport. The resulting SCTF photodetector showcases excellent detection performance with anisotropy factor for photocurrent as high as 0.65, responsivity of 1.97 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 5.3 &#215; 1013 Jones, and 3&#8208;dB frequency of 2940&#160;Hz, demonstrating its potential as a promising candidate for CPL&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. This novel approach, therefore, provides a framework for the growth of DJ&#8208;phase perovskite SCTFs and advances their applications in sensitive CPL photodetection.

         <title>Influence of Free Space on Lithium Growth Behavior at Open Surfaces and Internal Cracks of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium growth follows two modes within the crack of argyrodite sulfide solid electrolyte: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side&#8208;wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side&#8208;wall surface toward the free space inside the crack.








Abstract
Lithium dendrite penetration through solid electrolyte has been the major obstacle for practical sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). Herein, a series of tailored model solid cells are designed to investigate the intrinsic lithium growth behavior at open surfaces and internal cracks of sulfide solid electrolyte. It is shown that when plating lithium on the open surface of electrolyte (free space), the lithium exhibits an intrinsic columnar growth behavior perpendicular to the electrolyte surface, preferentially along the (110) crystal&#160;axis. When plating lithium within the internal cracks (confined free space), the growth of lithium follows two major modes: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side&#8208;wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side&#8208;wall surface toward the confined free space inside the crack. The extent of lithium ingress into electrolyte under external pressure in the initial state is found to determine the rate of lithium infiltration after applying the current. As a further validation, intact sintered electrolytes with 99% relative density minimize initial lithium ingress, enabling lithium plating at 6.37&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an areal capacity exceeding 76 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 without short circuit.

         <title>Ligand Inter&#8208;Relation Analysis Via Graph Theory Predicts Macrophage Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph theory modeling of RGD nano inter&#8208;relation inversely proportional to the shortest path distance and proportional to the corresponding number of possible instances is harnessed. RGD nano inter&#8208;relation can be regulated by modulating the aspect ratio of magnetic nanobars, which can be increased by unidirectionally aligning or reversibly lifting magnetic nanobars, thereby promoting integrin&#8208;bearing filopodia penetration and adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of host macrophages.








Abstract
Graph theory has been widely used to quantitatively analyze complex networks of molecules, materials, and cells. Analyzing the dynamic complex structure of extracellular matrix can predict cell&#8208;material interactions but has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, graph theory&#8208;based mathematical modeling of RGD ligand graph inter&#8208;relation is demonstrated by differentially cutting off RGD&#8208;to&#8208;RGD interlinkages with flexibly conjugated magnetic nanobars (MNBs) with tunable aspect ratio. The RGD&#8208;to&#8208;RGD interlinkages are less effectively cut off by MNBs with a lower aspect ratio, which decreases the shortest path while increasing the number of instances thereof, thereby augmenting RGD nano inter&#8208;relation. This facilitates integrin recruitment of macrophages and thus actin fiber assembly and vinculin expression, which mediates pro&#8208;regenerative polarization, involving myosin II, actin polymerization, and rho&#8208;associated protein kinase. Unidirectional pre&#8208;aligning or reversibly lifting highly elongated MNBs both increase RGD nano inter&#8208;relation, which promotes host macrophage adhesion and switches their polarization from pro&#8208;inflammatory to pro&#8208;regenerative phenotype. The latter approach produces nano&#8208;spaces through which macrophages can penetrate and establish RGD links thereunder. Using graph theory, this study presents the example of mathematically modeling the functionality of extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;mimetic materials, which can help elucidate complex dynamics of the interactions occurring between host cells and materials via versatile geometrical nano&#8208;engineering.

         <title>Nanomagnetism Triggering Carriers Double&#8208;Resistance Conduction and Excellent Flexible Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomagnetism&#8208;triggered double&#8208;resistance conduction greatly enhances thermoelectric performance of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/epoxy films with a maximum zT of 1.44 at 320 K, providing insights into magnetism&#8208;enhanced thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Nanomagnetism may enable electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient to be decoupled and can potentially lead to remarkable enhancements in thermoelectric (TE) performance, however, their physical mechanisms have not been explored. Herein, it is shown that the nanomagnetism from Fe and Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/epoxy flexible films can lead to the carriers splitting into spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down conductive branches with different resistances and mobilities due to the exchange interaction between the spin of carriers and the nanomagnetism. The double&#8208;resistance conduction of carriers may well explain the decoupling of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient and their simultaneous enhancements in the thermo&#8208;electro&#8208;magnetic flexible films. It is further shown that the maximum dimensionless figure of merit of the thermo&#8208;electro&#8208;magnetic flexible films reaches between 1.2 and 1.4 at room temperature, and their five&#8208;level cascaded device based on the films achieves a temperature drop of 3.1 K through in&#8208;plane heat dissipation, making a new record for printing flexible TE films and devices. The double&#8208;resistance conduction of carriers also reveals a deep physical mechanism for magneto&#8208;enhanced TE performance of bulk thermoelectrics.

         <title>Oriented Cortical&#8208;Bone&#8208;Like Silk Protein Lamellae Effectively Repair Large Segmental Bone Defects in Pigs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk proteins can be fabricated into large scaffolds with cortical&#8208;bone&#8208;like lamellar structures through freeze&#8208;casting. The resultant freeze&#8208;cast scaffolds are made of parallel silk protein lamellae and can be implanted into pig models to achieve effective bone regeneration without side effects.









Abstract
Assembling natural proteins into large, strong, bone&#8208;mimetic scaffolds for repairing bone defects in large&#8208;animal load&#8208;bearing sites remain elusive. Here this challenge is tackled by assembling pure silk fibroin (SF) into 3D scaffolds with cortical&#8208;bone&#8208;like lamellae, superior strength, and biodegradability through freeze&#8208;casting. The unique lamellae promote the attachment, migration, and proliferation of tissue&#8208;regenerative cells (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] and human umbilical vein endothelial cells) around them, and are capable of developing in vitro into cortical&#8208;bone organoids with a high number of MSC&#8208;derived osteoblasts. High&#8208;SF&#8208;content lamellar scaffolds, regardless of MSC inoculation, regenerated more bone than non&#8208;lamellar or low&#8208;SF&#8208;content lamellar scaffolds. They accelerated neovascularization by transforming macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, promoting bone regeneration to repair large segmental bone defects (LSBD) in minipigs within three months, even without growth factor supplements. The bone regeneration can be further enhanced by controlling the orientation of the lamella to be parallel to the long axis of bone during implantation. This work demonstrates the power of oriented lamellar bone&#8208;like protein scaffolds in repairing LSBD in large animal models.

         <title>Advancing Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Semiconductors with Organic Radical Charge Transfer Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors are constructed in organic radical cocrystals by a simple solution&#8208;process method. It is suggested that the primary sources of the boosting in magnetic and electrical properties are the enhancement of charge&#8208;transfer interactions induced by radicals.








Abstract
Developing purely organic room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors has been a long&#8208;sought goal in the material community toward the simultaneous control of spin and charge. Organic cocrystals, known for their structural versatility and multifunctionality, are ideal candidates for these magnetoelectric coupling applications. However, organic room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductor cocrystals have rarely been reported, and their mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the complexity of cocrystal structures. Here, doping organic cocrystals with radicals offers a promising strategy for boosting their magnetism and conductivity while maintaining their cocrystal structures. The fluoranthene&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane radical (FA&#8208;HTCNQ&#8226;) is constructed through a simple, rapid, and eco&#8208;friendly solution&#8208;processing approach. The conductive FA&#8208;HTCNQ&#8226; exhibits excellent room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism with the coercive fields of 96 Oe and the Curie temperature near 400 K, superior to its structural&#8208;identical undoped counterpart. Meanwhile, the room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is demonstrated in the conductive FA&#8208;HTCNQ&#8226;. The stronger ferromagnetism and conductivity in organic cocrystals are attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions induced by radicals, rather than the spin exchange interactions between these radicals alone. The research manifests the origin of ferromagnetism in organic cocrystals and provides a simple strategy to fabricate pure organic room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductor materials for future integrated magnetoelectric devices.

         <title>Improving the Scintillation Performance of PEA2PbBr4 Through Zn2+ and Sb3+ Interstitial Doping Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>

PEA2PbBr4 is a promising scintillator for &#947;&#8208;rays and nf detection. However, its energy resolution in &#947;&#8208;rays detection is poor and the ability to discriminate nf/&#947;&#8208;rays has not been accurately reported. It is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping enhances light yield and optimizes luminescence. Improved scintillator achieves 4.84% and 5.65% energy resolution at 662 keV and effective discrimination in &#947;&#8208;rays/nf detection.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic halide 2D perovskite single crystals have recently emerged as promising scintillators for gamma (&#947;) rays and fast neutrons (nf) detection. However, their energy resolution in &#947;&#8208;rays detection still significantly lags behind that of perovskite semiconductor detectors. Improving crystal defects and enhancing light yield to optimize light output detected by the photomultiplier tube are crucial strategies for addressing this issue. Herein, it is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ cation interstitial doping strategy can effectively reduce internal defects within the phenylethylammonium lead bromide (PEA2PbBr4) crystal by regulating lattice expansion. This approach also suppresses light loss caused by exciton&#8208;exciton annihilation and accelerates electron&#8208;hole recombination processes, optimizing both the luminescence intensity and decay lifetime of the scintillator. The Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping PEA2PbBr4 scintillator achieve an optimal energy resolution of 4.84% and 5.65% at 662&#160;keV for the photopeak, respectively. Additionally, in the 241Am&#8208;Be field, effective identification of nf and &#947;&#8208;rays around 1100 keVee is achieved using a pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method, with the figure of merit (FOM) being 0.85 and 1.03, respectively. This work provides a reliable new approach for optimizing the scintillation performance of 2D perovskite and promotes the application of 2D perovskite scintillator in &#947;&#8208;rays and nf detection.

         <title>Giant Modulation of Magnetoresistance in a Van Der Waals Magnet by In&#8208;Plane Current Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the transition of magnetic interlayer coupling in a van der Waals (vdW) magnet driven by an in&#8208;plane electrical bias, leading to a significant modulation of magnetoresistance. This finding introduces a novel approach to controlling magnetization through electrical bias for spintronic applications with vdW magnets.









Abstract
Efficient magnetization control is a central issue in magnetism and spintronics. Particularly, there are increasing demands for manipulation of magnetic states in van der Waals (vdW) magnets with unconventional functionalities. However, the electrically induced phase transition between ferromagnetic&#8208;to&#8208;antiferromagnetic states without external magnetic field is yet to be demonstrated. Here, the current&#8208;induced magnetic phase transition in a vdW ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 is reported. Based on magneto&#8208;transport measurements and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that transition in the interlayer magnetic coupling occurs through vertical voltage drop between layers induced by current which is attributed to high anisotropy of the resistivity caused by the vdW gaps. Such magnetic phase transition results in giant modulation of the longitudinal magnetoresistance from 5% to 170%. The electrical tunability of the magnetic phase in Fe5GeTe2 with current&#8208;in&#8208;plane geometry opens a path for electric control of magnetic properties, expanding the ability to use vdW magnets for spintronic applications.

         <title>Building a Highly Stable Red/Near Infrared Afterglow Library with Highly Branched Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach is presented for achieving a stable red/NIR afterglow with high brightness and durability at high temperatures from branched luminogens. The advantages and universality of branched luminogen@red/near&#8208;infrared dye systems are demonstrated by varying the topological structures of the lumonigens using different numbers of branches (two to eight branches) and cores and employing dyes of different sizes.








Abstract
Achieving organic red/near infrared (NIR) phosphorescence at high temperatures is theoretically challenging because of the severe nonradiative transitions of excited triplet states with low energy gaps. This study realizes bright and persistent red/NIR afterglow with excellent high&#8208;temperature resistance up to 413 K via highly efficient (&#8776;100%) phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) from rationally designed branched phosphorescence luminogens as energy donors to red/NIR dyes as acceptors, coupled with optimized aggregated structures. According to systematic investigations, the abundant internal cavities formed by the highly branched luminogens in solid states ensure dye loading and space limitation, which can considerably suppress nonradiative transitions at high temperatures, promoting a persistent red/NIR afterglow with excellent stability. Moreover, 16 types of host&#8211;guest systems with varied topological structures of branched luminogens and different red/NIR dyes of various sizes confirm the universality of the strategy. This study provides an efficient approach to achieve a highly stable red/NIR afterglow.

         <title>Elucidating Thermal Decomposition Kinetic Mechanism of Charged Layered Oxide Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are rapidly advancing to confront energy and environmental challenges, but the safety of SIBs has not received enough attention. The kinetic triplet model is constructed based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations to unveil a thermal decomposition kinetic mechanism of the P2&#8208;type layered transition metal oxides before and after doping.








Abstract
The safety of the P2&#8208;type layered transition metal oxides (P2&#8208;NaxTMO2), a promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), is a prerequisite for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, previous thermal runaway studies mainly focused on morphological changes resulting from gas production detection and thermogravimetric analysis, while the structural transition and chemical reactions underlying these processes are still unclear. Herein, a comprehensive methodology to unveil an interplay mechanism among phase structures, interfacial microcrack, and thermal stability of the charged P2&#8208;Na0.8Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) and the P2&#8208;Na0.8Ni0.21Li0.12Mn0.67O2 (NNMO&#8208;Li) at elevated temperatures is established. Combining a series of crystallographic and thermodynamic characterization techniques, the specific chemical reactions occurring in the NNMO materials during thermal runaway are clarified first&#160;and solidly proved that Li doping effectively hinders the dissolution of transition metal ions, reduces oxygen release, and enhances thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Importantly, based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations, the kinetic triplet model is successfully constructed to in&#8208;depth elucidate the thermal decomposition reaction mechanism of P2&#8208;NaxTMO2, demonstrating that such thermodynamic assessment provides a new perspective for building high&#8208;safety SIBs.

         <title>Close&#8208;to&#8208;Equilibrium Crystallization for Large&#8208;Scale and High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A close&#8208;to&#8208;equilibrium crystallization method that enables the growth of large, high&#8208;quality single crystals is proposed. This approach uses independent units for solute supply, crystal growth, and solute recycling, ensuring the system operates at an optimized, steady&#8208;state growth point within the solubility phase diagram, maintaining consistent crystal growth even with varying perovskite growth window widths.









Abstract
The growth of large semiconductor crystals is crucial for advancing modern electronics and optoelectronics. While various crystal growth techniques have been developed for lead halide perovskites, a significant challenge remains: as crystal size increases, performance tends to deteriorate dramatically. This study addresses the inherent limitations of perovskite crystal growth by designing a novel strategy for near&#8208;equilibrium growth system to maintain optimal conditions throughout the process.

&lt;p&gt;A close-to-equilibrium crystallization method that enables the growth of large, high-quality single crystals is proposed. This approach uses independent units for solute supply, crystal growth, and solute recycling, ensuring the system operates at an optimized, steady-state growth point within the solubility phase diagram, maintaining consistent crystal growth even with varying perovskite growth window widths.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of large semiconductor crystals is crucial for advancing modern electronics and optoelectronics. While various crystal growth techniques have been developed for lead halide perovskites, a significant challenge remains: as crystal size increases, performance tends to deteriorate dramatically. This study addresses the inherent limitations of perovskite crystal growth by designing a novel strategy for near-equilibrium growth system to maintain optimal conditions throughout the process. The system consists of three independent units: a solution supply unit, a crystal growth unit, and a solution recycling unit, which together ensure a constant solution concentration and temperature. By systematically optimizing temperature control and solution feeding rates, large and high-quality FAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals, including a notable crystal measuring 51 &#215; 45 &#215; 10 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are successfully produced. This crystal demonstrates a mobility-lifetime product of 2.83 &#215; 10&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&#8315;&#185; and an ultralow detection limit of 319.22 pGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;, significantly surpassing existing perovskite crystals of similar size. The approach can serve as a universal platform for the controlled synthesis of all kinds of perovskite single crystals, laying the foundations for their use in various optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells With Polydopamine&#8208;Coated NaGdF4 Nanoparticles with Ca2+ Chelation Ability for Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaGdF4@PDA&#8208;ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) protect mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from ischemic stroke by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chelating excess Ca2+. This dual action stabilizes Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, reduces oxidative stress, and prevents ROS&#8208;Ca2+ overload cycles, enhancing MSC survival and functionality, and ultimately improving stroke therapy outcomes.









Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. However, the survival of transplanted MSCs is often compromised by the excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions (Ca2+) in the ischemic microenvironment following blood flow occlusion. In this study, a protective strategy is developed using functional nanomaterials to escort and shield MSCs. Specifically, NaGdF4@PDA&#8208;ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) are synthesized, featuring a NaGdF4 core coated with polydopamine (PDA) for ROS scavenging and further modified with alendronate sodium (ALD) for Ca2+ chelation. The internalization of NPANs by MSCs protected them from oxidative damage and calcium overload, thereby promoting their viability and functionality. Furthermore, NaGdF4 generated T1 signal enhancement, enabling in vivo tracking of MSCs via magnetic resonance imaging. The NPANs&#8208;treated MSCs demonstrated improved survival and migration to the ischemic region, promoting blood flow restoration and angiogenesis. These findings confirm the feasibility of employing functional nanoparticles to augment MSCs&#8208;based therapies, offering a promising strategy to improve their therapeutic efficacy in ischemic stroke treatment.

         <title>Bioinspired Super&#8208;Robust Conductive Hydrogels for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Tactile Perception System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired by naturally oriented structures of biological tissues, it developed super&#8208;robust conductive hydrogels with highly tunable mechanical property and anisotropic structure, and demonstrated, for the first time, the mechanical strength of the conductive hydrogels, used as flexible electrodes in triboelectric and piezoresistive device, affected both the accuracy and stability of machine learning&#8208;assisted tactile perception.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels have attracted significant attention due to exceptional flexibility, electrochemical property, and biocompatibility. However, the low mechanical strength can compromise their stability under high stress, making the material susceptible to fracture in complex or harsh environments. Achieving a balance between conductivity and mechanical robustness remains a critical challenge. In this study, super&#8208;robust conductive hydrogels were designed and developed with highly oriented structures and densified networks, by employing techniques such as stretch&#8208;drying&#8208;induced directional assembly, salting&#8208;out, and ionic crosslinking. The hydrogels showed remarkable mechanical property (tensile strength: 17.13&#8211;142.1&#160;MPa; toughness: 50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), high conductivity (30.1 S&#160;m&#8722;1), and reliable strain sensing performance. Additionally, it applied this hydrogel material to fabricate biomimetic electronic skin device, significantly improving signal quality and device stability. By integrating the device with 1D convolutional neural network algorithm, it further developed a real&#8208;time material recognition system based on triboelectric and piezoresistive signal collection, achieving a classification accuracy of up to 99.79% across eight materials. This study predicted the potential of the high&#8208;performance conductive hydrogels for various applications in flexible smart wearables, the Internet of Things, bioelectronics, and bionic robotics.

         <title>Stacked Scintillators Based Multispectral X&#8208;Ray Imaging Featuring Quantum&#8208;Cutting Perovskite Scintillators With 570 nm Absorption&#8208;Emission Shift</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy is introduced to eliminate mutual excitation in stacked scintillator detectors by rare earth ions doped quantum&#8208;cutting scintillators with a significant absorption&#8208;emission shift as the top layer. The developed detector features non&#8208;overlapping optical absorption and RL emission spectra, improving the discrimination of materials with similar densities.








Abstract
Traditional energy&#8208;integration X&#8208;ray imaging systems rely on total X&#8208;ray intensity for image contrast, ignoring energy&#8208;specific information. Recently developed multilayer stacked scintillators have enabled multispectral, large&#8208;area flat&#8208;panel X&#8208;ray imaging (FPXI), enhancing material discrimination capabilities. However, increased layering can lead to&#160;mutual excitation, which may affect the accurate discrimination of X&#8208;ray energy. This issue is tackled by proposing a novel design strategy utilizing rare earth ions doped quantum&#8208;cutting scintillators as the top layer. These scintillators create new luminescence centers via energy transfer, resulting in a significantly larger absorption&#8208;emission shift, as well as the potential to double the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and enhance light output. To verify this concept, a three&#8208;layer stacked scintillator detector is developed using ytterbium ions (Yb3+)&#8208;doped CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) as the top layer, which offers a high PLQY of over 100% and a significant absorption&#8208;emission shift of 570&#160;nm. This configuration, CsAgCl2 and Cs3Cu2I5 as the middle and bottom layers, respectively, ensures non&#8208;overlapping optical absorption and radioluminescence (RL) emission spectra. By calculating the optimal thickness for each layer to absorb specific X&#8208;ray energies, the detector demonstrates distinct absorption differences across various energy bands, enhancing the identification of materials with similar densities.

         <title>Cycloolefin Copolymers With a Multiply Rigid Structure for Protecting Triplet Exciton From Thermo&#8208; and Moisture&#8208;Quenching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycloolefin copolymers bearing hydroxyl, ester, and adamantanyl side groups are synthesized. Upon dispersing various phosphors into this polymer matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full&#8208;color room temperature phosphorescence with lifetimes of 249&#8211;590 ms, showing no obvious luminescence quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments.








Abstract
Polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have been well developed and utilized in various fields. However, their fast thermo&#8208; and moisture&#8208;quenching behavior highly limit their applications in certain harsh environments. Therefore, the preparation of materials with thermo&#8208; and moisture&#8208;resistant phosphorescence is greatly attractive. Compared with common water&#8208;soluble polymers, cycloolefin copolymers (COC) show outstanding hydrophobicity and higher rigidity, even at elevated temperatures, being as a promising candidate to prepare phosphorescence materials with suppressed thermo&#8208; and moisture&#8208;quenching behavior. Herein, a type of COC bearing hydroxyl, ester, and adamantanyl side groups is synthesized. After dispersing various phosphors into this matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full&#8208;color RTP with lifetimes of 249&#8211;590 ms. Their luminescence does not show obvious quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments. In the presence of both rigid COC matrix and rigid phosphors, the corresponding composite displays high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence performance. Even at 378 K, the composite can emit phosphorescence with a lifetime of 40&#8211;98 ms. The applications of these COC&#8208;based composites for imaging, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are thus explored.

Therefore, the preparation of materials with thermo- and moisture-resistant phosphorescence is greatly attractive. Compared with common water-soluble polymers, cycloolefin copolymers (COC) show outstanding hydrophobicity and higher rigidity, even at elevated temperatures, being as a promising candidate to prepare phosphorescence materials with suppressed thermo- and moisture-quenching behavior. Herein, a type of COC bearing hydroxyl, ester, and adamantanyl side groups is synthesized. After dispersing various phosphors into this matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full-color RTP with lifetimes of 249&#8211;590 ms. Their luminescence does not show obvious quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments. In the presence of both rigid COC matrix and rigid phosphors, the corresponding composite displays high-temperature phosphorescence performance. Even at 378 K, the composite can emit phosphorescence with a lifetime of 40&#8211;98 ms. The applications of these COC-based composites for imaging, information encryption, and anti-counterfeiting are thus explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stretchable Blue Phase Liquid Crystal Lasers with Optical Stability Based on Small&#8208;Strain Nonlinear 3D Asymmetric Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;peak stretchable BPLC laser is fabricated based on partially and fully crosslinked networks due to the slow variation of lattice orientation under small strains. The laser exhibits a tuning range of 44.429&#160;nm at 32% strain, providing stable output over a broad&#8208; temperature range with 3D circularly polarized emission under small strains, presenting the potential applications in 3D mechanical perception.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers exhibit exceptional optical quality and tunability to external stimuli, holding significant promise for innovative developments in the field of flexible optoelectronics. However, there remain challenges for BPLC elastomer (BPLCE) lasers in maintaining good optical stability during stretching and varying temperature conditions. In this work, a stretchable laser is developed based on a well&#8208;designed BPLCE with a combination of partially and fully crosslinked networks, which can output a single&#8208;peak laser under small deformation (44.429&#160;nm lasing shift at 32% strain) and a broad&#8208;temperature range (from &#8722;20 to 100&#160;&#176;C). The superior performance can be attributed to the nonlinear 3D asymmetric deformation exhibited by the BPI lattice during stretching, particularly at low deformation rates below 40% strain, which effectively maintains the stability of the body&#8208;centered cubic structure (with the maximum strain of this BPLCE up to 220%). Moreover, the BPLCE exhibits excellent thermal stability over a temperature range from &#8722;180 to 70&#160;&#176;C with a stopband shift of less than &#177;10&#160;nm. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the application of BPLCE laser for morphology sensing and 3D mechanical perception is demonstrated, which paves the way for potential applications of flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Coaxial Direct Ink Writing of Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers in 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;viscosity cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) ink and a silicone ink are prepared for coaxial direct ink writing of 3D strain sensors. The silicone shell supports the CLC core to enable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing in addition to enhancing the mechanical properties of the core. Monostable and bistable thin&#8208;shell domes are printed to demonstrate the 3D printing capabilities and mechanochromic behaviors.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) hold great promise for mechanochromic applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, smart textiles, and soft robotics, thanks to the structural color and elasticity. While CLCEs are printed via direct ink writing (DIW) to fabricate free&#8208;standing films, complex 3D structures are not fabricated due to the opposing rheological properties necessary for cholesteric alignment and multilayer stacking. Here, 3D CLCE structures are realized by utilizing coaxial DIW to print a CLC ink within a silicone ink. By tailoring the ink compositions, and thus, the rheological properties, the cholesteric phase rapidly forms without an annealing step, while the silicone shell provides encapsulation and support to the CLCE core, allowing for layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing of self&#8208;supported 3D structures. As a demonstration, free&#8208;standing bistable thin&#8208;shell domes are printed. Color changes due to compressive and tensile stresses can be witnessed from the top and bottom of the inverted domes, respectively. When the domes are arranged in an array and inverted, they can snap back to their base state by uniaxial stretching, thereby functioning as mechanical sensors with memory. The additive manufacturing platform enables the rapid fabrication of 3D mechanochromic sensors thereby expanding the realm of potential applications for CLCEs.

Abstract
Supercapacitors are rapidly gaining attention as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their superior power and energy densities. This study pioneers the investigation of Mn/Zn co&#8208;doping in &#945;&#8208;Cu&#8322;V&#8322;O&#8327; (CVO) to enhance its performance as a supercapacitor electrode material. Structural and local Structural properties of Mn/Zn co&#8208;doped CVO have been investigated through X&#8208;ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), revealing significant distortions that enhance supercapacitor performance. The optimized sample demonstrates a remarkable specific capacitance of 1950.95&#160;Fg&#8722;1, energy density of 97.54&#160;Whkg&#8722;1, and enhanced capacitive retention, attributed to the unique Cu coordination environment and improved charge transfer kinetics. Temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy unveils spin&#8208;phonon coupling (SPC), particularly in VO&#8324; stretching modes, supported by magnetic measurements that shows a reduction in the N&#233;el temperature and the emergence of zero field&#8208;cooled (ZFC) exchange bias (EB). This work is the first to report the impact of local structure distortion on both supercapacitor performance and SPC in CVO, offering a novel strategy for developing high&#8208;performance energy storage materials with spintronics potential. In addition, the assembled symmetric optimized supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 93.32&#160;Whkg&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability. A prototype device incorporating the optimized CVO successfully powers eight commercial LED bulbs, demonstrating its practical application potential.

         <title>Constructing Anion Solvation Microenvironment Toward Durable High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>

The anion solvation structure is regulated by constructing a high&#8208;salt concentration microenvironment, which maintains highly oxidation&#8208;resistant contact ion pairs and ion aggregation. The tailored solvation structure assists in the formation of robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, restraining the electrolyte oxidation and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at high voltage, which promotes the rate capability and cycling stability of SDIBs over 10&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based rechargeable batteries are some of the most promising candidates for electric energy storage with abundant sodium reserves, particularly, sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) perform advantages in high work voltage (&#8776;5.0&#160;V), high&#8208;power density, and potentially low cost. However, irreversible electrolyte decomposition and co&#8208;intercalation of solvent molecules at the electrode interface under a high charge state are blocking their development. Herein, a high&#8208;salt concentration microenvironment is created and proposed by tailoring the solvation structures of charge carriers including both cations and anions, which maintains highly oxidation&#8208;resistant contact ion pairs and ion aggregates and provides a high ion conductivity. The tailored solvation structure makes a great contribution to protecting the graphite cathode from electrolyte oxidation, solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and structural degradation by constructing a robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with standout electrochemical stability. Based on this, the SDIBs achieved an excellent high&#8208;voltage cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles and the battery showed an improved rate performance with 97.4 mAh g&#8722;1 maintained at 100&#160;C. It is identified that regulating anion solvation structure is responsible for the stable interface chemistry and enhanced reaction kinetics, which provides deep insight into the compatibility design between the electrolyte and specialized charge storage in electrodes.

Based on this, the SDIBs achieved an excellent high-voltage cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles and the battery showed an improved rate performance with 97.4 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; maintained at 100&#160;C. It is identified that regulating anion solvation structure is responsible for the stable interface chemistry and enhanced reaction kinetics, which provides deep insight into the compatibility design between the electrolyte and specialized charge storage in electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Room&#8208;temperature operation or high&#8208;operation temperature (HOT) is essential for mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics devices providing low&#8208;cost and compact systems for numerous applications.

Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature operation or high&#8208;operation temperature (HOT) is essential for mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics devices providing low&#8208;cost and compact systems for numerous applications. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as a rising candidate to enable photodetectors to operate at HOT or room temperature and develop the next&#8208;generation infrared focal plane array (FPA) imagers. Here, band&#8208;engineered heterojunctions are demonstrated to suppress dark current with well&#8208;passivated mercury telluride (HgTe) CQDs enabling room&#8208;temperature MWIR imaging by single&#8208;pixel scanning and 640&#160;&#215;&#160;512 FPA sensitive thermal imaging above 250&#160;K. As a result, the room&#8208;temperature detectivity reaches as high as 1.26&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 Jones, and the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) is as good as 25&#160;mK up to 200&#160;K.

         <title>In&#8208;device Battery Failure Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study analyzes the failure of wireless earbud batteries within their intended usage context. By examining degradations from the material to device level, it reveals that failure patterns are linked to device configuration and operating conditions. The interplay of battery materials, structural design, and microenvironmental factors like temperature gradients offer crucial insights for improving battery integration and reliability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are indispensable power sources for a wide range of modern electronic devices. However, battery lifespan remains a critical limitation, directly affecting the sustainability and user experience. Conventional battery failure analysis in controlled lab settings may not capture the complex interactions and environmental factors encountered in real&#8208;world, in&#8208;device operating conditions. This study analyzes the failure of commercial wireless earbud batteries as a model system within their intended usage context. Through multiscale and multimodal characterizations, the degradations from the material level to the device level are correlated, elucidating a failure pattern that is closely tied to the specific device configuration and operating conditions. The findings indicate that the ultimate failure mode is determined by the interplay of battery materials, cell structural design, and the in&#8208;device microenvironment, such as temperature gradients and their fluctuations. This holistic, in&#8208;device perspective on environmental influences provides critical insights for battery integration design, enhancing the reliability of modern&#160;electronics.

         <title>Vertical Memristive Crossbar Array for Multilayer Graph Embedding and Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of embedding multilayer graphs with minimal complexity and information loss, this study introduces a vertical m&#8208;CBA (vm&#8208;CBA) capable of directly mapping multilayer relationships. By accurately representing inter&#8208;layer and intra&#8208;layer connections in three dimensions, vm&#8208;CBA outperforms conventional embeddings in link prediction and information scores while requiring fewer operations.








Abstract
Graph data structures effectively represent objects and their relationships, enabling the modeling of complex connections in various fields. Recent work demonstrate that metal at diagonal crossbar arrays (m&#8208;CBA) can effectively represent planar graphs. However, they are unsuitable for representing multilayer graphs having multiple relationships across different layers. Using conventional software, embedding multilayer graphs in high&#8208;dimensional Euclidean spaces introduces significant mathematical complexity and computational burden, often resulting in information loss. This study proposes a unique graph embedding (mapping) method utilizing a fabricated vertical m&#8208;CBA (vm&#8208;CBA), where a custom&#8208;built measurement system thoroughly validated its functionality. This structure directly maps multilayer graphs into a 3D vm&#8208;CBA, accurately representing inter&#8208;layer and intra&#8208;layer connections. The practical link prediction and information scores across various real&#8208;world datasets demonstrated that vm&#8208;CBA achieved enhanced accuracy compared to conventional embeddings, even with a significantly decreased number of operations.

         <title>Ultrathin Rare&#8208;Earth Oxyhalides as High&#8208;&#954; van der Waals Layered Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrathin GdOX with a high dielectric constant and breakdown field strength is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated MoS2 transistor gated by monocrystalline dielectric exhibits an on/off current ratio exceeding 109 and a near&#8208;Boltzmann&#8208;limit SS, indicating their tangible applications in 2D electronics.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) dielectrics are extensively employed to enhance the performance of 2D electronic devices. However, current vdW dielectric materials still encounter challenges such as low dielectric constant (&#954;) and difficulties in synthesizing high&#8208;quality single crystals. 2D rare&#8208;earth oxyhalides (REOXs) with exceptional electrical properties present an opportunity for the exploration of novel high&#8208;&#954; dielectrics. In this study, for the first time, the synthesis of a series of van der Waals layered gadolinium oxyhalides with thicknesses down to monolayer through a space&#8208;confined vdW epitaxy approach and demonstrating their application as a single&#8208;crystalline gate dielectric is reported. It exhibits a remarkable relative dielectric constant exceeding 17 and an impressive breakdown field strength of 13.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;A class of ultrathin GdOX with a high dielectric constant and breakdown field strength is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistor gated by monocrystalline dielectric exhibits an on/off current ratio exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and a near-Boltzmann-limit SS, indicating their tangible applications in 2D electronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals (vdW) dielectrics are extensively employed to enhance the performance of 2D electronic devices. However, current vdW dielectric materials still encounter challenges such as low dielectric constant (&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;) and difficulties in synthesizing high-quality single crystals. 2D rare-earth oxyhalides (REOXs) with exceptional electrical properties present an opportunity for the exploration of novel high-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt; dielectrics. In this study, for the first time, the synthesis of a series of van der Waals layered gadolinium oxyhalides with thicknesses down to monolayer through a space-confined vdW epitaxy approach and demonstrating their application as a single-crystalline gate dielectric is reported. It exhibits a remarkable relative dielectric constant exceeding 17 and an impressive breakdown field strength of 13.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

An ultrahigh on/off current ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and a near-Boltzmann-limit subthreshold swing is achieved.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Type III Porous Liquids from Solid Precursors for the Removal and Conversion of Waste CO2 from CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable mechanochemical synthetic approach is reported to fabricate Type III PLs from solid precursors. Owing to the presence of multiple interfacial hydrogen and coordination bonds, these PLs not only maintain porosity and fluidity with high stability, enabling efficient CH4 purification by CO2 removal and sequestration, but also facilitate the catalytic conversion of stored CO2 into valuable products.









Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) have emerged as a promising class of flow porous materials, offering distinctive benefits for sustainable separation processes coupled with catalytic transformations in the chemical industry. Despite their potential, challenges remain in the realms of synthesis complexity, stability, and the strategic engineering of separation and catalytic sites. In this study, a scalable mechanochemical synthetic approach is reported to fabricate Type III PLs from solid precursors with high stability. In these Type III PLs, ZIF&#8208;8 nanocrystals are dispersed in the deep eutectic solvents formed by solid hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors. Owing to the presence of multiple interfacial hydrogen and coordination bonds, these PLs not only maintain porosity and fluidity with high stability, enabling efficient CH4 purification by CO2 removal and sequestration, but also facilitate the catalytic conversion of stored CO2 into valuable products under ambient conditions. This strategy advances the green production of stable and well&#8208;dispersed PLs, showing the potential of PLs in the sustainable separation and catalysis coupling system in the chemical industry.

         <title>Strain Release via Glass Transition Temperature Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Tg (glass transition temperature) regulation (TR) strategy is developed to effectively release residual strain in the perovskite film through adjusting the ratio of monomeric additives. The resulting film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and superior stability. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve a high efficiency of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%) and excellent stability.








Abstract
Thermally induced tensile strain that remains in perovskite films after annealing is one of the key reasons for diminishing the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a glass transition temperature (Tg) regulation (TR) strategy is developed by introducing two polymerizable monomers, 2&#8208;(N&#8208;3&#8208;Sulfopropyl&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyl ammonium)ethyl methacrylate (SBMA) and 2&#8208;Hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), into the perovskite layer. SBMA and HEA undergo in situ polymerization, which regulates the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite film. In addition, adjusting the ratio of SBMA and HEA to lower the Tg of the resulting polymer effectively releases the strain in the perovskite film. The modified film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and improved stability. As a result, the optimized PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%). Furthermore, the encapsulated device demonstrates prominent enhanced operation stability, maintaining 90.3% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h of continuous sunlight exposure.

         <title>Fluid Control of Dip Coating for Efficient Large&#8208;Area Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dip coating is employed to fabricate large&#8208;area organic solar cells. By controlling the fluid characteristics, the correlation among Van der Waals forces in precursor film, aggregation state of polymer, and fibrous orientation in active layer is revealed. Consequently, the dip&#8208;coated 1.0 cm2 rigid and 10.0 cm2 flexible cells exhibit the efficiencies of 17.9% and 13.7%, respectively.








Abstract
As a classical low&#8208;cost technique, dip coating has not been used for printable electronics. Here, the study demonstrates large&#8208;area organic solar cells can be made by dip coating. The correlation is revealed among Van der Waals forces in precursor film, aggregation state of polymer, and fibrous orientation in active layer; the relationship is also expounded between fluid mechanics of the confined liquid in polymer scaffold and the continuity of the acceptor phase. By controlling the fluid characteristics, the ideal nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network forms. As a result, the 1.0 cm2 rigid and 10.0 cm2 flexible cells exhibit efficiencies of 17.9% and 13.7%, respectively. Moreover, the method for predicting the optimal coating speed for the dip coating of given inks is proposed. Overall, this work not only demonstrates the superiority of dip coating for organic solar cell fabrication but also provides guidance for its application in printable electronics.

         <title>Observation of Real&#8208;Time Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Driven Dynamics in Antiferromagnetic Thin Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic dynamics in nanometer&#8208;thick LaFeO&#8323; films is unveiled using time&#8208;resolved Kerr effect, demonstrating ultra&#8208;low damping and spin&#8208;orbit torque manipulation. This study provides an experimental validation of theoretical predictions, offering new insights into nanoscale spintronic systems. The exceptional material quality enables precise probing of dynamics, bridging the gap between antiferromagnetic materials and practical applications in ultrafast spintronics.








Abstract
In the burgeoning field of spintronics, antiferromagnetic materials (AFMs) are attracting significant attention for their potential to enable ultra&#8208;fast, energy&#8208;efficient devices. Thin films of AFMs are particularly promising for practical applications due to their compatibility with spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) mechanisms. However, studying these thin films presents challenges, primarily due to the weak signals they produce and the rapid dynamics driven by SOT, that are too fast for conventional electric transport or microwave techniques to capture. The time&#8208;resolved magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect (TR&#8208;MOKE) has been a successful tool for probing antiferromagnetic dynamics in bulk materials, thanks to its sub&#8208;picosecond (sub&#8208;ps) time resolution. Yet, its application to nanometer&#8208;scale thin films has been limited by the difficulty of detecting weak signals in such small volumes. In this study, the first successful observation of antiferromagnetic dynamics are presented in nanometer&#8208;thick orthoferrite films using the pump&#8208;probe technique to detect TR&#8208;MOKE signal. This paper report an exceptionally low damping constant of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;4 and confirms the AFM magnonic nature of these dynamics through angular&#8208;dependent measurements. Furthermore, it is observed that electrical currents can potentially modulate these dynamics via SOT. The&#160;findings lay the groundwork for developing tunable, energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in next&#8208;generation spintronic applications.

         <title>Dimensional Regulation of Organic n&#8208;Type Dopants for Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimensional regulation strategy of organic dopants is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells. Selenium has a strong electron&#8208;donating ability, which can transfer electrons to perovskites. Specially, 2D&#8208;perylene diimide can coat the perovskite crystal to form a lattice cage through their conjugate skeletons, which passivates the trap states, improves the n&#8208;doping efficiency, and restrains ion migration.








Abstract
A strong n&#8208;type perovskite layer is crucial in achieving high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells, as the weak n&#8208;type perovskites result in a loss of VOC, and the p&#8208;type perovskites contain numerous electron traps that cause the severe carrier recombination. Here, three types of perylene diimide (PDI) based small molecule dopants with different dimensions, including 1D&#8208;PDI, 2D&#8208;PDI, and 3D&#8208;PDI are designed, to produce heavier n&#8208;type perovskites. The PDI&#8208;based molecules with Selenium atoms have a strong electron&#8208;donating ability, effectively enlarging the quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting within the perovskites. Besides, the PDI molecules can coat the surface of the perovskite crystal to form the lattice cage through their conjugate skeletons, which passivates the trap states and improves the n&#8208;doping efficiency, as well as the stabilities of perovskites and related devices. With the addition of the 2D&#8208;PDI, the small&#8208;area solar cells achieved a PCE of 26.06% (25.44% certified) with a high VOC of 1.18&#160;V and a remarkable fill factor of 87.23%. Furthermore, the rigid and flexible perovskite solar modules yielded high PCEs of 21.48% and 20.71%, respectively. This dimensional regulation strategy provides useful guidance for effective n&#8208;type doping and high&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells.

         <title>High Entropy Fine&#8208;Tuning Achieves Fast Li+ Kinetics in High&#8208;Performance Co&#8208;Free High&#8208;Ni Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an efficient and versatile high&#8208;entropy doping strategy. The synergistic effect between high&#8208;entropy dopant elements is optimized by compositional fine&#8208;tuning to overcome the kinetic hysteresis and high reactivity problems that have hindered the development of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials. Excellent long&#8208;cycle stability under fast charging and discharging conditions is achieved.








Abstract
Co&#8208;free high&#8208;Ni layered cathode materials LiNixMeyO2 (Me = Mn, Mg, Al, etc.) are a key part of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity and low cost. However, the hindered Li+ kinetics and the high reactivity of Ni4+ result in poor rate performance and unsatisfied cycling stability. This work designs a promising strategy for designing a high&#8208;performance high&#8208;entropy doping Co&#8208;free high&#8208;Ni layered cathode LiNi0.9Mn0.03Mg0.02Ta0.02Mo0.02Na0.01O2 (HE&#8208;Ni90&#8208;1.557) by elemental screening and compositional fine&#8208;tuning. Compositional fine&#8208;tuning optimizes the synergistic relationship between the high&#8208;entropy dopant elements, thereby significantly suppresses the kinetic hysteresis induced by Li+/Ni2+ mixing. The pillar effect significantly enhances the diffusion kinetics of Li+ at the high state of charge (SOC). Meanwhile, the high&#8208;entropy fine&#8208;tuning significantly postpones the H2&#8208;H3 phase transition and reduces the dissolution of transition metals and the loss of lattice oxygen in the cathodes. Consequently, the diffusion kinetics of Li+ at the atomic and electrode particle scales are significantly enhanced. The HE&#8208;Ni90&#8208;1.557 cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 225.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and a full cell with a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 1500 cycles at 3C. This work provides a promising avenue for commercializing Co&#8208;free high&#8208;Ni cathodes for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Thermophoretic Nanomotors for Superficial Tumor Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spherical core&#8208;shell nanomotor consisting of a polydopamine&#8208;indocyanine green composite shell and a rigid functional core is proposed in this work. This motor can be activated by the NIR&#8208;I irradiation to perform NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;directed thermoplastic propulsion in subcutaneous tissue, enabling an efficient peritumoral administration for low&#8208;risk superficial tumor photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Peritumoral subcutaneous injection has been highly envisioned as an efficient yet low&#8208;risk administration of photothermal agents for superficial tumor photothermal therapy. However, obstructed by complex subcutaneous tissue, the delivery of injected photothermal agents to the specific tumor remains a critical issue. Herein, the study reports a polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;encapsulated spherical core/shell nanomotor with fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) immobilized on its PDA shell. Upon the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) irradiation, this motor can generate favorable photothermal heat, and meantime, emit a robust ICG fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II). The heat turns the motor into an active photothermal agent able to perform thermophoretic propulsion along the irradiation direction in subcutaneous tissue, while the ICG fluorescence can direct the subcutaneous propulsion of motors toward specific tumor through real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II imaging. These functions endow the motor with the ability of moving to tumor after being injected at peritumoral site, enabling an enhanced photothermal therapy (PTT). The results demonstrated herein suggest an integrated nanorobotic tool for the superficial PTT using peritumoral administration, highlighting an NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;directed subcutaneous propulsion.

         <title>Synergistically Enhanced Co&#8208;Adsorption of Reactant and Hydroxyl on Platinum&#8208;Modified Copper Oxide for High&#8208;Performance HMF Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Pt/CuO@CF catalyst is designed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived HMF at high concentrations with excellent recyclability. Experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that Pt modification enhances interfacial active sites, strengthens Pt&#8208;CuO coupling, induces charge redistribution, and adjusts the d&#8208;band structure. These changes effectively improve the adsorption of reactants and hydroxyl groups, contributing to the highly efficient HMFOR.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an environmentally friendly route for producing the sustainable polymer monomer 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Thus, precisely adjusting the synergistic adsorption among key reactive species, such as HMF and OHads, on the carefully designed catalyst surface is essential for achieving satisfactory catalytic performance for HMF oxidation to FDCA as it is closely related to the adsorption strength and configuration of the reaction substrates. This kind of regulation will ultimately facilitate the improvement of HMF oxidation performance. In this work, Pt nanoparticles modified CuO nanowires (denoted as Pt/CuO@CF) are constructed for the selective electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA under alkaline conditions. The well&#8208;designed Pt/CuO@CF demonstrates highly impressive catalytic performance across a range of HMF concentrations, ranging from the commonly used concentrations to higher levels typically not explored (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100&#160;mm) with high FEFDCA (all above 95%) and outstanding long&#8208;term stability (15 cycles). In situ experimental characterizations confirm that the designed heterogeneous interface between Pt and CuO enhances the enrichment of HMF and OHads species on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations reveal the anchored Pt nanoparticles reduce the adsorption barrier for HMF and OHads, thereby promoting the highly selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA.

         <title>Angstrom Confinement&#8208;Triggered Adaptive Spin State Transition of CoMn Dual Single Atoms for Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Angstrom&#8208;confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) CoMn dual single atoms within the carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate for water purification. The angstrom&#8208;confined strategy leads to the adaptive change of atomic spin state, and reduces the energy barrier for *SO5 formation and *O2 desorption during singlet oxygen generation, enabling a 38.6&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen production compared to the surface unconfined one.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in the transformation from peroxymonosulfate to singlet oxygen, adaptive tuning of atomic spin state as the peroxymonosulfate structure varied is crucial. The angstrom confinement can effectively tune spin state, but developing an adaptive angstrom&#8208;confined atomic system is challenging. Angstrom&#8208;confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) dual single atoms within flexible 2D carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to drive adaptive tuning of spin state by changing atomic coordination under angstrom confinement. The in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations showed that medium&#8208;spin Co in Co&#9472;N4 absorbed electrons after the adsorption of peroxymonosulfate on CoMn dual single&#8208;atom sites and then cleaved O&#9472;H of peroxymonosulfate to facilitate *SO5 generation, while the introduction of *SO5 increased interlayer distance and then cleaved Co&#9472;N and Mn&#9472;N, resulting in the spin state transition from medium to high. Subsequently, the high&#8208;spin Co and Mn in Co&#9472;N2 and Mn&#9472;N2 desorbed the *O2 from *SO5, restoring the initial medium spin state. The adaptive spin state transition enhanced 38.6&#8208;fold singlet oxygen yield compared to the unconfined control. The proposed angstrom&#8208;confined diatomic strategy is applicable to serial diatomic catalysts, providing an efficient and universal design scheme for singlet oxygen&#8208;mediated selective wastewater treatment technology at the atomic level.

         <title>Stepwise Coordination Engineering of Pt1/Au25 Dual Catalytic Sites with Enhanced Electrochemical Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges of constructing heterogeneous catalysts with high metal loading, precise structures, and stability are overcome by proposing a stepwise targeted coordination engineering strategy. This approach allows for the co&#8208;anchoring of Pt single atoms and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters on g&#8208;C3N4 and the resulting dual&#8208;site catalysts demonstrate remarkable electrochemical reduction capabilities and enhanced stability throughout the catalytic process.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;site catalysts hold significant promise for accelerating complex electrochemical reactions, but a major challenge remains in balancing high loading with precise dual&#8208;site architecture to achieve optimal activity, stability, and specificity simultaneously. Herein, a strategy of stepwise targeted coordination engineering is introduced to co&#8208;anchor Pt single atoms (Pt1, 1.41&#160;wt.%) and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters (Au25, 18.92 wt.%) with high loadings on graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). This approach ensures that Pt1 and Au25 occupy distinct surface sites on the g&#8208;C3N4 substrate, providing excellent stability and unprecedented electrochemical activity. In the catalysis of As(III), a sensitivity of 8.32 &#181;A ppb&#8722;1 is achieved, more than double the previously reported values under neutral conditions. The enhanced detection limit (0.2&#160;ppb) is crucial for monitoring water quality and protecting public health from arsenic contamination, a significant environmental and health risk. Furthermore, the formation of Pt&#9472;As and As&#9472;S bonds facilitates the easier breakage of As&#9472;O bonds, thereby lowering the reaction barrier energy of the rate&#8208;determining step and significantly enhancing arsenious acid catalysis efficiency. These results not only offer an intriguing strategy for constructing highly efficient heterogeneous dual&#8208;site catalysts but also reveal the atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanisms that drive enhanced catalytic efficiency.

         <title>ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb): New Mn&#8208;Based 2D Magnetoplumbites with Geometric and Magnetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Mn&#8208;based magnetoplumbites, ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb), are discovered, synthesized, and characterized. According to magnetic properties measurements, neutron diffraction, and reverse Monte Carlo refinement, short&#8208;range magnetic correlations are observed in the new materials. These observations reveal 2D magnetic correlations and magnetic frustration in ASb3Mn9O19, making it a promising platform for inducing exotic quantum states.








Abstract
Magnetoplumbites are one of the most broadly studied families of hexagonal ferrites, typically with high magnetic ordering temperatures, making them excellent candidates for permanent magnets. However, magnetic frustration is rarely observed in magnetoplumbites. Herein, the discovery, synthesis, and characterization of the first Mn&#8208;based magnetoplumbite, as well as the first magnetoplumbite involving pnictogens (Sb), ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb) are reported. The Mn3+ (S = 2) cations, further confirmed by DC magnetic susceptibility and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, construct three geometrically frustrated sublattices, including Kagome, triangular, and puckered honeycomb lattices. Magnetic properties measurements revealed strong antiferromagnetic spin&#8211;spin coupling as well as multiple low&#8208;temperature magnetic features. Heat capacity data does not show any prominent &#955;&#8208;anomaly, suggesting minimal associated magnetic entropy. Moreover, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) implied the absence of long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in KSb3Mn9O19 down to 3 K. However, several magnetic peaks are observed in RbSb3Mn9O19 at 3 K, corresponding to an incommensurate magnetic structure. Interestingly, strong diffuse scattering is seen in the NPD patterns of both compounds at low angles and is analyzed by reverse Monte Carlo refinements, indicating short&#8208;range spin ordering related to frustrated magnetism as well as 2D magnetic correlations in ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb).

         <title>A Bifunctional Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimera Nanoplatform for Tumor&#8208;Selective Protein Degradation and Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional lysosome&#8208;targeting chimera nanoplatform (NLTC) is synthesized for tumor&#8208;selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling surface properties and encapsulating catalase, NLTC can efficiently accumulate at tumor tissues and avoid on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor toxicity, synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) and relieve immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for degrading extracellular and membrane&#8208;associated pathogenic proteins by hijacking lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors. However, the antitumor performance of LYTAC is limited by its insufficient tumor accumulation and nonspecific activation. Additionally, the synergistic effects of LYTACs and other therapeutic modalities are crucial. To address these issues, a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform (NLTC) is developed for tumor&#8208;selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling the surface composition, the NLTC can effectively transport extracellular or membrane proteins into lysosomes for degradation via cation&#8208;independent mannose 6&#8208;phosphate receptors. With removable surface modification, an NLTC is obtained that efficiently accumulated in tumor tissues and avoided on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor toxicity. Moreover, the synthesis method of NLTC is generally applicable to various enzymes. Thus, catalase (CAT) is encapsulated with NLTC to synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1), relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy, and significantly inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis in B16F10&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform that can not only perform tissue&#8208;selective protein degradation but also integrate other therapeutic modalities, providing insights into the design of advanced LYTAC technologies for clinical applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for degrading extracellular and membrane-associated pathogenic proteins by hijacking lysosome-targeting receptors. However, the antitumor performance of LYTAC is limited by its insufficient tumor accumulation and nonspecific activation. Additionally, the synergistic effects of LYTACs and other therapeutic modalities are crucial. To address these issues, a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform (NLTC) is developed for tumor-selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling the surface composition, the NLTC can effectively transport extracellular or membrane proteins into lysosomes for degradation via cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors. With removable surface modification, an NLTC is obtained that efficiently accumulated in tumor tissues and avoided on-target off-tumor toxicity. Moreover, the synthesis method of NLTC is generally applicable to various enzymes. Thus, catalase (CAT) is encapsulated with NLTC to synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy, and significantly inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis in B16F10-bearing mice. This work presents a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform that can not only perform tissue-selective protein degradation but also integrate other therapeutic modalities, providing insights into the design of advanced LYTAC technologies for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superstrong Lightweight Aerogel with Supercontinuous Layer by Surface Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZrO2&#8208;SiO2 fiber aerogel with a supercontinuous nanolayer is developed for high&#8208;temperature thermal insulation. The supercontinuous arrangement of ultra&#8208;fine ZrO2 grains on the aerogel surface enables close connections between grains and fibers, promoting efficient transmission of mechanical and thermal stresses, which contributes to record&#8208;high specific strength and remarkable thermal&#8208;insulating behaviors.








Abstract
Breaking the thermal, mechanical and lightweight performance limit of aerogels has pivotal significance on thermal protection, new energy utilization, high&#8208;temperature catalysis, structural engineering, and physics, but is severely limited by the serious discrete characteristics between grain boundary and nano&#8208;units interfaces. Herein, a thermodynamically driven surface reaction and confined crystallization process is reported to synthesize a centimeter&#8208;scale supercontinuous ZrO2 nanolayer on ZrO2&#8208;SiO2 fiber aerogel surface, which significantly improved its thermal and mechanical properties with density almost unchanged (&#8776;26 mg&#160;cm&#8722;3). Systematic structure analysis confirms that the supercontinuous layer achieves a close connection between grains and fibers through Zr&#9472;O&#9472;Si bonds. The as&#8208;prepared aerogel exhibits record&#8208;breaking specific strength (&#8776;84615 N&#160;m&#160;kg&#8722;1, can support up to &#8776;227&#160;272 times aerogel mass) and dynamic impact resistance (withstanding impacts up to 500 times aerogel mass and up to 200 cycling stability at 80% strain). Besides, its temperature resistance has also been greatly optimized (400&#160;&#176;C enhancement, stability at 1500&#160;&#176;C). This work will provide a new perspective for exploring the limits of lightweight, high strength, and thermal properties of solid materials.

         <title>Woven Cement Slurry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A particle&#8208;polymer coalescence strategy is proposed to build balanced particle cohesion, successfully realizing the bending, knotting, coiling, winding, and interlacing of cement slurry for weaving. Beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art formwork casting, grouting, and 3D&#8208;printing, this cement weaving technology may invoke the construction technology revolution and new material and structure design.








Abstract
Weaving, a pivotal technique in human construction activities since the Neolithic era, remains unattainable in modern concrete construction. Here, a novel particle&#8208;polymer coalescence strategy is proposed, which involves electrostatic, bridging, coordinating, and hydrogen bonding interactions, to establish balanced particle cohesion, enabling the fabrication of stretchable cement slurry. The bending, knotting, coiling, winding, and interlacing of cement filaments for structural textiles is successfully realized beyond traditional formwork casting, grouting, and 3D&#8208;printing, and fabricate the first&#8208;ever Chinese knot woven with cement. Weaving construction builds a triaxially cross&#8208;penetrating structure that greatly promotes interlayer strength and toughness by &#8776;208.5% and 676.5% compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer 3D printed structure. These findings not only make a breakthrough in concrete construction technology but also provide solutions for fabricating multi&#8208;directional woven structures with great engineering&#8208;application potentials.

         <title>Embedding Carbon Nanotubes in Artificial Cells Enhances Probe Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liposome&#8208;based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes and carbon nanotubes are embedded in the artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular probe transduction and mass transfer. The strategy accelerates cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission and enables effective sensing of let&#8208;7a and visualizing let&#8208;7a in living colon cancer cells.








Abstract
Monitoring intracellular biomarkers is crucial for clinical disease diagnosis. However, the majority of signaling molecules face difficulties in slow transference across the cell membrane to reach intracellular detection sites, limiting their application in clinical settings. This study proposes an artificial cell&#8208;based signal probe transfer&#8208;enhanced sensing strategy to effectively detect microRNAs (miRNAs) by embedding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in artificial cell membranes. The liposome&#8208;based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes such as nucleic acids, metal ions, and fluorescent dyes. CNTs are embedded in artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular signal probe transduction and mass transfer. Through CNTs&#8208;mediate cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission, the probes pass through the liposome membrane interface and fuse into target cells, selectively hybridizing with the intracellular target miRNAs, triggering a sensing process and resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to prove the enhancement of CNTs&#8208;mediated cell&#8208;cell fusion. This strategy demonstrates excellent analytical performance by quantitatively detecting let&#8208;7a miRNA and visualizing it in living colon cancer cells. These findings hold great significance in promoting and accelerating cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission and enabling effective sensing of intracellular biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.

         <title>Dielectric Regulation in Quasi&#8208;vdW Europium Oxysulfur Compounds by Compositional Engineering for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first synthesis of 2D hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; and tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; with tunable dielectric properties. Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; offers high dielectric performance, while Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; provides a wider bandgap. Integrated into MoS&#8322; field&#8208;effect transistors, these materials demonstrate excellent performance, highlighting their potential as multifunctional dielectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
Advancing next&#8208;generation electronics necessitates precise control of dielectric properties in 2D materials. Here, the first synthesis of novel 2D quasi&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) europium oxysulfur (Eu2SOx) compounds, comprising hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; and tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; phases, with composition&#8208;tunable dielectric properties, is presented. Using a homodiffusive&#8208;controlled epitaxial growth method, materials are achieved with complementary characteristics: the hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; phase exhibits a high dielectric constant (&#8776;30) paired with a moderate bandgap (&#8776;4.56 eV), while the tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; phase offers a wider bandgap (&#8776;5.62 eV) but a lower dielectric constant (&#8776;20). The potential of these materials is demonstrated by integrating ultrathin Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; nanoplates with molybdenum disulfide (MoS&#8322;) field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) via vdW forces. The resulting devices achieve a near&#8208;ideal Ion/Ioff ratio (&#8776;10&#8312;), minimal hysteresis (&#8776;5.3 mV), a low subthreshold slope (&#8776;63.5 mV dec&#8315;&#185;), and ultralow leakage current (&#8776;10&#8315;&#185;&#8308; A). These results highlight the capacity of europium oxysulfur compounds to address the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and bandgap, offering tailored solutions for diverse 2D electronic applications. This work underscores the potential of composition engineering to expand the family of rare&#8208;earth oxysulfur compounds for nanoelectronics, paving the way for innovative gate dielectrics in next&#8208;generation devices.

         <title>Nonlinear Ion Dynamics Enable Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity of Electrochemical Ionic Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear ion dynamics in electrochemical ionic synapses enable spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (STDP) with low energy consumption and minimal variability. The approach supports diverse STDP forms and flexible learning rules across timescales from milliseconds to nanoseconds, enabling spiking neural network hardware with high throughput and adaptability while maintaining low energy consumption and high reliability.








Abstract
Programmable synaptic devices that can achieve timing&#8208;dependent weight updates are key components to implementing energy&#8208;efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs). Electrochemical ionic synapses (EIS) enable the programming of weight updates with very low energy consumption and low variability. Here, the strongly nonlinear kinetics of EIS, arising from nonlinear dynamics of ions and charge transfer reactions in solids, are leveraged to implement various forms of spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (STDP). In particular, protons are used as the working ion. Different forms of the STDP function are deterministically predicted and emulated by a linear superposition of appropriately designed pre&#8208; and post&#8208;synaptic neuron signals. Heterogeneous STDP is also demonstrated within the array to capture different learning rules in the same system. STDP timescales are controllable, ranging from milliseconds to nanoseconds. The STDP resulting from EIS has lower variability than other hardware STDP implementations, due to the deterministic and uniform insertion of charge in the tunable channel material. The results indicate that the ion and charge transfer dynamics in EIS can enable bio&#8208;plausible synapses for SNN hardware with high energy efficiency, reliability, and throughput.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Strain Engineering of High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Oxide Nanoparticles: Regulation by Flame Spray Pyrolysis with Ultrafast Quenching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a continuous&#8208;flow flame spray pyrolysis method for tuning lattice strain in high&#8208;entropy&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. By varying the cooling rates of quenching, tensile strain increases by 2.75%, enhancing oxygen evolution reaction performance with a 25 mV reduction in overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This approach facilitates efficient mass production and precise control of lattice strain.








Abstract
The lattice&#8208;strain engineering of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;oxide nanoparticles (HEO&#8208;NPs) is considered an effective strategy for achieving outstanding performance in various applications. However, lattice&#8208;strain engineering independent of the composition variation still confronts significant challenges, with existing modulation techniques difficult to achieve mass production. Herein, a novel continuous&#8208;flow synthesis strategy by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is proposed, which air varying flow rates is introduced for fast quenching to alter the cooling rate and control the lattice strain of HEO&#8208;NPs. Experimental results demonstrate that as the flow rate of air increases from 0 L to 24 L min&#8722;1, the cooling rate has increased by more than ten times, and the tensile strain of the HEO&#8208;NPs increases by 2.75%. Utilizing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as an indicator, it is observed that the overpotential to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is reduced by 25&#160;mV. Importantly, this approach enables the simple and efficient regulation of lattice strain in HEO&#8208;NPs (110 mg min&#8722;1). Thus, this study provides a new approach for both the mass production and regulation of lattice strain in HEO&#8208;NPs.

         <title>Bioinspired Disordered Aerogel for Omnidirectional Terahertz Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking micro&#8208;pores structures from black butterflies, terahertz response behaviors with incidence&#8208;angle&#8208;insensitive and ultra&#8208;broadband can be effectively controlled through a disordered pore&#8208;induced structural orientation mechanism. In this research, the first investigation is presented into the regulation of terahertz response behaviors via optimized pore structure including disorder, pore parameters, and orientation, regarding as resonance sphere and waveguide system.








Abstract
The structural disorder of the black butterfly assists in capturing sunlight across a wider spectral and angular range, injecting infinite vitality for omnidirectional and stimuli&#8208;responsive wave&#8208;absorbing materials. Here, the disordered micro&#8208;pores responding to terahertz (THz) waves through electromagnetic simulations, and then prepared via ice templating technology are analyzed and optimized. The customized disordered aerogel makes possible perfect terahertz response property with incidence&#8208;angle&#8208;insensitive and ultra&#8208;broadband. Ti3C2Tx MXene/carboxymethyl cellulose aerogels realize excellent shielding effectiveness exceeding 70.32&#160;dB and reflection loss of more than 43.02&#160;dB over the frequency range of 0.3&#8211;1.5 THz. Tailoring the structural orientation of anisotropic aerogels functions as a versatile dynamic modulation approach along terahertz propagation direction. The porous structure with moderate conductivity gradually triggers the resonance effect of the cavity, approximating a resonance sphere (pore) and waveguide system (tube). Ultimately, gradient impedance aerogel is proposed integrating THz&#8208;infrared stealth, hydrophobicity, and mechanical strength. This inspired biomimetic structural strategy will also enable various terahertz applications such as terahertz imaging, line&#8208;of&#8208;sight telecommunication, information encryption, and space exploration.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Vacancy Engineering in Cobalt Selenide Boosts Electrocatalytic Upcycling of Polyester Thermoplastics at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation vacancies&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich cobalt selenide as electrocatalyst to convert polybutylene terephthalate into succinic acid is crafted, which functions well at industrial&#8208;level current density (1.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 @1.477&#160;V vs. RHE). The catalytic mechanism of catalyst and related generality of electrocatalytic upcycling of other polyester thermoplastics are investigated. This work contributes to propel current research frontier of utilization of low&#8208;value carbon resources.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed the increasing accumulation of plastics, posing a daunting environmental crisis. Among various solutions, converting plastics into value&#8208;added products presents a significant endeavor. Here, an electrocatalytic upcycling route that efficiently converts waste poly(butylene terephthalate) plastics into high&#8208;value succinic acid with high Faradaic efficiency of 94.0% over cation vacancies&#8208;rich cobalt selenide catalyst is reported, showcasing unprecedented activity (1.477&#160;V vs. RHE) to achieve an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and featuring a robust operating durability (&#8776;170&#160;h). In particular, when combining butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monomer oxidation (BOR) with hydrogen evolution using the cation vacancy&#8208;engineered cobalt selenide as bifunctional catalyst, a relatively low cell voltage of 1.681&#160;V is required to reach 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, manifesting an energy&#8208;saving efficiency of &#8776;15% compared to pure water splitting. The mechanism and reaction pathways of BOR over the vacancies&#8208;rich catalyst are first revealed through theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ spectroscopic investigations. The generality of this catalyst is evidenced by its powerful electrocatalytic activity to other polyester thermoplastics such as poly(butylene succinate) and poly(ethylene terephthalate). These electrocatalytic upcycling strategies can be coupled with the reduction of small molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2, and NO3&#8722;), shedding light on energy&#8208;saving production of value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>The Optimized Lipid&#8208;Modified Prodrug for CNV Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of SU5402 (SU)&#160;with aliphatic chains containing 20 carbon atoms (SU&#8208;C20 NPs) exhibits an exceptional ability to penetrate the ocular barrier and ensure prolonged drug retention within the eye. These optimized prodrug nanoparticles show a remarkable therapeutic effect in choroidal neovascularization (CNV), resulting in minimal hyperfluorescent leakage and the smallest CNV lesion thickness.








Abstract
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a prevalent cause of vision impairment. The primary treatment for CNV involves intravitreal injections of anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. Nevertheless, this approach still faces numerous limitations like poor patient compliance, high therapy expenditure and lack of response in some individuals. Herein, a series of anti&#8208;neovascularization prodrugs, SU5402 (SU), modified with lipids of varying chain lengths (C12, C16, C20, C24, C28) is synthesized (SU&#8208;C12, SU&#8208;C16, SU&#8208;C20, SU&#8208;C24, SU&#8208;C28). 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as a stabilizer to create nanoformulations of five prodrugs named SU&#8208;C12 NPs, SU&#8208;C16 NPs, SU&#8208;C20 NPs, SU&#8208;C24 NPs, SU&#8208;C28 NPs. Among these, SU&#8208;C20 NPs significantly prolong the retention of bioactive drug in the eye for up to 70 d. Moreover, SU&#8208;C20 NPs demonstrate superior tissue permeability via enhanced cellular endocytosis and exocytosis. With its prolonged retention and improved penetration, SU&#8208;C20 NPs reduce the fluorescence intensity of fundus leakage by 42.5% and the fluorescence area by 51.5% in CNV mice after four weeks, effectively inhibiting the progression of CNV. Altogether, small molecule drug SU is innovatively modified to improve its effectiveness for treating fundus neovascular diseases, proposing an alternative therapy for wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (wAMD).

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulatory Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Flow for Building 600&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1&#8208;Level Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Intra&#8208;particle pores play a practical role in cutting down the electrolyte quantity needed during wetting. A high pore&#8208;throat ratio empowers Li&#8208;rich layered oxides to withstand lean electrolyte conditions at 1.4 g Ah&#8722;1 and achieve a specific energy of 600 Wh kg&#8722;1 in a pouch cell. This accomplishment charts a course for pore&#8208;based regulation in high&#8208;energy storage devices.








Abstract
Reducing excess electrolytes offers a promising approach to improve the specific energy of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, using lean electrolytes presents a significant challenge for porous electrode materials due to heterogeneous wetting. The spontaneous wetting of nano&#8208; or meso&#8208;pores within particles, though seldom discussed, adversely affects wetting under lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, this undesired wetting behavior is mitigated by enlarging the pore&#8208;throat ratio, enabling Li&#8208;rich layered oxide to function effectively at very low electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio of 1.4&#160;g Ah&#8722;1. The resulting pouch cell achieves 606&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and retains 80% capacity (75% energy) after 70 cycles. Through imaging techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that the pore&#8208;throat ratio effectively determines the permeability of electrolyte within particles. By elucidating pore&#8208;relating mechanisms, this work unveils promising potential of manipulating pore structures in porous electrode materials, an approach that can be applied to improve the specific energy of other devices including semi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Ultralight Electrospun Composite Filters with Vertical Ternary Spatial Network for High&#8208;Performance PM0.3 Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative ultralight electrospun nanofiber composite filter,&#160;mass&#8208;produced via an one&#8208;step free surface electrospinning technology, is engineered with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure, featuring elongated internal aperture channels. This advanced TSN filter excels in high&#8208;performance filtration of ultrafine PM0.3 aerosols,&#160;while significantly minimizing material usage. It is designed for recyclability and operates with low energy requirements, ensuring both wearer comfort and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
Air pollutants, particularly highly permeable particulate matter (PM), threaten public health and environmental sustainability due to extensive filter media consumption. Existing melt&#8208;blown nonwoven filters struggle with PM0.3 removal, energy consumption, and disposal burdens. Here, an ultralight composite filter with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure that saves &#8776;98% of raw material usage and reduces fabrication time by 99.4%, while simultaneously achieving high&#8208;efficiency PM0.3 removal (&#8805;99.92%), eco&#8208;friendly regeneration (near&#8208;zero energy consumption), and enhanced wearing comfort (breathability &gt;80&#160;mm s&#8315;&#185;, infrared transmittance &gt;85%), is reported. The TSN filter consists of a hybrid layer of microspheres (average diameter &#8776;1&#160;&#181;m)/superfine nanofibers (&#8776;20&#160;nm) sandwiched between two nanofiber scaffolds (diameter &#8776;400&#160;nm and &#8776;100&#160;nm). This arrangement offers high porosity (&#8776;85%), ultralow areal density (&lt;1&#160;g m&#8722;2), alow airflow resistance (&lt;90&#160;Pa), guaranteeing superb thermal comfort. Notably, utilizing scalable one&#8208;step free surface electrospinning technology, TSN mats can be mass&#8208;produced at a rate of 60 meters per hour (width of 1.6 meters), which is critical and verified for various applications including window screens, individual respiratory protectors, and dust collectors. This work provides a viable strategy for designing high&#8208;performance nanofiber filter media through structural regulation in a scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable way.

         <title>Tailoring Buried Interface and Minimizing Energy Loss Enable Efficient Narrow and Wide Bandgap Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells by Aluminum Glycinate Based Organometallic Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum glycinate&#8208;based organometallic molecule is used to tailor buried interface and minimize interface&#8208;driven energy loss, which realizes high efficiencies of 26.74% and 20.71% for 1.55 and 1.785 eV bandgap perovskite solar cells, respectively.








Abstract
Rational regulation of Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite interface has emerged as a significant challenge in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an organometallic molecule of aluminum glycinate (AG) that contained amine (&#8208;NH2) and aluminum hydroxyl (Al&#8208;OH) groups is developed to tailor the buried interface and minimize interface&#8208;driven energy losses. The Al&#8208;OH groups selectively bonded with unanchored O&#9552;P&#8208;OH and bare NiO&#8208;OH to optimize the surface morphology and energy levels, while the &#8208;NH2 group interacted specifically with Pb2+ to retard perovskite crystallization, passivate buried Pb&#8208;related defects, and release residual interface stress. These interactions facilitate the interface carrier extraction and reduce interface&#8208;driven energy losses, thereby realizing a balanced charge carrier transport. Consequently, AG&#8208;modified narrow bandgap (1.55 eV) PSC demonstrates an efficiency of 26.74% (certified 26.21%) with a fill factor of 86.65%; AG&#8208;modified wide bandgap (1.785 eV) PSC realizes 20.71% champion efficiency with excellent repeatability. These PSCs maintain 91.37%, 91.92%, and 92.00% of their initial efficiency after aging in air atmosphere, the nitrogen&#8208;filled atmosphere at 85&#160;&#176;C, and continuously tracking at the maximum power&#8208;point under one&#8208;sun illumination (100 mW cm&#8722;2) for 1200 h, respectively.

         <title>Constructing Pillar&#8208;Layered Covalent Organic Frameworks via Metal&#8211;Ligand Coordination for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D Pillar&#8208;layered COFs (PL&#8208;COFs) with adjustable interlayer spacing, enhanced crystallinity, and increased porosity are designed and constructed using a pillaring strategy via metal&#8208;ligand coordination, which demonstrates significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion compared to their 2D layered COF counterparts.








Abstract
Growing global concerns over energy security and climate change have intensified efforts to develop sustainable strategies for electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2RR). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for eCO2RR due to their tunable structures, high surface areas, and abundance of active sites. However, the performance of 2D COFs is often limited by layer stacking, which restricts active site exposure and reduces selectivity. To overcome these challenges, a new class of COFs known as pillar&#8208;layered COFs (PL&#8208;COFs) is developed featuring adjustable interlayer spacing and a 3D architecture. Characterization using PXRD, TEM, XPS, and EIS confirmed the successful integration of pillar molecules, which leads to increased interlayer spacing, crystallinity, and porosity. These structural advancements result in significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Density functional theory simulations revealed that enhanced CO2 adsorption and CO desorption contribute to the outstanding performance of PL&#8208;COF&#8208;1, which boasts the largest interlayer spacing. This material achieved an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 91.3% and demonstrated a significant current density, outperforming both the original COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co and PL&#8208;COF&#8208;2. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pillaring strategy in optimizing COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts, paving the way for next&#8208;generation materials for CO2 reduction and sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Crystal Structural Editing: Novel Biaxial MgTe2O5 Crystal as Zero&#8208;Order Waveplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgTe2O5 with 0D structure has been successfully selected and grown as a waveplate crystal. The MgTe2O5 crystal shows tiny birefringence of 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5&#160;&#181;m with a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a novel waveplate crystal and excellent waveplate devices.








Abstract
Waveplates are important optical components to control the polarization of light. Currently, they are often fabricated from uniaxial crystals, and there is no report about waveplates based on the biaxial crystals. In this work, a novel biaxial crystal MgTe2O5 with a structure constructed by 0D Te2O5 groups is designed and grown as waveplate materials for the first time. The exciting result is that the birefringence in the (001)&#8208;plane is smaller than 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5 &#181;m, which is significantly smaller than that of the current waveplate materials. The polarization modulations of the MgTe2O5 devices working at 532 nm indicate that excellent zero&#8208;order half and quarter waveplates have been successfully prepared. In addition, achromatic waveplates used in the visible, near&#8208;infrared, and mid&#8208;infrared ranges have also been calculated. The MgTe2O5 crystal not only exhibits a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2 but also shows a wide transmission range from 0.37 to 6.3 &#181;m. These results provide an excellent waveplate crystal and explore the applications of biaxial crystals.

         <title>Ultrafast Li&#8208;Rich Transport in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Li&#8208;rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conduction in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Negatively charged cation defects intensify the concentration enrichment of Li ions on the nanofiller surface, inducing the formation of interconnected Li&#8208;rich transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;1 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) have garnered considerable attention due to their potential for high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, their widespread development has been hindered by the low ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. In this contribution, a novel Li&#8208;rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conduction in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes. By incorporating cation&#8208;deficient dielectric nanofillers into polymer matrices, it is found that negatively charged cation defects effectively intensify the adsorption of Li ions, resulting in a high Li&#8208;ion concentration enrichment on the surface of fillers. More importantly, these formed Li&#8208;rich layers are interconnected to establish continuous ultrafast Li&#8208;ion transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibited a remarkably low ion transport activation energy (0.17&#160;eV) and achieved an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;1 at room temperature. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mo0.1O2 full cells demonstrated an extended cycling life of over 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 70.7%. This work provides a fresh insight into improving Li&#8208;ion transport by constructing interconnected Li&#8208;rich transport networks, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance SSLMBs.

         <title>Stable and Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Achieved in Spinel Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>

Synopsis: Utilizing a 2D framework matrix, a strategy is presented to balance Cr3&#8314;&#8208;pair emissions at high doping concentrations while effectively suppressing undesirable quenching, thereby ensuring sustained luminescent efficiency.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared emitters related to Cr3+&#8208;pairs for advanced optoelectronic devices remains a challenge due to concentration quenching effects and unclear luminescence mechanisms. In this study, Cr3+ ions are incorporated into a matrix structure consisting of ZnAl&#8322;O&#8324; spinel units separated by 11.312 &#197;, effectively restricting energy transfer between luminescent centers and alleviating quenching effects. Computational analysis identifies the lattice positions of isolated Cr3+ ions and Cr3+&#8208;pairs at different doping levels, providing insights into their spatial distribution and local structural environments. Photoluminescence measurements reveals a Cr3+&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent emission broadening, with a Cr3+&#8208;pair emission band peak at 750&#160;nm, while detailed spectral analysis further clarified the energy level structure of Cr3+&#8208;pairs for the first time. Enhanced material performance is achieved through flux&#8208;assisted synthesis, reaching a high external quantum efficiency of 58.3%. Consequently, the assembled pc&#8208;LEDs exhibit minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off and achieve&#160;a high output of 183&#160;mW at 650&#160;mA, demonstrating their potential in near&#8208;infrared light sources and night vision technology application.

         <title>Zinc Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Encapsulated in Hierarchical Porous Bio&#8208;Carbon Synergistically Enhances Fast Iodine Conversion and Efficient Polyiodide Confinement for Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>

A biomass&#8208;derived carbon integrated with Zn single&#8208;atom catalysts for iodine hosting is designed, integrating the high specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, and nitrogen doping of carbon, along with the excellent chemical confinement and electrocatalytic properties of Zn single atoms. This enabled Zn&#8208;I2 batteries to achieve a long lifespan of 80&#160;000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with 93.6% capacity retention.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, environmental compatibility, and high specific capacity. However, their development is hindered by the severe shuttle effect of polyiodides and the slow redox conversion kinetics of the iodine (I2) cathode. Herein, a long&#8208;life Zn&#8208;I2 battery is developed by anchoring iodine within an edible fungus slag&#8208;derived carbon matrix encapsulated with Zn single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAZn@CFS). The high N content and microporous structure of SAZn@CFS provide a strong iodine confinement, while the Zn&#8208;N4&#8208;C sites chemical interact with polyiodides effectively mitigating the iodine dissolution and the polyiodide shuttle effect. Additionally, the uniformly distributed SAZn sites significantly enhance the redox conversion efficiency of I&#8722;/I3&#8722;/I5&#8722;/I2, leading to improved capacity. At a high current density of 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, the designed Zn&#8208;I2 battery delivers an excellent capacity of 147.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and a long lifespan of over 80&#160;000 cycles with 93.6% capacity retention. Furthermore, the battery exhibits stable operation for 3500 times even at 50&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating significant advances in iodine reversible storage. This synergistic strategy optimizes composite structure, offering a practical approach to meet the requirements of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Mediated Photoacoustic/NIR&#8208;II and Photodynamic Properties of pH&#8208;Reversible Thiopyrylium Agents: A Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents an innovative approach to developing pH&#8208;responsive thiopyrylium&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with enhanced photoacoustic and photodynamic properties. By precisely modulating molecular aggregation, the study demonstrates significant advances in tumor&#8208;targeted dual&#8208;modal imaging and therapy, providing a promising pathway for future cancer diagnosis and treatment.








Abstract
Aggregation profoundly influences the photophysical properties of molecules. Here, a new series of thiopyrylium&#8208;based hemicyanine near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores is developed by meticulously adjusting their aggregation states. Notably, the star molecule HTPA exhibits a remarkable pH&#8208;responsive behavior and a significant increase in photoacoustic (PA) intensity when aggregated. Additionally, their behavior and pH reversibility during aggregation formation are systematically investigated, including computational optimization, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, NMR analysis, and single crystal analysis. Finally, an innovative &#8220;off&#8201;&#8221; nanoparticle specifically is designed for effective tumor&#8208;targeted PA/NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;modal imaging and photodynamic therapy by utilizing a pH&#8208;responsive polymer. The signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of PA signals significantly increased to 169 in the region of interest (ROI) in the mouse model when irradiated at 1064&#160;nm. These findings not only provide a promising avenue for future studies of NIR&#8208;II small molecules but also pave the way for significant advances in the field of integrated cancer diagnosis and therapy.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controllable High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Toward Stable Hydrogen Production at Industrial&#8208;Scale Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst capable of stable hydrogen precipitation at current densities of &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 is successfully developed with negligible activity loss over 100 h. This work offers new insights and approaches for designing HEAs that reliably produce hydrogen at high current densities.








Abstract
Efficient and stable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at high current densities is highly desirable for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production, which is yet challenging, because of the electrocatalyst with short lifespans during the acidic HER process. Here, a controllable preparation technique is successfully developed to synthesize PdPtRuRhAu high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) of various sizes, within the 3.14&#160;nm particles (HEA&#8208;3.14) demonstrating exceptional catalytic performance and stable hydrogen production at current densities of &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 with negligible activity loss over 100&#160;h. Theoretical calculations indicate that the bridge adsorption site of Pd&#8211;Au serves as an ideal location for HER, with HEA&#8208;3.14 possessing the highest proportion of such sites, reaching 18.97%. To further analyze the thermodynamic stability of HEAs, an element&#8208;encoding machine learning model is developed from over 300&#160;000 preprocessed dataset of HEAs that achieving an impressively low RMSE of 58.6&#160;&#176;C and a high R2 value of 0.98. By integrating thermodynamic modeling with machine learning methods, the melting point of the PdPtRuRhAu HEAs at 3.14&#160;nm (366&#160;&#176;C) is predicted, which aligns well with the results obtained from differential scanning calorimetry tests. This work offers new insights and approaches for designing HEAs that reliably produce hydrogen at high current densities.

Metallic MoO3&#8208;x is successfully prepared at the kilogram scale and exhibits an outstanding STA efficiency (&#8776;0.3%) under simulated&#8208;solar irradiation. Its potential scalability of the large&#8208;scale photocatalytic system stems from a high STA efficiency (0.03%) and good stability (6 days) of the 1&#160;m2 panel reactor system, yielding solar fertilizer ((NH4)2SO4).








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to convert molecular N2 into nitrogen&#8208;rich chemicals (e.g., ammonia) provides a potential pathway for the manufacture of &#8220;solar fertilizers&#8221;. However, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (STA) efficiency of most solar fertilizer systems developed to date is less than 0.1%. Herein, an outstanding STA efficiency of &#8776;0.3% using a metallic molybdenum trioxide (metallic MoO3&#8208;x) photocatalyst under simulated&#8208;solar irradiation is reported, with localized surface plasmon resonance phenomena in the metallic MoO3&#8208;x photocatalyst enhancing both light utilization and N2 activation. The potential scalability of the photocatalytic technology is demonstrated in a 1&#160;m2 panel reactor system, with a high STA efficiency and good stability demonstrated over 6 days of outdoor testing, yielding a solid (NH4)2SO4 product for easy collection. The as&#8208;designed square&#8208;meter outdoor reaction system facilitates the integration of solar fertilizer technology with existing agricultural infrastructure.

         <title>Giant Capacitive Energy&#8208;Storage in BaTiO3&#8208;Based Fine&#8208;Grained Relaxors via Local Polarization Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Industrial pillar Barium titanate&#8208;based bulk ceramic capacitors suffer from low energy storage density, hindering their use in advanced applications. By designing a favorable local structure and optimizing chemical composition to improve local polarization and refine grain structure, energy density above 15 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 is achieved, along with superior overall performance, overcoming the current bottleneck of this capacitor type.








Abstract
Pb&#8208;free dielectric energy storage capacitors are core components in advanced pulse&#8208;power electronic systems and devices. However, the relatively low energy density (Wrec) for the industrial pillar BaTiO3 (BT)&#8208;based capacitors remains a significant obstacle for their cutting&#8208;edge applications, due to their low intrinsic polarization and breakdown strength (EB). Herein, through chemical composition and local structure design, a giant Wrec of 15.1 J cm&#8722;3 along with a high efficiency (&#951;) of 85% is demonstrated in a BT&#8208;based relaxor bulk ceramic. This is achieved by introducing rare A&#8208;site polarization enhancement substitution (Bi0.5Na0.5)2+ ions in combination with B&#8208;site fastest relaxation alternative (Zn1/3Nb2/3)4+ ions to enhance local polarization and refine grain structure. Atomic&#8208;level local structure analysis has revealed that the diversified atomic polar displacement vectors, characterized by largely extended magnitude and heterogeneous directions, assemble into highly polarizable clusters at several unit&#8208;cells scale. Consequently, it exerts a large polarization difference (&#916;P) of 49 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 and a high EB of 90&#160;kV mm&#8722;1. Moreover, a giant power density (677 MW cm&#8722;3), high discharge energy density (3.9 J cm&#8722;3), and excellent stability are achieved. This study overcomes the current Wrec bottleneck of &#8776;10 J cm&#8722;3 in BT&#8208;based bulk ceramics, presenting an approach to optimize the energy storage performance of Pb&#8208;free relaxors.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Cost, Open&#8208;Source 3D Printer for Multimaterial and High&#8208;Throughput Direct Ink Writing of Soft and Living Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 10, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Printess is a low&#8208;cost, open&#8208;source, multimaterial 3D printer for direct ink writing. Built for under $250, it is highly customizable and supports various advanced direct ink writing modalities, including multimaterial mixing, multimaterial multinozzle, and embedded 3D printing. The bioprinter's easy assembly, low cost, and high precision make it suitable for both research and educational settings.









Abstract
Direct ink writing is a 3D printing method that is compatible with a wide range of structural, elastomeric, electronic, and living materials, and it continues to expand its uses into physics, engineering, and biology laboratories. However, the large footprint, closed hardware and software ecosystems, and expense of commercial systems often hamper widespread adoption. This work introduces a compact, low&#8208;cost, multimaterial, and high&#8208;throughput direct ink writing 3D printer platform with detailed assembly files and instructions provided freely online. In contrast to existing low&#8208;cost 3D printers and bioprinters, which typically modify off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf plastic 3D printers, this system is built from scratch, offering a lower cost and full customizability. Active mixing of cell&#8208;laden bioinks, high&#8208;throughput production of auxetic lattices using multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing methods, and a high&#8208;toughness, photocurable hydrogel for fabrication of heart valves are introduced. Finally, hardware for embedded multinozzle and 3D gradient nozzle printing is developed for producing high&#8208;throughput and graded 3D parts. This powerful, simple&#8208;to&#8208;build, and customizable printing platform can help stimulate a vibrant biomaker community of engineers, biologists, and educators.

         <title>Precise Control Over Crystallization Kinetics by Combining Nucleating Agents and Plasticizers for 20.1% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallization&#8208;kinetics modulation strategy has been developed to synergistically regulate the hierarchical morphology in a typical bulk heterojunction blend, via introducing a polymer donor and a small molecule acceptor as the nucleation agent and plasticizer, respectively. Consequently, a decent device efficiency of 20.1% is obtained.








Abstract
Obtaining controllable active layer morphology plays a significant role in boosting the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a quaternary strategy, which incorporates polymer donor D18&#8208;Cl and small molecule acceptor AITC into the host D18:N3, is employed to precisely modulate crystallization kinetics for favorable morphology evolution within the active layer. In situ spectroscopic measurements during film&#8208;formation demonstrate that while D18&#8208;Cl works as a nucleator to promote aggregation of D18 and foster donor/acceptor intermixing, AITC has exactly the opposite impact on aggregation of N3 and intermixing kinetics of donor and acceptor, working as a plasticizer. The mutually compensational effect of the dual&#8208;guests, as a result, enables synergistic control over fibrillar networks, multi&#8208;length scale morphology, and vertical phase distribution, leading to optimized 3D morphology for greatly enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer, suppressed charge recombination, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, the quaternary OSCs based on D18:D18&#8208;Cl:N3:AITC achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which represents one of the highest efficiencies for single&#8208;junction OSCs. This work presents an effective strategy to precisely regulate crystallization kinetics toward advanced morphology control for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Unraveling Compressive Strain and Oxygen Vacancy Effect of Iridium Oxide for Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized nickel&#8208;doped iridium (Ir) dioxide catalyst with optimized compressive strain and oxygen (O) vacancies, enhances Ir&#9472;O covalency, reduces the Ir&#9472;Ir distance, and accelerates water&#160;adsorption, breaking the linear scaling relationship of intermediates binding for efficient oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), but the linear scaling relationship (LSR) of multiple reaction intermediates binding inhibits the enhancement of its activity. Herein, the compressive strain and oxygen vacancy effect exists in iridium dioxide (IrO2)&#8208;based catalyst by a doping engineering strategy for efficient acidic OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations elucidate that compressive strain can enhance Ir&#9472;O covalency and reduce the Ir&#9472;Ir bond distance, and oxygen vacancy (Ov) as an electronic regulator causes rapid adsorption of water molecules on the Ir and adjacent Ov (Ir&#9472;Ov) pair site to be coupled directly into *O&#9472;O* intermediates. Importantly, hence, volcano&#8208;shape curves are established between the compressive strain/oxygen vacancy and OER current using OER as the probe reaction. Theoretical calculation reveals Ni dopant can modulate Ir 5d&#8208; and O 2p&#8208;band centers for increasing overlap of Ir 5d and O 2p orbits to trigger a continuous metal site&#8208;oxygen vacancy synergistic mechanism (MS&#8208;OVSM) pathway, successfully breaking the LSR of intermediates binding during OER. Therefore, the resultant proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) device fabricated using T&#8208;0.24Ni/IrO2 delivers a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and operates stably for 500&#160;h.

         <title>Geometric Design of Interface Structures and Electrolyte Solvation Chemistry for Fast Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;grain&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) geometry can provide sufficient paths for excellent Li+ ion supply capacity, and a soft&#8208;solvating electrolyte can enhance the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast charging conditions. Isobutyronitrile&#8208;based electrolytes provide high discharge capacity during fast charging cycles while mitigating lithium plating on the anode.








Abstract
The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li+ ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions during fast&#8208;charging of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile&#8208;based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li+ ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN&#8208;containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li+ ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 &#176;C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.

         <title>Monochromatic Responsive HOF Heterostructures via VIA&#8208;Group&#8208;Based Framework Hybridization for Fully&#8208;Covert Photonic Barcode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monochromatic responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructure is first achieved based on the VIA&#8208;group&#8208;based framework hybridization, which enables the concealment of intrinsic fingerprint character and the expression of multicolor responsive mode, further serving as fully&#8208;covert photonic barcodes. These findings offer novel insight on exploitating smart&#8208;responsive hetero&#8208;HOFs for high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices.








Abstract
Luminescent responsive heterostructures with region&#8208;domained emission and integrated responsiveness exhibit great potential in information security, but always suffer from the direct exposure of fingerprint information at the initial state, making it easy to decode the hidden confidential information. Herein, the first monochromatic responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructures are reported based on VIA&#8208;group&#8208;based framework hybridization toward fully&#8208;covert photonic barcodes. Designed HOF blocks with different VIA&#8208;group elements are integrated via a configuration&#8208;assimilation&#8208;based assembly method to generate the intrinsic monochromatic HOF heterostructures. Differentiated electronegativity of VIA&#8208;group elements endows each HOF block with distinct bonding stability, which triggers different responsive actions to the same stimuli, finally forming the multicolor emission mode at a responsive state. These monochromatic responsive HOF heterostructures can effectively hide the intrinsic fingerprint information, which further demonstrates the fully&#8208;covert photonic coding capability as high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. These findings offer novel insight on the exploitation of smart&#8208;responsive hetero&#8208;HOF systems for advanced information encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Galvanic Cell Bipolar Microneedle Patches for Reversing Photoaging Wrinkles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microneedles reverse photoaging wrinkles. In this study, a magnesium galvanic cell bipolar microneedle composed of redox reaction is introduced. Through playing the role of antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, cell migration, angiogenesis and so on, it can combine action of hydrogen, magnesium ion and micro&#8208;current to repair the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation and rejuvenate the skin.








Abstract
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major factor in the development of skin photoaging wrinkles. While current treatments can slow the progression of photoaging, it is very difficult to achieve complete reversal. This study introduces galvanic cell microneedle (GCMN) patches with magnesium&#8208;containing bipolar electrodes. These patches operate through a galvanic cell mechanism, generating microcurrents and releasing hydrogen gas and magnesium ions via a redox reaction. The combination of hydrogen's antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, microcurrent&#8208;induced stimulation of cell migration, and magnesium's promotion of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization synergistically works to reverse photoaging wrinkles and rejuvenate the skin. Furthermore, this work examines how GCMNs may influence the transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;/Smad (TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) pathway. This approach shows promise for advancing research and development in the field of medical cosmetology.

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Catalytic N&#9472;Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites, incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.








Abstract
Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion&#8208;diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (KxTey). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe2 composite equipped with a self&#8208;catalytic center (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self&#8208;catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC provides a short&#8208;range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K+ diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N&#9472;Co bonds self&#8208;catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for KxTey under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te&#8208;based anodes. Finally, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of KxTey and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong&#8208;lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.

Consequently, they find extensive applications in diverse fields such as biology, sensing, photoelectricity, and lasers. Henceforth, they are particularly suitable for constructing biological lasers. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the classification and application of existing biological lasers while emphasizing the advantages of CDs compared to other gain media. Furthermore, it presents the latest progress made by utilizing CDs as gain media and forecasts both promising prospects and potential challenges for biological lasers based on CDs. This study aims to enhance understanding of CD lasers and foster advancements in the field of biological lasers.

         <title>Mesoporous Nanogel Sprays as Universal Evaporation Interface Modifiers for Boosting Water&#8208;Cluster Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface spraying technique enhances evaporation materials, boosting solar&#8208;driven evaporation rates by 297% versus controls with broad substrate compatibility. Its nanogel spray featuring nanoconfined pores facilitates water&#8208;cluster formation and diffusion, reducing evaporation enthalpy to advance seawater desalination technologies. 








Abstract
Accelerating water evaporation is vital for processes like photosynthesis, dehydration, and desalination. Optimizing the pore structure and interfacial properties of evaporative materials can reduce evaporation enthalpy and increase efficiency. However, integrating the evaporation interface with water transport channels poses significant design challenges and complicates low&#8208;enthalpy evaporation analysis. To address these challenges, a hydrophilic nanovesicle gel is developed with a hydrophobic mesoporous structure as an ideal spray. This spray effectively upgrades their interface of universal substrates (including PVA hydrogels, balsa wood, nanofiltration membrane, cellulose paper, nylon fabrics, etc.), enabling the simple preparation of evaporation materials. The sprayed samples, at a low spraying dose of 40&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, achieved evaporation rates of 1.58 and 3.26&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 under 0.5 and 1 sun irradiance, which are 297% and 268% higher than their respective substrates. These nanogels offer benefits like edibility, low cost, ease of use, and compatibility with various substrates, showing great potential in seawater desalination, dehydration technology, crop yield enhancement, and coating/paint drying. More importantly, this work highlights the need for researchers to focus on the surface structure of materials, rather than merely using bulk gels, in the development of high&#8208;performance evaporative materials.

         <title>3D Soft Liquid Metal Electrodes for High&#8208;Resolution and Long&#8208;Term Electromyography in Muscle Trauma Assessment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the development of soft, biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) for high&#8208;resolution, long&#8208;term electromyography recording is done. In human and in vivo animal trials, LMe captures continuous neuromuscular signals of the muscle, evaluating the efficacy of rehabilitative drugs for muscle trauma. This work enables improved diagnostics and drug modeling for muscle disorders using a soft device interface.








Abstract
Electromyography (EMG) is a widely used diagnostic technique for evaluating the electrical activity of muscles and their controlling nerves. However, conventional surface electrodes with planar structures often suffer from low spatial resolution and suboptimal signal quality. Here, 3D&#8208;shaped, substrate&#8208;free, soft, and biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) are presented as a wearable interface for neuromuscular signal recording. These electrodes enable the acquisition of high&#8208;quality EMG signals while their intrinsic mechanical softness supports long&#8208;term use in clinical settings. In a human pilot study, continuous, high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution EMG monitoring of musculoskeletal activity over 25 days is achieved. Furthermore, in vivo EMG monitoring in mouse models of ischemia and volumetric muscle loss demonstrated the therapeutic effects of extracellular muscle&#8208;rehabilitative drugs. This work highlights the potential of LMe for advanced drug screening and long&#8208;term clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Morphologically Switchable Au Nanowire and Hemoglobin&#8208;Resveratrol Nanoparticles in the Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Healing Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve synergistic therapy of diabetic wounds, morphologically switchable Au nanowires (ANW) and resveratrol&#8208;hemoglobin (HR) nanoparticles are co&#8208;loaded into the microneedles. The morphologically adaptable ANW continuously consumes glucose, while HR improves hypoxia, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and inhibits the differentiation of M1&#8208;type macrophages. This work thus realizes the long&#8208;term management of glucose during synergistic diabetic wound healing therapy.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes and pose a significant threat to human health. High glucose concentration in the wound remains a major obstacle, necessitating effective strategies to achieve sustained glucose consumption for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In this study, an Au&#8208;based nanomaterial is developed that can adjust its morphology in different therapeutic processes. The prepared Au nanowire (ANW) can be converted into Au nanospheres (AS) under ultrasonic conditions by adjusting the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on its surface for convenient delivery. Intriguingly, AS is depolymerized into ANW again in the wound area, prolonging the retention time, and ensuring continuous consumption of glucose. After constructing the morphologically switchable Au nanowire, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is applied it to microneedle and co&#8208;delivered it with hemoglobin (Hb)&#8208;resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)&#8208;induced diabetic mouse model, the microneedle degraded gradually, and the Hb&#8208;RES nanoparticles synergistically ameliorated hypoxia, scavenged ROS, and inhibited macrophage differentiation into pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 phenotypes. During this process, ANW continuously catalyzed glucose through its inherent glucose oxidase activity. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the long&#8208;term management of glucose concentration during synergistic diabetic wound healing.

         <title>Scalable Van Der Waals Integration of III&#8208;N Devices Over 2D Materials for CMOS&#8208;Compatible Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an innovative technology is presented that will transform current monolithic and heterogeneous integration by using BEOL&#8208;compatible fluidic&#8208;assisted self&#8208;alignment transfer and integration process. Multi&#8208;dimensional integration of III&#8208;N optical and electronic devices over 2D materials on CMOS is demonstrated with no epitaxial constraints or different process thermal budgets.









Abstract
Advances in semiconductor technology have been primarily driven by exponentially reducing the size of silicon transistors and pushing the quantum limit. However, continued scaling becomes extremely difficult in accordance with Moore's law. Conversely, recent advances in monolithic and heterogeneous integration by exploring non&#8208;group IV materials envision beyond CMOS scaling. This study entails the development of scalable van der Waals (vdW) integration technology by using all CMOS back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line&#8208;compatible processes: vertical 3D and lateral 2D integration of III&#8208;N devices, 2D materials (graphene and molybdenum disulfide), and CMOS. Advanced fluidic&#8208;assisted self&#8208;alignment transfer (FAST) provides a process accuracy of &#8776; 32.6 nm as analyzed on a 200 mm wafer scale. The freestanding III&#8208;N chips are vdW integrated onto 2D materials, and the vdW interfaced multi&#8208;layer graphene successfully functioned as a back&#8208;gating interconnect line. Moreover, fidelity of the vdW interface is confirmed by conducting systematic yield, uniformity, and reliability analysis. The unique fourfold rotationally symmetric design of GaN transistors makes them compatible with massive and random FAST processing. GaN&#8208;based radio&#8208;frequency power and cascode GaN/Si transistors are integrated on silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator&#8208;CMOS. The proposed approach affords a remarkable advantage by surpassing the physical limits and facilitating functional diversification, thus advancing the concept of &#8220;More than Moore.&#8221;

         <title>Modulation of Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Luminescence in Inorganic Nanomaterials for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR&#8208;ALINs) are fascinating due to their optical property of continuing to emit near&#8208;infrared luminescence after excitation ceases. This review highlights recent progress in the rational design, modulation strategies and biological applications of NIR&#8208;ALINs. The challenges and opportunities in this field are discussed with the aim of stimulating further developments in biological applications using NIR&#8208;ALINs.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR&#8208;ALINs) possess the unique property of continuing to emit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence after excitation ceases. They demonstrate excellent photostability, deep tissue penetration, and high imaging signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, NIR&#8208;ALINs can be re&#8208;excited in vivo using visible (Vis), NIR light or X&#8208;rays, which avoids the need for continuous in situ excitation, thus eliminating autofluorescence of biological tissues and reducing the tediousness of multiple injections.

&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR-ALINs) are fascinating due to their optical property of continuing to emit near-infrared luminescence after excitation ceases. This review highlights recent progress in the rational design, modulation strategies and biological applications of NIR-ALINs. The challenges and opportunities in this field are discussed with the aim of stimulating further developments in biological applications using NIR-ALINs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR-ALINs) possess the unique property of continuing to emit near-infrared (NIR) luminescence after excitation ceases. They demonstrate excellent photostability, deep tissue penetration, and high imaging signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, NIR-ALINs can be re-excited in vivo using visible (Vis), NIR light or X-rays, which avoids the need for continuous in situ excitation, thus eliminating autofluorescence of biological tissues and reducing the tediousness of multiple injections. These features make NIR-ALINs particularly attractive for biological applications. In recent years, a series of NIR-ALINs with prolonged afterglow time and enhanced luminescence intensity have been discovered. However, the development of NIR-ALINs still faces significant challenges, as their NIR afterglow performance is usually insufficient to satisfy practical biological applications. There is still a lack of systematic analysis of the strategies for the regulation of NIR afterglow luminescence in inorganic nanomaterials. This review highlights the rational design and modulation strategies of NIR-ALINs, focusing on host substrate selection, trap engineering modulation and surface modification. Moreover, the biological applications of NIR-ALINs in bioimaging, bio-detection and disease therapy are summarized. Finally, the present challenges and perspectives in biological applications, such as insufficient afterglow properties and unclear biosafety, are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skin&#8208;Inspired and Self&#8208;Regulated Hydrophobic Hydrogel for Diabetic Wound Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;mimetic smart hydrophobic hydrogel is developed for efficient diabetic wound therapy. Thehydrophobic segments form dense &#8220;epidermis&#8221;, ensuring prolonged drug diffusion, long&#8208;term water retention, and high water content. Meanwhile, the responsive segments generate glucose&#8208;labile &#8220;sweat pores&#8221;, facilitating on&#8208;demand drug release to remodel the hostile wound microenvironment.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are refractory and recurrent diseases that necessitate the development of multifunctional dressings. Inspired by the structure and function of the skin, we herein delicately design a novel swollen hydrophobic hydrogel (QL@MAB) composed of hydrophobic methyl acrylate (MA) and (3&#8208;acrylamidophenyl)boronic acid (AAPBA) network and co&#8208;loaded with antioxidant quercetin (Q) and antibiotic levofloxacin (L) for efficient diabetic wound therapy. The hydrophobic MA segments undergo phase separation to form a dense &#8220;epidermis&#8221;, ensuring prolonged drug diffusion, long&#8208;term water retention, and high water content. Meanwhile, the AAPBA segments generate glucose&#8208;labile &#8220;sweat pores&#8221; via borate ester bonds with the polyphenol drug Q. Upon encountering the hyperglycemic wound microenvironment, the &#8220;sweat pores&#8221; are dilated due to the cleavage of the borate ester bonds and exposure of the diffusion channel, facilitating drug release for accelerated wound healing. In the infected diabetic rats, QL@MAB achieves rapid wound debridement and re&#8208;epithelization while promoting angiogenesis, hair follicle regeneration, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Taken together, this study not only represents a multipronged dressing for effective interventions of diabetic wounds but also contributes to the rational design of smart hydrogels tailored for biomedical applications.

         <title>Achieving Zero Leakage, Ultralong Lifespan, and Intrinsic Opening Sensing in Microvalves Through Structural Superlubrication and Triboelectric Nanogenerator Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero leakage, ultralong lifespan, and intrinsic opening sensing are achieved in microvalves, making it feasible to develop high&#8208;performance fluid operation chips and integrated drive&#8208;control systems, which promote the miniaturization, integration, and flexibility of pneumatic flexible robots and human&#8208;machine interaction devices.








Abstract
Valves are critical components in advanced fluid control systems (AFCS) and play a vital role in applications such as soft robotics and medical devices. Traditional mechanical valves often suffer from issues such as leakage and wear, which compromise the efficiency and precision of air&#8208;driven systems. Here, a superlubricity microvalve (SLMV) is developed with characteristics of zero leakage, ultralong lifespan, and self&#8208;sensing capabilities. The SLMV demonstrates zero helium leakage at pressures exceeding 0.9&#160;MPa, and remains defect&#8208;free after one million collision tests and 5000 reciprocating sliding friction tests. Additionally, the valve features self&#8208;powered sensing that can detect its own open status, and thus enhances the self&#8208;feedback control. AFCS equipped with SLMVs may significantly improve the flexibility and functionality of pneumatic robots, facilitating the development of implantable drug delivery devices that are more durable, compact, safe, and reliable.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enhanced Trial&#8208;and&#8208;Error for Efficient Optimization of Rubber Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel workflow termed machine&#8208;learning (ML)&#8208;enhanced trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, for efficient optimization of rubber composites. This approach integrates orthogonal experimental design with symbolic regression to proficiently extract empirical principles. This integrated approach not only preserves the features of conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodologies but also substantially enhances their efficiency and effectiveness.








Abstract
The traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, although effective, is inefficient for optimizing rubber composites. The latest developments in machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted methodologies are also not suitable for predicting and optimizing rubber composite properties. This is due to the dependency of the properties on processing conditions, which prevents the alignment of data collected from different sources. In this work, a novel workflow called the ML&#8208;enhanced trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach is proposed. This approach integrates orthogonal experimental design with symbolic regression (SR) to effectively extract empirical principles. This combination enables the optimization process to retain the characteristics of the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach while significantly improving efficiency and capability. Using rubber composites as the model system, the ML&#8208;enhanced trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach effectively extracts empirical principles encapsulated by high&#8208;frequency terms in the SR&#8208;derived mathematical formulas, offering clear guidance for material property optimization. An online platform has been developed that allows for no&#8208;code usage of the proposed methodology, designed to seamlessly integrate into the existing experimental optimization process.

         <title>Synchronizing Multicolor Changes and Shape Deformation Into Structurally Homogeneous Hydrogels via a Single Photochromophore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiropyran&#8208;derived photochromphore that exhibits a concurrent molecular alteration in fluorescence and charge upon irradiation is reported, which simultaneously enables both photochromic and photodeformable capability upon covalent incorporation into a structurally homogenous hydrogel. The engineered hydrogel system demonstrates synchronized multicolor changes (from red to green) and shape deformation (from positive to negative phototropism) under a single stimulus of light illumination.








Abstract
The design of synthetic hydrogels that can mimic their biological counterparts in the simultaneous production of multicolor change and shape transformation in response to environmental stimuli is of great importance toward intelligent camouflage, encryption, and actuation. Previous efforts have focused primarily on developing heterogeneous hydrogels that highly rely on respective mechanisms to achieve color and shape changes separately, and synergistically synchronizing such two variations into structurally homogenous hydrogels via a single chromophore has been challenging. Here, the molecular design of a structurally homogenous hydrogel simultaneously exhibiting synchronized multicolor change and shape deformation triggered by a single stimulus of light is reported. The synchronization mechanism originates from a coupled alteration upon irradiation in the fluorescence emission and charge states of a spiropyran photochromophore covalently incorporated into the hydrogel network, thus leading to macroscale color change and shape variation in the hydrogel, respectively. Following this principle, both positive and negative phototropic deformation are obtained concomitantly with synchronized but flexibly tunable multicolor changes upon light illumination and demonstrated the ingenious application of biomimetic actuation, encryption, and camouflage by the rational combination of these two systems. This work represents an innovative molecular design strategy for developing bioinspired materials with synchronized functions via a single compound.

         <title>Recent Advances in Scalable, High&#8208;Mass Loaded Electrodes for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increased reliance on renewable energy requires enhanced grid&#8208;scale energy storage. The subject of this review, the high mass loading of electrodes, is critical for determining manufacturing costs. Several of the reviewed fabrication techniques surpass the mass loading of conventional electrodes and achieve values above 100&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. These results represent an important step towards meeting future demands for grid storage.








Abstract
The increasing electrification of daily life as well as the intermittent characteristic of renewable energy sources require viable solutions for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Critical considerations for grid storage applications are electrode mass loading and electrode thickness as these features govern battery pack energy density, an important factor in determining manufacturing costs. For this reason, there is increased interest in finding new ways of creating electrodes with high mass loading. In this review, various high&#8208;mass loading fabrication approaches are considered for positive electrode materials used in batteries. The benchmark used for high mass loading is above 20&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is higher than the practical limit of conventional tape&#8208;cast electrodes. Several different electrode approaches are described including templating, laser patterning, direct ink writing, and electrodeposition.

     alt="Recent Advances in Scalable, High-Mass Loaded Electrodes for Grid-Scale Energy Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased reliance on renewable energy requires enhanced grid-scale energy storage. The subject of this review, the high mass loading of electrodes, is critical for determining manufacturing costs. Several of the reviewed fabrication techniques surpass the mass loading of conventional electrodes and achieve values above 100&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These results represent an important step towards meeting future demands for grid storage.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing electrification of daily life as well as the intermittent characteristic of renewable energy sources require viable solutions for grid-scale energy storage. Critical considerations for grid storage applications are electrode mass loading and electrode thickness as these features govern battery pack energy density, an important factor in determining manufacturing costs. For this reason, there is increased interest in finding new ways of creating electrodes with high mass loading. In this review, various high-mass loading fabrication approaches are considered for positive electrode materials used in batteries. The benchmark used for high mass loading is above 20&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is higher than the practical limit of conventional tape-cast electrodes. Several different electrode approaches are described including templating, laser patterning, direct ink writing, and electrodeposition. A variety of materials are covered with the most prominent being LiFe(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) (LFP), LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(LCO), and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In research to date, scalable electrochemical performance has been achieved with mass loadings over 100&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Areal capacities as high as 14.7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.82&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; have been achieved in non-aqueous electrolytes and 9.8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>MAPbBr3 Quantum Dots Encapsulated Within Lanthanide&#8208;MOFs for Time&#8208;Resolved Multicolor Dynamic Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting are achieved by utilizing the quantum&#8208;confinement effect of MAPbBr3 QDs within the MOFs. This unique anticounterfeiting tag enables high PL intensity and visible recognition to the naked eye and allows for multiple authentications in both time and space dimensions. These results provide valuable insights for designing high&#8208;security, high&#8208;intensity multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting tags.








Abstract
Multicolor dynamic optical materials exhibit significant potential in the realms of anticounterfeiting and information encryption, benefitting from their capacity for generating unpredictable optical information that changes over time. Herein, a novel approach is presented utilizing quantum&#8208;confinement effect of MAPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) embedded within lanthanide&#8208;metal organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) for time&#8208;resolved multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting applications. The dimensions of MAPbBr3 QDs undergo temporal variations during in situ growth, resulting in dynamic alterations in luminescent color due to the quantum&#8208;confinement effect. Furthermore, the emission colors of MAPbBr3@Eu&#8208;MOFs can be modulated by varying UV excitation wavelengths, thereby conferring a spatially distinguishable anticounterfeiting dimension. The time&#8208;resolved unpredictability of these dynamic color changes coupled with sustained luminescent intensity and multi&#8208;dimensional anticounterfeiting, render them suitable system for advanced graphical coding. These findings pave the way for the advancement of intelligent multicolor dynamic optical anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Anomalous Nonlinear Magnetoconductivity in van der Waals Magnet CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous nonlinear magnetoconductivity (NLMC) is demonstrated by manipulating internal magnetic orders in van der Waals magnet CrSBr interfaced by hBN layer. The anomalous NLMC presents multiple resistance states governed by both magnetization vector and N&#233;el vector utilizing the metamagnetic transition of CrSBr. This anomalous NLMC of the engineered CrSBr system promises efficient electrical readout of multiple magnetic information.








Abstract
Nonlinear magnetoconductivity (NLMC) is a nonreciprocal transport response arising in non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials. However, this ordinary NLMC signal vanishes at zero magnetic field, limiting its potential for applications. Here, the observation of an anomalous NLMC controlled by internal order parameters such as the magnetization or N&#233;el vectors is reported. This response is achieved by breaking both inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetry in artificial van der Waals heterostructures based on the magnetic CrSBr and insulating hBN. The nonreciprocal signal can be tuned between two different states in ferromagnetic monolayer CrSBr and among four different states in antiferromagnetic bilayer CrSBr, thanks to its metamagnetic transition. Remarkably, this output signal in the ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) state of CrSBr is three (one) orders of magnitude higher than those previously measured. A conductivity scaling analysis reveals the Berry connection polarizability as the origin of the anomalous NLMC. The results pave the way for high&#8208;frequency rectifiers with magnetically switchable output polarity as well as for an efficient electrical readout of the magnetic state of antiferromagnetic materials.

         <title>Morphogenic Growth 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
I additive manufacturing process exploits the spatial propagation of a polymerization reaction front to produce 3D polymer parts 10&#215; faster and 1000&#215; more energy efficient &#160;than the fastest stereolithography. In contrast with existing 3D printing, this morphogenic process is inspired by biological &#8220;growth and form&#8221; due to the self&#8208;directed propagation of the reaction.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's morphogenesis, a new 3D printing process &#8211;growth printing (GP)&#8211; takes advantage of a self&#8208;propagating curing front to produce 3D polymeric parts following a growth&#8208;like development plan. The propagation of the curing front is driven by the exothermic polymerization of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), which transforms the liquid resin into a stiff polymer as it propagates at 1 mm s&#8722;1. GP is triggered when a heated initiator contacts the uncured liquid resin in an open container. The initiator nucleates the frontal polymerization reaction and the isotropic radial propagation of the growth front. Simultaneously, the initiator is moved up across the free surface of the resin, pulling the cured object out of the uncured resin. The motion trajectory of the initiator with respect to the free resin surface controls the growth morphology of the 3D part. An inverse design algorithm is developed to produce 3D parts by modeling the reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;driven solidification process. This process has substantial energy savings and high printing&#160;speeds.

         <title>Mobile Oxygen Capture Enhances Photothermal Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells Under ISOS Protocols</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SnO2/ZnSb2O6&#8208;x double electron transport layer promotes a highly ordered arrangement of the perovskite lattice, improving film quality and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination, which in turn enhances carrier transport and overall device performance. Under photothermal conditions, ZnSb2O6&#8208;x effectively captures oxygen atoms at the SnO2 interface, preventing ion migration and thereby enhancing the photothermal operational stability of PSCs.








Abstract
Stability testing protocols from the International Summit on Organic and Hybrid Solar Cell Stability (ISOS) are essential for standardizing studies on the photothermally operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Under photothermal conditions, the migration of oxygen from SnO2 layer induces cationic dehydrogenation at the A&#8208;site of the perovskite, accelerating degradation to PbI2. This leads to the formation of photoinduced I2 and Pb0 defects, significantly compromising long&#8208;term stability. In this study, ordonezite (ZnSb2O6&#8208;x) as a multifunctional electron transport layer (ETL) that captures migrating oxygen atoms at the SnO2/perovskite interface is introduced, effectively preventing degradation of the buried interface. Additionally, the lattice match between ZnSb2O6&#8208;x and perovskite facilitates well&#8208;ordered perovskite film growth. As a result, PSCs featuring ZnSb2O6&#8208;x ETLs achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 25.02% and retained 90.62% of their initial performance after 1000&#160;h under the ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2 protocol. Furthermore, devices demonstrated remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 83.69% of their original performance after 800&#160;h of maximum power point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C, meeting the stringent ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol requirements.

This work introduces a programmable photonic analog&#8208;to&#8208;digital converter (ADC), leveraging phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) and foundry&#8208;based silicon photonics. 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;bit ADCs with zero quantization energy are achieved by the programmable and non&#8208;volatile nature of PCMs. The photonic ADC can reach a resolution of 8&#8208;bit with 65&#8208;state PCMs. An all&#8208;optical analog&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversion is successfully demonstrated, marking a significant advancement in efficient high&#8208;speed photonic processing.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance signal processing and telecommunication systems absolutely necessitate analog&#8208;to&#8208;digital converters (ADCs) that offer extensive bandwidth, exceptional precision, and minimal power consumption, in order to efficiently convert real&#8208;world analog signals into digital signals. While current electronic ADCs are constrained by limitations such as low bandwidth, high jitter noise, susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, and excessive energy consumption, photonic ADCs&#160;present&#160;promising solutions to overcome these challenges. Here, a programmable photonic ADC is developed by integrating phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) with silicon photonics fabricated using foundry processes. Thanks to the programmability and non&#8208;volatile nature of PCMs, 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;bit photonic ADCs are demonstrated on a single chip, achieving zero energy consumption during the quantization. Through the experimental demonstration of 65&#8208;state PCMs, photonic ADCs can attain a resolution of 8&#8208;bit, marking a significant milestone as the highest resolution reported to date for ADCs leveraging optical technologies. As a proof of concept, an all&#8208;optical analog&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversion system is demonstrated by integrating 2&#8208;bit photonic ADCs with optical sampling using a mode&#8208;locked laser (MLL). This system achieves&#160;the&#160;conversion of a 321&#160;MHz radio frequency (RF) signal at a sampling rate of 40 MS&#160;s&#8722;1. The programmable, energy&#8208;efficient, and high&#8208;speed photonic ADCs represent a significant advancement in the evolution of signal processing systems.

         <title>Terahertz Spin&#8208;to&#8208;Charge Conversion in Strontium Iridate&#8208;Based Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel system for next&#8208;generation spintronic THz emitting sources based on 5d oxides that operate at room temperature. By interfacing a SrIrO3 epitaxial film with ultra&#8208;thin ferromagnetic materials and using femtosecond spin injection THz emission spectroscopy, this system confirms the generation of electromagnetic waves at the THz frequency.








Abstract
Oxide interfaces have enormous potential for future electronics with many applications, such as large spin Hall conductance, phase transitions, topological states, and superconductivity. However, previous investigations have predominantly focused on gigahertz frequencies; whilst the possibilities to fabricate devices operational at terahertz frequencies are demonstrated. A model solution is proposed employing 5d rare&#8208;earth, strontium iridate (SrIrO3) heterostructure with cobalt (Co) ultrathin layers. Femtosecond lasers are used to photoexcite the spins in Co, which super diffuse into the SrIrO3 layer to produce an ultrafast inverse spin Hall effect in sub&#8208;picosecond timescales. The devices exploit the external magnetic field and laser fluence to control the spin polarization from the Co layer and demonstrate a tailored spin Hall effect. These results thus pave paths for next&#8208;generation ultrafast oxide electronics offering possibilities for room temperature&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Simultaneous AoLP and DoLP Detection in a Bias&#8208;Switchable PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 Heterojunction for Polarization Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 vdWH heterostructure polarized photodetector is introduced, which possesses the capability to simultaneously measure both the linear polarization angle and the degree of polarization. This device demonstrates bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection over a wide spectral range, and exhibits a bipolar photoresponse even at zero bias. Taking advantage of these unique properties, the photodetector has been successfully applied in imaging scenarios and has also been simulated for use in dual coding communication.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip polarized photodetectors play a crucial role in advancing ultra&#8208;compact optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation technologies. However, simultaneously detecting the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) and the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) within a single device remains a challenging task, particularly due to the inherently weak polarization states found in naturally anisotropic materials. In this paper, it is reported on the development of a twisted monopole barrier photodetector based on a PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 configuration. This photodetector features a rapid response time of 7&#8211;12&#160;&#181;s. In an imaging demonstration, it operates as a single&#8208;polarization photodetector, reconstructing AoLP and DoLP distributions of target objects through bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection across a wide spectral range, all without the plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures or polarization filters. Additionally, it demonstrates bipolar characteristics under zero&#8208;bias conditions at room temperature, enabling dual&#8208;binary coding for polarimetric&#8208;encoded communication. These combination of features positions the photodetector as a highly promising candidate for on&#8208;chip applications.

         <title>Toward Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Current Status of Functional Binders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an effective strategy to address the key scientific issues and enhance the electrochemical performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, the summary of the latest research advances aims to stimulate the exploration of innovative binders in the future and to contribute to the realization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their high energy density and enhanced safety. Binder plays an irreplaceable role in stabilizing the electrode structure, enhancing carrier transport and modulating solid electrolyte interfaces by connecting each component of the electrode. The development of functional binders is seen as a key strategy to achieve higher energy densities of ASSBs. This review systematically examines recent progress in binder development, focusing on their roles, impacts, and failure mechanisms in ASSBs. It begins by outlining the specific functionalities required of binders in ASSBs and provides a comprehensive summary of their applications across different components, including the anode, cathode, and solid electrolyte. Furthermore, the review highlights innovative binder design principles while also summarizing key testing methods and advanced characterization techniques for evaluating binder performance. This review proposes future directions for binder design based on current developments and emerging technologies, with the aim of creating optimal binder systems for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density applications.

         <title>Remolding the Interface Stability for Practical Aqueous Zn/I2 Batteries via Sulfonic Acid&#8208;Rich Electrolyte and Separator Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of the electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface plays a crucial role in aqueous Zn/I2 batteries and is largely determined by the properties of the electrolyte and separator. Herein, a sulfonic acid&#8208;rich electrolyte additive and separator are designed to suppress the shuttling effect and side reactions, and the electrolyte additive and separator impact the interface stability of Zn/I2 batteries is investigated.








Abstract
The electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface plays a crucial role in aqueous Zn/I2 battery and is largely determined by the properties of electrolyte and separator. Here, the synergistic effect of sulfonic acid&#8208;rich electrolyte additive and separator impacts the interface stability of Zn/I2 batteries is comprehensively investigated using operando synchrotron&#8208;based Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, and in situ spectroscopy. As a case study, a cost&#8208;effective additive known as lignosulfonic acid sodium (LAS) and a flexible sulfonated polyether sulfone membrane are employed to facilitate the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the Zn anode and effectively suppress the shuttle effect. The chemisorption of LAS on Zn, its interaction with Zn2+, and the impact on the Zn desolvation process are systematically investigated through both theoretical simulations and operando measurements. Furthermore, the formation of an in situ SEI consisting of ZnS and ZnF2 is identified, which facilitates the uniform nucleation and planar plating of Zn(002), while effectively suppressing detrimental side reactions. Additionally, visualization experiments and in situ spectroscopy confirm that R&#8722;SO3&#8722; groups effectively impede the shuttle process of I3&#8722;/I5&#8722; anions through electrostatic repulsion. This work provides valuable insights for designing robust electrolyte interfaces for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn/I2 batteries.

         <title>Superconductivity in PrNiO2 Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a superconducting state in undoped parent compound PrNiO2 thin films, challenging previous views on nickelate superconductivity. Through scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques, the research demonstrates the high structural quality and distinct electronic properties of the thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. While requiring an independent verification, this result suggests that the self&#8208;doping mechanism is sufficient for superconductivity and the reported phase diagram of infinite&#8208;layer nickelates might need a revision.








Abstract
Several reports about infinite&#8208;layer nickelate thin films suggest that the superconducting critical temperature versus chemical doping phase diagram has a dome&#8208;like shape, similar to cuprates. Here, a highly reproducible superconducting state in undoped PrNiO2 thin films grown on SrTiO3 are demonstrated. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements show coherent infinite&#8208;layer phase with no visible stacking&#8208;fault defects, an overall high structural quality where possible unintentional chemical doping or interstitial oxygen, if present, sum well below the measurable threshold of the technique. X&#8208;ray absorption measurements show very sharp features at the Ni L3,2&#8208;edges with a large linear dichroism, indicating the preferential hole occupation of Ni1+&#8208;3dx2&#8722;y2${\rm d}_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in a square planar geometry. Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal sharp magnon excitations of 200&#160;meV energy at the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, highly resonant at the Ni1 + absorption peak. The results indicate that, when properly stabilized, infinite&#8208;layer nickelate thin films are superconducting without chemical&#160;doping.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence and Multiscale Modeling for Sustainable Biopolymers and Bioinspired Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the multiscale architectures and functional mechanisms of biopolymers and bioinspired materials, from hierarchical structures to AI&#8208;powered methodologies. It covers sustainable configurations, multiscale modeling techniques, and AI applications for enhancing functionality, biodegradability, and design. The work concludes with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on biopolymer advancements and potential for broad lifecycle impacts in advanced material manufacturing.








Abstract
Biopolymers and bioinspired materials contribute to the construction of intricate hierarchical structures that exhibit advanced properties. The remarkable toughness and damage tolerance of such multilevel materials are conferred through the hierarchical assembly of their multiscale (i.e., atomistic to macroscale) components and architectures. Here, the functionality and mechanisms of biopolymers and bio&#8208;inspired materials at multilength scales are explored and summarized, focusing on biopolymer nanofibril configurations, biocompatible synthetic biopolymers, and bio&#8208;inspired composites. Their modeling methods with theoretical basis at multiple lengths and time scales are reviewed for biopolymer applications. Additionally, the exploration of artificial intelligence&#8208;powered methodologies is emphasized to realize improvements in these biopolymers from functionality, biodegradability, and sustainability to their characterization, fabrication process, and superior designs. Ultimately, a promising future for these versatile materials in the manufacturing of advanced materials across wider applications and greater lifecycle impacts is foreseen.

         <dc:description>
This work presents a synergistic strategy that utilizes bidentate chelating diethyldithiocarbamate as surface ligands for cadmium&#8208;free quantum dots (QDs), which enhances the ligand binding on the QD surface and improves stress dissipation under bending. Consequently, the resulting flexible devices exhibit peak external quantum efficiencies above 15% and retain over 90% of their initial performance after 5000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible light&#8208;emitting diodes utilizing environmentally friendly cadmium (Cd)&#8208;free quantum dots (QDs) hold immense potential for next&#8208;generation wearable integrated displays. However, their overall performance lags behind Cd&#8208;based counterparts, and less research focuses on the suitability of QD layers in flexible devices. Herein, it is observed that the traditional surface oleate ligands on QDs readily detach under device operation after cycling bending, leading to increased surface defects and accumulated tensile stress in QDs layers, further diminishing their photoluminescence and electroluminescence performance. Based on these insights, a synergetic regulation strategy is developed employing a short&#8208;chain bidentate chelating ligand, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), to strengthen the binding of QDs with ligands, minimizing ligand detaching and consequently inhibiting the non&#8208;radiative recombination of QDs; Meanwhile, the short&#8208;chain DDTC also reduces the inter&#8208;dot spatial distance and decreases the Young's modulus in QDs films, effectively dissipating stress localization and retaining the film morphology upon bending. Consequently, the resulting flexible devices based on blue ZnSeTe/ZnSe/ZnS QDs and green/red InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs demonstrate the peak external quantum efficiencies of above 15% and maintain over 90% after 5000 bending cycles, rivaling state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cd&#8208;based flexible devices.

         <title>Ephaptic Coupling in Ultralow&#8208;Power Ion&#8208;Gel Nanofiber Artificial Synapses for Enhanced Working Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible ionic synaptic device is developed to replicate the brain's ion transport and ephaptic coupling mechanisms, enabling efficient energy consumption and complex connectivity. By using ions for signal transmission, the device achieves spatiotemporal signal integration, mimicking the computational capabilities of biological neural networks. This work advances the development of brain&#8208;like AI systems with enhanced connectivity and processing efficiency.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices are designed to&#160;replicate the energy&#8208;efficient information processing advantages found in biological neural networks by emulating the working mechanisms of neurons and synapses. However, most existing neuromorphic devices focus primarily on functionally mimicking biological synapses, with insufficient emphasis on ion transport mechanisms. This limitation makes it challenging to achieve the complexity and connectivity inherent in biological systems, such as ephaptic coupling. Here, an ionic biomimetic synaptic device based on a flexible ion&#8208;gel nanofiber network is proposed, which transmits information and enables ephaptic coupling through capacitance formation by ion transport with an extremely low energy consumption of just 6 femtojoules. The hysteretic ion transport behavior endows the device with synaptic&#8208;like memory effects, significantly enhancing the performance of the reservoir computing system for classifying the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and demonstrating high efficiency in edge learning. More importantly, the devices in an array establish communication connections, exhibiting global oscillatory behaviors similar to ephaptic coupling in biological neural networks. This connectivity enables the array to perform working memory tasks, paving the way for developing brain&#8208;like systems characterized by high complexity and vast connectivity.

Here, an ionic biomimetic synaptic device based on a flexible ion-gel nanofiber network is proposed, which transmits information and enables ephaptic coupling through capacitance formation by ion transport with an extremely low energy consumption of just 6 femtojoules. The hysteretic ion transport behavior endows the device with synaptic-like memory effects, significantly enhancing the performance of the reservoir computing system for classifying the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and demonstrating high efficiency in edge learning. More importantly, the devices in an array establish communication connections, exhibiting global oscillatory behaviors similar to ephaptic coupling in biological neural networks. This connectivity enables the array to perform working memory tasks, paving the way for developing brain-like systems characterized by high complexity and vast connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Modulated Perovskite Quantum Emitters via Surface&#8208;Enhanced Landau Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 570 meV emission shift is achieved through surface&#8208;enhanced Landau damping during phase transitions. In crystalline Sb&#8322;Te&#8323;, localized surface plasmons facilitate hot&#8208;electron injection, shifting the emission energy from 1.64 to 2.21 eV. This tunability is further enhanced by applying a DC voltage bias, making it suitable for integration with on&#8208;chip quantum photonic systems.








Abstract
Tuning quantum emission to a specific wavelength at room temperature holds significant promise for enhancing secure quantum communication, particularly by aligning with the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum. The integration of quantum emitters with phase&#8208;change materials enables emission wavelength modulation, especially when strong field enhancement is present. Antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) exhibits the potential to facilitate this functionality through its support of interband plasmonics and phase&#8208;change behavior. In this study, Sb&#8322;Te&#8323; antennae are designed and fabricated to tune the emission energy of adjacent perovskite quantum dots (QDs) by over 570 meV. The underlying mechanism involves the localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on Sb&#8322;Te&#8323; nanostructures, which exhibit a surface&#8208;enhanced Landau damping process that facilitates the decay of LSPs into electron&#8208;hole pairs. The generated hot electrons are then injected into perovskite QDs via the microscopic electron transport process, which can be triggered by the transition of Sb2Te3 from amorphous to a crystalline state, resulting in a significant emission energy shift from 1.64 to 2.21&#160;eV. Furthermore, the emission energy of perovskite QDs on crystalline Sb&#8322;Te&#8323; nanoantennae can be modulated through DC voltage bias, highlighting the potential for extensive wavelength tunability of quantum emitters integrated with electronic systems.

         <title>Multifunctional Terahertz Biodetection Enabled by Resonant Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Testing diverse biomolecules and observing their dynamic interaction in complex biological systems in a label&#8208;free manner is critically important for THz absorption spectroscopy. A compact and multifunctional THz plasmonic biosensing platform by leveraging multiple interfering resonances from quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum designed to noninvasively and in situ track the temporal evolution of molecules in multiple analyte systems is proposed.








Abstract
Testing diverse biomolecules and observing their dynamic interaction in complex biological systems in a label&#8208;free manner is critically important for terahertz (THz) absorption spectroscopy. However, traditionally employed micro/nanophotonic techniques suffer from a narrow operating resonance and strong absorption band interference from polar solutions preventing seriously reliable, on&#8208;demand biosensor integration. Here, a multifunctional THz plasmonic biosensing platform by leveraging multiple interfering resonances from quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum designed to noninvasively and in situ track the temporal evolution of molecules in multiple analyte systems, is proposed. In contrast to conventional microphotonic sensors, this platform demonstrates substantially broadband performance and reduced footprints, allowing for simultaneous detection of diverse molecular vibrant at multiple spectral points through robust near&#8208;field interactions. Furthermore, this sensor enables real&#8208;time analysis of amino acid absorption as water evaporates despite its strong overlapping absorption bands in the THz range. By utilizing the real&#8208;time format of the reflectance method to acquire a comprehensive spectro&#8208;temporal data collection, this approach supports developing a deep neural network to discriminate and predict the composition and proportion of multiple mixtures, obviating the need for frequency scanning or microfluidic devices. This approach offers innovative viewpoints for exploring biological processes and provides valuable tools for biological analysis.

Mechanical Metamaterial
In article number 2410865, Fei Pan, Yuli Chen, and co&#8208;workers propose an automatically on&#8208;demand reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial. Driven by the pre&#8208;established structure&#8208;performance relations, the metamaterial can automatically tune its building blocks' states using built&#8208;in actuators to match different target stress&#8208;strain curves in real time. This offers a new solution for the physical properties reprogramming of artificial systems.

Sapphire Machining Integrated with Superconducting Qubits
In article number 2411780, Connor D. Shelly and co&#8208;workers from OQC and the University of Southampton present the integration of machining of sapphire substrates with superconducting qubits and quantum processors. It is shown that this sapphire machining process is compatible with the production of high&#8208;coherence qubits whilst maintaining tight Josephson junction parameter spread. This work provides a route to further scaling of quantum processors on sapphire.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review meticulously outlines the main effects of elevated temperatures on performance for polymer dielectrics and summarizes core modification strategies, while discussing the reasons for the performance difference between lab research and practical application from large&#8208;scale preparation and device design. This review may serve as a roadmap for the research and development of polymer dielectrics for years to come.








Abstract
Film capacitors are widely used in advanced electrical and electronic systems. The temperature stability of polymer dielectrics plays a critical role in supporting their performance operation at elevated temperatures. For the last decade, the investigations for new polymer dielectrics with high energy storage performance at higher temperatures (&gt;200 &#176;C) have attracted much attention and numerous strategies have been employed. However, there is currently still a large gap between lab research and large&#8208;scale production. In this review, the main effects of high temperature on the dielectric properties are analyzed and core modification strategies are summarized. The scientific and technological reasons for the performance difference between lab research and practical application are also discussed. Further, several processes for large&#8208;scale film preparation and typical device structure design are reviewed. The current research and product launches pertaining of high&#8208;temperature film capacitors are also summarized. Conclusive insights and future perspectives are delineated to offer strategic direction for the ongoing and prospective innovation in polymer dielectric materials.

It also summarizes progress in integrating sensing, energy harvesting, energy storage, self&#8208;healing, and color response into soft actuators.








Abstract
Biological structures exhibit autonomous and intelligent behaviors, such as movement, perception, and responses to environmental changes, through dynamic interactions with their surroundings. Inspired by natural organisms, future soft robots are also advancing toward autonomy, sustainability, and interactivity. This review summarizes the latest achievements in untethered soft robots based on 1D and 2D nanomaterials. First, the performance of soft actuators designed with different structures is compared. Then, the development of basic locomotion forms, including crawling, jumping, swimming, rolling, gripping, and multimodal, mimicking biological motion mechanisms under dynamic stimuli, is discussed. Subsequently, various self&#8208;sustained movements based on imbalance mechanisms under static stimuli are introduced, including light tracking, self&#8208;oscillating, self&#8208;crawling, self&#8208;rolling, and flying. Following that, the progress in soft actuators integrated with additional functionalities such as sensing, energy harvesting, and storage is summarized. Finally, the challenges faced in this field and the prospects for future development are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the flexible bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems, classified into near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing, is addressed. Fundamental aspects, including biological processes, required components, and the device types for each component, as well as applications for wearable systems, are discussed. Additionally, perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics are provided.








Abstract
Flexible neuromorphic architectures that emulate biological cognitive systems hold great promise for smart wearable electronics. To realize neuro&#8208;inspired sensing and computing electronics, artificial sensory neurons that detect and process external stimuli must be integrated with central nervous systems capable of parallel computation. In near&#8208;sensor computing, synaptic devices, and sensors are used to emulate sensory neurons and receptors, respectively. In contrast, in in&#8208;sensor computing, a single multifunctional device serves as both the receptor and neuron. Bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems efficiently detect and process stimuli through data structuring techniques, significantly reducing data volume and enabling the extension of neuromorphic applications to smart wearable systems. To construct wearable near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing, it is crucial to develop artificial sensory neurons and central nervous synapses that replicate the biological functionalities. Additionally, the integrated systems must exhibit high mechanical flexibility and integration density. This review addresses research on flexible bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems, classified into near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing. It covers fundamental aspects, including biological cognitive processes, the required components, and the structures for each component, as well as applications for wearable smart systems. Finally, it offers perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics in smart wearable systems connected to the next&#8208;generation Internet of Things.

         <title>Destabilization of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Characterization, Mechanisms, and Regeneration Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), identifying five deactivation pathways across seven destabilization scenarios and detailing three key regeneration strategies. It introduces advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques relevant to these processes. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing stable and efficient SACs for energy applications.








Abstract
Numerous in situ characterization studies have focused on revealing the catalytic mechanisms of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), providing a theoretical basis for their rational design. Although research is relatively limited, the stability of SACs under long&#8208;term operating conditions is equally important and a prerequisite for their real&#8208;world energy applications, such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Recently, there has been a rise in in situ characterization studies on the destabilization and regeneration of SACs; however, timely and comprehensive summaries that provide the catalysis community with valuable insights and research directions are still lacking. This review summarizes recent advances in the destabilization mechanisms and regeneration strategies of SACs, specifically highlighting various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques employed in the studies. The factors that induce destabilization in SACs are identified by discussing the failure of active sites, coordination environments, supports, and reaction conditions under long&#8208;term operating scenarios. Next, the primary regeneration strategies for SACs are introduced, including redispersion, surface poison desorption, and exposure of subsurface active sites. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of both in situ and ex situ characterization techniques are discussed. Finally, future research directions are proposed, aimed at constructing structure&#8211;stability relationships and guiding the design of more stable SACs.

&lt;p&gt;This review provides a comprehensive overview of deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies for single-atom catalysts (SACs), identifying five deactivation pathways across seven destabilization scenarios and detailing three key regeneration strategies. It introduces advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques relevant to these processes. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing stable and efficient SACs for energy applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous in situ characterization studies have focused on revealing the catalytic mechanisms of single-atom catalysts (SACs), providing a theoretical basis for their rational design. Although research is relatively limited, the stability of SACs under long-term operating conditions is equally important and a prerequisite for their real-world energy applications, such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Recently, there has been a rise in in situ characterization studies on the destabilization and regeneration of SACs; however, timely and comprehensive summaries that provide the catalysis community with valuable insights and research directions are still lacking. This review summarizes recent advances in the destabilization mechanisms and regeneration strategies of SACs, specifically highlighting various state-of-the-art characterization techniques employed in the studies. The factors that induce destabilization in SACs are identified by discussing the failure of active sites, coordination environments, supports, and reaction conditions under long-term operating scenarios. Next, the primary regeneration strategies for SACs are introduced, including redispersion, surface poison desorption, and exposure of subsurface active sites. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of both in situ and ex situ characterization techniques are discussed. Finally, future research directions are proposed, aimed at constructing structure&#8211;stability relationships and guiding the design of more stable SACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal Complexes in Biomedical Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes are widely used in biomedical research due to their excellent properties. To further overcome the pharmacological limitations of metal complexes, the multifunctional nanomaterials are developed. This review introduces the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles of various shapes, the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly, and their applications in biomedical fields such as detection, imaging, and antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Cisplatin is widely used in clinical cancer treatment; however, its application is often hindered by severe side effects, particularly inherent or acquired resistance of target cells. To address these challenges, an effective strategy is to modify the metal core of the complex and introduce alternative coordination modes or valence states, leading to the development of a series of metal complexes, such as platinum (IV) prodrugs and cyclometalated complexes. Recent advances in nanotechnology have facilitated the development of multifunctional nanomaterials that can selectively deliver drugs to tumor cells, thereby overcoming the pharmacological limitations of metal&#8208;based drugs. This review first explores the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into spherical, linear, and irregular nanoparticles in the context of biomedical applications. The mechanisms underlying the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles are subsequently analyzed, followed by a discussion of their applications in biomedical fields, including detection, imaging, and antitumor research.

         <title>Advances in Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts via Direct Oxygen&#8211;Oxygen Radical Coupling Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts via the oxide path mechanism (OPM) is systematically reviewed. It sheds light on the rational design of OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts to break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;offs involved in conventional OER mechanisms, leading to more efficient energy conversion and storage processes, such as water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

A controllable &#8220;oxygen vehicle&#8221; as a versatile nano&#8208;carrier. For co&#8208;delivery with lactate oxidase (LOX) significantly elevated lactate detection rates, triggering a significantly increase in IFN&#8208;&#947; and T cell infiltration. Co&#8208;delivering unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligonucleotide &#65288;CpGODN&#65289; demonstrate a remarkable increase in polarization of macrophages from M2&#8208;like to M1&#8208;like phenotypes, DCs maturation, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia severely limits the antitumor immunotherapy for breast cancer. Although efforts to alleviate tumor hypoxia and drug delivery using diverse nanostructures achieve promising results, the creation of a versatile controllable oxygen&#8208;releasing nano&#8208;platform for co&#8208;delivery with immunostimulatory molecules remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, a versatile oxygen controllable releasing vehicle PFOB@F127@PDA (PFPNPs) is developed, which effectively co&#8208;delivered either protein drug lactate oxidase (LOX) or nucleic acids drug unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligonucleotide (CpG ODNs). Upon photothermal heating, this platform triggered oxygen release, thereby augmenting LOX&#8208;mediated lactate detection rates, and improving T cells infiltrating and cytokine expression. Moreover, under an oxygenated tumor microenvironment (TME), PFPNPs co&#8208;delivered with CpG ODNs effectively reprogrammed the immunosuppressive TME by repolarizing macrophages to an M1&#8208;like phenotype, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and increasing tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells while decreasing the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Our study demonstrated that this controlled oxygen&#8208;releasing platform possessed adaptive drug&#8208;loading capabilities to meet varied immunotherapeutic demands in clinical settings.

         <title>Microenvironment Mechanical Torque from ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) Micromotors Inhibiting Tumor Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble in situ effectively and introduce mechanical force simulating primary biomechanical into the tiny target spot of TME through wireless magnetic control, which effectively inhibits tumor migration.








Abstract
Mechanical force attracts booming attention with the potential to tune the tumor cell behavior, especially in cell migration. However, the current approach for introducing mechanical input is difficult to apply in vivo. How the mechanical force affects cell behavior in situ also remains unclear. In this work, an intelligent miniaturized platform is constructed with magnetic ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) micromotors. The wireless ZFO can self&#8208;assemble in situ and rotate to generate mechanical torque of biologically relevant piconewton&#8208;scale at the target tumor site. It is observed unexpectedly that enhanced in situ mechanical rotating torque from ZFO micromotors and the active fluid inhibit the migration of highly invasive A549 tumor cells. The down&#8208;regulation of the Piezo1 channel and the suppressed signaling of ROCK1 in mechano&#8208;adaptive tumor cells is found to be related to the inhibition effect. With effectiveness confirmed with the zebrafish xenograft model, this platform provides a valuable toolkit for mechanobiology and force&#8208;associated non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapidly and on&#8208;demand reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial with an embedded digital interface to its structure&#8208;performance relationships is proposed. For a given stress&#8211;strain curve, the optimal state can first be calculated based on pre&#8208;established structure&#8208;performance relationships. Subsequently, the state of the metamaterial can be changed using integrated soft actuators, enabling accurate and fast performance reprogramming.








Abstract
The physical reprogrammability of metamaterials provides unprecedented opportunities for tailoring changeable mechanical behaviors. It is envisioned that metamaterials can actively, precisely, and rapidly reprogram their performances through digital interfaces toward varying demands. However, on&#8208;demand reprogramming by integration of physical and digital merits still remains less explored. Here, a real&#8208;time reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial is reported that is guided by its own structure&#8208;performance relations. The metamaterial consists of periodically tessellated bistable building blocks with built&#8208;in soft actuators for state switching, exhibiting rich spatial heterogeneity. Guided by the pre&#8208;established relations between state sequences and stress&#8211;strain curves, the metamaterial can accurately match a target curve by digitally tuning its state within 4 s. The metamaterial can be elastically tensioned and compressed under a strain of 4%, and its modulus tuning ratio reaches &gt;30. Moreover, it also shows highly tunable shearing and bending performances. This work provides a new thought for the physical performance reprogrammability of artificial intelligent systems.

         <title>Integration of Through&#8208;Sapphire Substrate Machining with Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;sapphire machining is integrated with superconducting quantum processors (QPUs) and qubits. High coherence of the qubits is demonstrated as well as low parameter spread. This machining integration provides a route to further scaling of QPUs on new materials such as tantalum that are typically deposited on sapphire substrates. In addition, the machining provides a route to through&#8208;sapphire&#8208;vias in superconducting circuits.








Abstract
A sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate&#8208;scale quantum processors is demonstrated. The process allows through&#8208;substrate electrical connections, necessary for low&#8208;frequency mode&#8208;mitigation, as well as signal&#8208;routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High&#8208;coherence qubits are required to build fault&#8208;tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low&#8208;loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high&#8208;coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium&#8208;nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep&#8208;silicon etching to create through&#8208;substrate&#8208;vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small&#8208;scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high&#8208;coherence qubits is presented. This technique immediately provides a means to scale quantum processing units (QPUs) with integrated mode&#8208;mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through&#8208;sapphire&#8208;vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire&#8208;compatible materials for large&#8208;scale&#160;QPUs.

         <title>Quantum Dot Luminescence Microspheres Enable Ultra&#8208;Efficient and Bright Micro&#8208;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green and red quantum dot (QD) luminescence microspheres with simultaneous excellent color conversion performance and high photoluminescence stability are synthesized by a facile wet chemical process. They further serve as color conversion materials for the fabrication of green and red micro&#8208;LEDs, which exhibit world&#8208;record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1% and high brightnesses of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;108 and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;107 cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Quantum dot (QD)&#8208;converted micrometer&#8208;scale light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs) are regarded as an effective solution for achieving high&#8208;performance full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED displays because of their narrow&#8208;band emission, simplified mass transfer, facile drive circuits, and low cost. However, these micro&#8208;LEDs suffer from significant blue light leakage and unsatisfactory electroluminescence properties due to the poor light conversion efficiency and stability of the QDs. Herein, the construction of green and red QD luminescence microspheres with the simultaneously high conversion efficiency of blue light and strong photoluminescence stability are proposed. These luminescence microspheres exhibit high external photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 46% under 450&#160;nm excitation, along with excellent reliability against blue light, heat, and water&#8208;oxygen degradation, owing to the waveguide and spatial confinement effects of the microspheres. The microsphere&#8208;based green and red micro&#8208;LEDs achieve world&#8208;record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1%, respectively, and high brightness values of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;108 and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively. Finally, 0.6&#160;inch red, green, and blue monochrome micro&#8208;LED displays are demonstrated by integrating microsphere&#8208;converted micro&#8208;LED arrays with thin&#8208;film transistor backplanes, which show a pixel resolution as high as 1700 PPI and brightness exceeding 10&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Stress Relaxation for Lead Iodide Nucleation in Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By inducing LiOTf in SnO2/ PbI2, the defects in bulk SnO2 and at the interface are passivated and stress in PbI2 is released, thus reducing the critical Gibbs free energy for mesoporous PbI2 films which leads to highly crystalline perovskite films. Ultimately, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a champion PCE of 25.33% are fabricated.








Abstract
Porous lead iodide (PbI2) film is crucial for the complete reaction between PbI2 and ammonium salts in sequential&#8208;deposition technology so as to achieve high crystallinity perovskite film. Herein, it is found that the tensile stress in tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) is a key factor influencing the morphology and crystallization of PbI2 films. Focusing on this, lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf) is used as an interfacial modifier in the SnO2/PbI2 interface to decrease the tensile stress to reduce the necessary critical Gibbs free energy for PbI2 nuclei formation. The relaxed tensile stress facilitates the more porous PbI2 generation with larger particles and higher roughness, resulting in superior&#8208;quality perovskite films. Besides, this strategy effectively passivates the inherent electron traps of SnO2 and smooths the interfacial energy levels, boosting the charge extraction and transfer. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.33% (25.10% stabilized for 600 s) is achieved. Furthermore, the device demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE at its maximum power point tracking measurement (under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 white light illumination at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C temperature, in N2 atmosphere) after 600 h.

         <title>A Universal Therapeutic Vaccine Leveraging Autologous Pre&#8208;Existing Immunity to Eliminate in Situ Uniformly Engineered Heterogeneous Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic vaccine overcomes immune evasion and resistance in diverse tumor cells by utilizing the highly immunogenic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD antigen, enhancing antigen presentation via SUSD6 shRNA, and silencing the immune checkpoint gene PD&#8208;L1 through shRNA. It further amplifies RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity with adjuvant&#8208;supported secretion of RBD&#8208;enveloped virus&#8208;like particles, achieving precise and effective eradication of engineered tumor cells.








Abstract
Tumor vaccines that activate the autologous immune system to eliminate tumor cells represent a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, limited antigen selection, insufficient antigen presentation, and the slow onset of de novo immune responses have resulted in poor universality and suboptimal response rates. In contrast, pathogen&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity acquired through infection or vaccination, can rapidly generate a more potent and enduring immune response upon re&#8208;encounter with the same antigen. Here, an adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV)&#8208;based therapeutic vaccine capable of genetically modifying diverse tumor cells to uniformly overexpress and efficiently present the highly immunogenic transmembrane SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and to release RBD&#8208;enveloped virus&#8208;like particles, which awaken and enhance the RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity, leading to significant tumor remission, is engineered. Mechanistically, this therapeutic vaccine leverages the robust RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity and heightened antibody&#8208;mediated phagocytosis to eliminate engineered tumor cells while inducing antigen spreading, thereby provoking a more diverse tumor&#8208;specific cellular immune responses. Notably, widespread administration of vaccines against various pathogens has provided a versatile pool of pre&#8208;existing immunity that can be redirected to eradicate tumors. These findings offer a novel perspective on overcoming the limitations posed by tumor heterogeneity and personalized medicine.

&lt;p&gt;The therapeutic vaccine overcomes immune evasion and resistance in diverse tumor cells by utilizing the highly immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen, enhancing antigen presentation via SUSD6 shRNA, and silencing the immune checkpoint gene PD-L1 through shRNA. It further amplifies RBD-specific pre-existing immunity with adjuvant-supported secretion of RBD-enveloped virus-like particles, achieving precise and effective eradication of engineered tumor cells.

         <title>Supercooled Liquids in a Core&#8211;Shell Coordination Structure for Practical Long&#8208;Term Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a unique metal&#8208;organic core&#8211;shell coordination structure, new supercooled liquid materials successfully achieve mutually phase&#8208;stability and controllable phase&#8208;transition in inherent contradictory, for practical long&#8208;term thermal energy storage.








Abstract
Mutual acquisition of phase&#8208;stability and controllable phase&#8208;transition becomes a predominant criterion of phase&#8208;change materials for the practical long&#8208;term energy storage but seems contradictory always. Here a strategy combining coordination and hydrogen bonds hierarchically to create a supercooled liquid in a core&#8211;shell coordination structure is reported, addressing that demand successfully. This new material is composed of a Mn&#8208;methylurea complex (MM) core and the hierarchically bonded erythritols shell. MM glass core with a viscosity of 108 Pa&#183;s determines its thermal phase&#8208;stability. As discovered, the ingenious ligand&#8208;exchange between erythritol and Cl&#8722; ion coordinated with MM core accounts for this effectively reversible phase&#8208;transition. This can be triggered by a small shear&#8208;stress of 10&#160;Pa within tens of seconds, exhibiting good practicability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of phase&#8208;transition are explored.

         <title>Buffer&#8208;Less Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a systematic method for the direct growth of GaN on six&#8208;inch silicon substrates without buffers, significantly reducing GaN&#8208;to&#8208;substrate thermal resistance while maintaining structural quality comparable to buffered approaches. As&#8208;grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this buffer&#8208;less platform demonstrate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D electron gas mobilities, paving the way for efficient III&#8208;nitride transistors and advancing fundamental research on electron dynamics.








Abstract
Thick metamorphic buffers are considered indispensable for III&#8208;V semiconductor heteroepitaxy on large lattice and thermal&#8208;expansion mismatched silicon substrates. However, III&#8208;nitride buffers in conventional GaN&#8208;on&#8208;Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) impose a substantial thermal resistance, deteriorating device efficiency and lifetime by throttling heat extraction. To circumvent this, a systematic methodology for the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on six&#8208;inch silicon substrates is demonstrated using metal&#8208;organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Crucial growth&#8208;stress modulation to prevent epilayer cracking is achieved even without buffers, and threading dislocation densities comparable to those in buffered structures are realized. The buffer&#8208;less design yields a GaN&#8208;to&#8208;substrate thermal resistance of (11 &#177; 4) m2&#160;K&#160;GW&#8722;1, an order of magnitude reduction over conventional GaN&#8208;on&#8208;Si and one of the lowest on any non&#8208;native substrate. As&#8208;grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this template show a high&#8208;quality 2D electron gas (2DEG) whose room&#8208;temperature Hall&#8208;effect mobility exceeds 2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, rivaling the best&#8208;reported values. As further validation, the low&#8208;temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov&#8208;de&#8208;Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime &gt; 0.180 ps, and tell&#8208;tale signatures of spin&#8208;splitting. These results could establish a new platform for III&#8208;nitrides, potentially enhancing the energy efficiency of power transistors and enabling fundamental investigations into electron dynamics in quasi&#8208;2D wide&#8208;bandgap systems.

         <title>In Situ, Treatment with Guanidinium Chloride Ligand Enables Efficient Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 23.5% External Quantum Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
Insufficient hole injection, excessive electron injection, and abundant defects on the surface of QDs are limiting the performance of blue QLEDs. An in situ patching strategy with GACl is proposed to simultaneously passivate surface defects and enhance hole injection, with the EQE increasing from 16.3% to 23.5%. The model is proposed to understand the physical mechanism of hole injection and transport.








Abstract
The poor efficiency and stability of blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting diodes (QLED) hinders the practical applications of QLEDs full&#8208;color displays. Excessive electron injection, insufficient hole injection, and abundant defects on the surface of quantum dots (QD) are the main issues limiting the performance of blue devices. Herein, an in situ treatment with bipolar small molecule polydentate ligand&#8211;guanidine chloride (GACl) is proposed to simultaneously suppress excessive electron injection, patch surface defects of QDs and enhance hole injection. GACl&#8208;treated blue QLEDs exhibited a remarkable increase in maximal external quantum Efficiency (EQE) from 16.3% to a record 23.5%, accompanied by maximal luminance (36810&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent maximal current efficiency (17.5&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1), and enhanced device stability. Combining C&#8211;V and J&#8211;V characteristics, a concise physical model of hole injection is also established: Below 3&#160;V, hole injection is controlled by the interfacial barrier, primarily through tunneling and thermionic injection; Above 3&#160;V, the interfacial barrier is eliminated, and hole injection efficiency is governed by transport within the QD layer. This study showed a clear physical model for understanding the hole injection mechanism in QLEDs, offering valuable design strategies for improving the performance of blue&#8208;QLEDs.

         <title>Fabricating Lattice&#8208;Confined Pt Single Atoms With High Electron&#8208;Deficient State for Alkali Hydrogen Evolution Under Industrial&#8208;Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;confined Pt1/Ni(OH)2 SACs with excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are constructed by a co&#8208;reduction strategy. Mechanism studies disclose the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during HER. Finally, this facile synthesis approach is extended to fabricate other 9 lattice&#8208;confined SACs.








Abstract
The confining effect is essential to regulate the activity and stability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), but the universal fabrication of confined SACs is still a great challenge. Here, various lattice&#8208;confined Pt SACs supported by different carriers are constructed by a universal co&#8208;reduction approach. Notably, Pt single atoms confined in the lattice of Ni(OH)2 (Pt1/Ni(OH)2) with a high electron&#8208;deficient state exhibit excellent activity for basic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 just requires 15&#160;mV to get 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and the mass activity of Pt1/Ni(OH)2 is 15 times of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 assembled in an alkaline water electrolyzer shows 1030&#160;h durability under the industrial current density of 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Lattice-confined Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SACs with excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are constructed by a co-reduction strategy. Mechanism studies disclose the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step during HER. Finally, this facile synthesis approach is extended to fabricate other 9 lattice-confined SACs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confining effect is essential to regulate the activity and stability of single-atom catalysts (SACs), but the universal fabrication of confined SACs is still a great challenge. Here, various lattice-confined Pt SACs supported by different carriers are constructed by a universal co-reduction approach. Notably, Pt single atoms confined in the lattice of Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with a high electron-deficient state exhibit excellent activity for basic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; just requires 15&#160;mV to get 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the mass activity of Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 15 times of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assembled in an alkaline water electrolyzer shows 1030&#160;h durability under the industrial current density of 800&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ spectroscopy techniques reveal Pt&#9472;H and &#8220;free&#8221; OH radical can be directly observed for Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, confirming the lattice-confined Pt single atoms play a key role during HER. Further density functional theory uncovers the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which quickly optimizes the electronic state of the Pt site, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step to 0.16&#160;eV for HER.

         <title>Crystallographic Spin Torque Conductivity Tensor of Epitaxial IrO2 Thin Films for Oxide Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries are determined for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 epitaxial thin films, via measurements of conventional anti&#8208;damping torques in the high&#8208;symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. Rotational transformations of this tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional torques for IrO2 in the lower&#8208;symmetry orientations, with good agreement.








Abstract
Unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torques arising from electric&#8208;field&#8208;generated spin currents in anisotropic materials have promising potential for spintronic applications, including for perpendicular magnetic switching in high&#8208;density memory applications. Here, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 are determined via measurements of conventional (in&#8208;plane) anti&#8208;damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the high&#8208;symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. It is then tested whether rotational transformations of this same tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional anti&#8208;damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the lower&#8208;symmetry (101), (110), and (111) orientations, finding good agreement. The results confirm that spin&#8208;orbit torques from all these orientations are consistent with the bulk symmetries of IrO2, and show how simple measurements of conventional torques from high&#8208;symmetry orientations of anisotropic thin films can provide an accurate prediction of the unconventional torques from lower&#8208;symmetry orientations.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Surface for Radiative Cooling Enhanced Power&#8208;Free Moisture Harvesting in Unsaturated Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Namib Pachydactylus Rangei, a Power&#8208;Free Cooling moisture harvester with Luneburg Lens Array is fabricated using Self&#8208;Developed &#956;&#8208;ECM process. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with Exceptional Passive sub&#8208;Dewpoint Cooling and Efficient Harvesting Performance. Installing every 1 m2 of PFCMH can Yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg per year of water and Save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh per year of electricity.








Abstract
The development of zero&#8208;power moisture&#8208;harvesting technology in an unsaturated atmosphere is of great significance for coping with global freshwater scarcity. Here, inspired by Pachydactylus rangei's&#160;(Namib sand gecko) ability to evade thermal radiation and harvest moisture, a power&#8208;free cooling moisture harvester (PFCMH) is fabricated using the continuous, industrialized micro&#8208;extrusion compression molding. A Luneburg lens is introduced in the PFCMH for the first time, endowing it with a high reflectivity of &#8776;92.9% in 0.3 to the 2.5&#160;&#181;m waveband and emissivity of &#8776;98.1% in 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m waveband, which are &#8776;19.2% and &#8776;15.4% higher than those of the unstructured radiative cooler, respectively. Consequently, a temperature reduction of &#8776;6.9 &#176;C is achieved. In addition, the wettability of PFCMH is well regulated, at a contact angle of &#8776;153&#176; and a rolling angle of &#8776;42&#176;, enabling its surface to efficiently nucleate and transport water droplets. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with exceptional passive sub&#8208;dewpoint cooling and efficient harvesting performance. Importantly, every 1 m2 of PFCMH can yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg year&#8722;1 of water and save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh year&#8722;1 of electricity. The PFCMH offers an environmentally, power&#8208;free, and promising solution to freshwater scarcity.

         <title>Directional Freeze&#8208;Casting Cryogel Loaded with Quaternized Chitosan Modified Gallium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Capture and Eradicate the Resistant Bacteria for Guided Regeneration in Infected Bone Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. This work reported a quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GaMOF), to capture the Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221; and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me). Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel (Me/QCSGa&#8208;MOF@Cryogel) is fabricated for combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. Its recurrent and resistant nature, high incidence rate, long&#8208;term hospitalization, and high medical costs have driven the efforts of the scientific community to develop new therapies to improve the situation. Considering the complex microenvironment and persistent mechanisms mediated by resistant bacteria, it is crucial to develop an implant with enhanced osseointegration and sustained and effective infection clearance effects. Here, a positively charged quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (GaMOF) is designed, to capture the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria (Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221;, and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me) via disturbing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel loaded with the Me and QCSGaMOF is fabricated by the directional freeze&#8208;casting method. The oriented porous structure has an enhanced osseointegration effect by guiding the ingrowth of osteogenic cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments prove the advantages of as&#8208;prepared Me/QCSGa&#8208;MOF@Cryogel in combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents the design and characterization of first molecular ferroelectric Mott insulator, (C7H14N)3V12O30. Accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 shows a sharp change in conductivity, implying the metal&#8211;insulator transition&#8208;like behavior. This finding opened up new possibilities for the development of strongly correlated electron systems.








Abstract
With the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance materials and high&#8208;temperature superconductors, Mott insulators can potentially undergo a transition from insulating state to metallic state. Here, in molecular ferroelectrics system, a Mott insulator of (C7H14N)3V12O30 has been first synthesized, which is a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic ferroelectric with composition of layered vanadium oxide and quinuclidine ring. Interestingly, accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 changes sharply in conductivity. The occurrence of a Mott transition has been proven by electric transport measurements and theoretical calculations. This research has significantly expanded the applicative horizons of ferroelectric materials, and offering an ideal platform for the investigation of strongly correlated electron systems.

         <title>Synergistic Adhesion and Shape Deformation in Nanowire&#8208;Structured Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer films with dense nanowire arrays exhibit synergistic adhesion and shape&#8208;changing properties. They curl toward the nanowire side under heat or chemical vapors but away from it with liquid droplets. Chemical modifications make them superoleophobic underwater, enabling precise droplet manipulation. This biomimetic design integrates enhanced adhesion with stimuli&#8208;responsive deformation, with promising applications in soft robotics and adaptive surfaces.








Abstract
Nature provides many examples of the benefits of nanoscopic surface structures in areas of adhesion and antifouling. Herein, the design, fabrication, and characterization of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films are presented with nanowire surface structures that exhibit tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive deformations and enhanced adhesion properties. The LCE films are shown to curl toward the side with the nanowires when stimulated by heat or organic solvent vapors. In contrast, when a droplet of the same solvent is placed on the film, it curls away from the nanowire side due to nanowire&#8208;induced capillary forces that cause unequal swelling. This characteristic curling deformation is shown to be reversible and can be optimized to match curved substrates, maximizing adhesive shear forces. By using chemical modification, the LCE nanowire films can be given underwater superoleophobicity, enabling oil repellency under a range of harsh conditions. This is combined with the nanowire&#8208;induced frictional asymmetry and the reversible shape deformation to create an underwater droplet mixing robot, capable of performing chemical reactions in aqueous environments. These findings demonstrate the potential of nanowire&#8208;augmented LCE films for advanced applications in soft robotics, adaptive adhesion, and easy chemical modification, with implications for designing responsive materials that integrate mechanical flexibility with surface functionality.

         <title>Creating Single Atomic Coordination for Hypoxia&#8208;Resistant Pyroptosis Nano&#8208;Inducer to Boost Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) that inherit the single atomic Fe&#8211;N4 center of hemin while creating sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon surroundings were created by a simple solvothermal treatment of hemin. HNCDs synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I, thus can significantly induce tumor pyroptosis and evoke strong antitumor immune response even under hypoxic environment.









Abstract
General synthesis and mechanical understanding of type I nano&#8208;photosensitizers are of great importance for hypoxia&#8208;resistant pyroptosis inducers. Herein, a simple solvothermal treatment is developed to convert non&#8208;photosensitive small molecules (hemin) into uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) with strong type I photodynamic activity and red fluorescence emission. These HNCDs inherit the single atomic Fe&#8211;N4 center of hemin while creating sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon surroundings, which synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I. After encapsulating HNCDs with bovine serum albumin (BSA)&#160;to facilitate in vivo applications, the resulting BSA nanoparticles (HB) can image tumors and significantly induce the pyroptosis of tumor cells even under an extremely hypoxic environment (2% O2). This evokes a strong antitumor immune response, effectively restraining tumor growth and lung metastasis in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer mice, with good biocompatibility. This work introduces an applicable pyroptosis nano&#8208;inducer to combat hypoxic tumors and highlights the regulation of Fe&#8211;N4 centers to develop hypoxia&#8208;resistant type I nano&#8208;photosensitizers for cancer treatment.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Induced Nonreciprocal Directional Dichroism in a Time&#8208;Reversal&#8208;Odd Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric field&#8208;induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E&#8208;induced NDD) ascribed to the diagonal electrotoroidic effect is discovered in a time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd antiferromagnet Co&#8322;SiO&#8324; possessing a time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Spatial distribution measurements of E&#8208;induced NDD reveal domain structures. Magnetic field&#8208;induced domain inversion mediated by the piezomagnetic effect highlights the rich physics of time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with broken time&#8208;reversal (T$\mathcal{T}$) symmetry (T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet&#8208;like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet&#8208;like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T$\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in such a system, a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field&#8208;induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E&#8208;induced NDD), is employed. Signals of E&#8208;induced NDD are successfully detected in a T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnet, Co&#8322;SiO&#8324;, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E&#8208;induced NDD, spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T$\mathcal{T}$ operation are visualized. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. The observation of E&#8208;induced NDD highlights unique functionalities of T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets.

         <title>High&#8208;Modulus Homochiral Torsional Oxide Ceramic Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;modulus homochiral Al2O3 yarn artificial muscles with a different actuation mechanism containing volume expansion and topological structure transformation are fabricated. Under an electric drive, the torsional muscle provides a high actuation stress of 483.5 MPa, a large energy density of 9.8 J&#160;g&#8722;1, and a high output power of 10.3 W&#160;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a large stroke of 13.5%.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;based artificial muscles are soft actuators used to mimic the movement of human muscles. However, using high modulus oxide ceramics to fabricate artificial muscles with high energy and power is a challenge as they are prone to brittle fracture during torsion. Here, a ceramic metallization strategy is reported that solves the problem of low torsion and low ductility of alumina (Al2O3) ceramics by chemical plating a thin copper layer on alumina filaments. These filaments with a high modulus of &#8776;180&#160;GPa can be twisted into chiral coiled artificial muscles, exhibiting a unique electric thermal actuation mechanism. This tough and robust alumina artificial muscle can carry objects equivalent to 0.28 million times its weight and provide high actuation stress of up to 483.5&#160;MPa. In addition, it exhibits 18 times higher contraction power and 240 times higher energy density than human muscles, as well as a high energy conversion efficiency of up to 7.59%, which far exceeds most reported actuated carbon and polymer artificial muscles. This work has achieved large&#8208;scale manufacturing of high&#8208;modulus oxide ceramic muscles for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;High-modulus homochiral Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yarn artificial muscles with a different actuation mechanism containing volume expansion and topological structure transformation are fabricated. Under an electric drive, the torsional muscle provides a high actuation stress of 483.5 MPa, a large energy density of 9.8 J&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a high output power of 10.3 W&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while maintaining a large stroke of 13.5%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber-based artificial muscles are soft actuators used to mimic the movement of human muscles. However, using high modulus oxide ceramics to fabricate artificial muscles with high energy and power is a challenge as they are prone to brittle fracture during torsion. Here, a ceramic metallization strategy is reported that solves the problem of low torsion and low ductility of alumina (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ceramics by chemical plating a thin copper layer on alumina filaments. These filaments with a high modulus of &#8776;180&#160;GPa can be twisted into chiral coiled artificial muscles, exhibiting a unique electric thermal actuation mechanism. This tough and robust alumina artificial muscle can carry objects equivalent to 0.28 million times its weight and provide high actuation stress of up to 483.5&#160;MPa. In addition, it exhibits 18 times higher contraction power and 240 times higher energy density than human muscles, as well as a high energy conversion efficiency of up to 7.59%, which far exceeds most reported actuated carbon and polymer artificial muscles. This work has achieved large-scale manufacturing of high-modulus oxide ceramic muscles for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Biophotocatalytic Nano&#8208;Organelle Reactors with Programmable DNA Switches for Combating Tumor Metastasis</title>

         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenges of limited light penetration and insufficient oxygen supply in PDT for metastatic tumor treatment, a self&#8208;contained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is engineered with DNA switches using cell&#8208;inspired compartmentalization technology. It utilizes endogenous glucose as a biofuel, luminol as a light source, and hemoglobin as an oxygen supplier to achieve self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer.








Abstract
Metastasis, the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, presents challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its reliance on localized light and oxygen application to tumors. To overcome these limitations, a self&#8208;sustained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is developed here with programmable DNA switches that enables bio&#8208;chem&#8208;photocatalytic cascade&#8208;driven starvation&#8208;photodynamic synergistic therapy against tumor metastasis. Emulating the compartmentalization and positional assembly strategies found in living cells, this nano&#8208;organelle reactor allows quantitative co&#8208;compartmentalization of multiple functional modules for the designed self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT system. Within the space&#8208;confined nanoreactor, biofuel glucose is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which enhances luminol&#8208;based chemiluminescence (CL), consequently driving the generation of photochemical singlet oxygen (1O2) via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. Meanwhile, hemoglobin functions as a synchronized oxygen supplier for both glucose oxidation and PDT, while also exhibiting peroxidase&#8208;like activity to produce hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Crucially, the nanoreactor keeps switching off in normal tissues, with on&#8208;demand activation in tumors through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. These findings demonstrate that this nanoreactor, which is self&#8208;sufficient in light and oxygen and precise in striking tumors, presents a promising paradigm for managing highly metastatic cancers.

         <title>Flat&#8208;Band Electronic Bipolarity in a Janus and Kagome van der Waals Semiconductor Nb3TeI7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus and Kagome van der Waals material Nb3TeI7 exhibits strong electronic bipolar states and robust semiconducting properties with the face&#8208;dependent n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor behaviors. Strong built&#8208;in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is attributed to ferroelectric&#8208;like stacking, amplified by strong electron correlation in the Nb flat bands at the breathing&#8208;Kagome lattice, endowing Nb3TeI7 with a promising material platform for Janus&#8208;material&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Janus materials, a novel class of materials with two faces of different chemical compositions and electronic polarities, offer significant potential for various applications with catalytic reactions, chemical sensing, and optical or electronic responses. A key aspect for such functionalities is face&#8208;dependent electronic bipolarity, which is usually limited by the chemical distinction of terminated surfaces and has not been exploited in the semiconducting regime. Here, it is showed that a Janus and Kagome van der Waals (vdW) material Nb3TeI7 has ferroelectric&#8208;like coherent stacking of the Janus layers and hosts strong electronic bipolar states in the semiconducting regime. A large potential difference of &#8764; 0.7&#160;eV between the I4 and TeI3 terminated surfaces is observed, despite only one fourth of the I atoms being replaced by Te atoms on one side of the layers. Additionally, robust semiconducting properties with the face&#8208;dependent n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor behaviors are demonstrated. These unique properties are attributed to Nb 4d orbital flat bands of the breathing&#8208;Kagome lattice, of which significantly large electron mass makes the semiconducting properties immune to impurity doping, and inherent strong electron correlation enhances asymmetric electron distribution, thereby amplifying a built&#8208;in electric field. These findings highlight that naturally&#8208;grown Janus and Kagome vdW semiconductors provide a promising material platform for utilizing strong electronic bipolarity in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based&#160;applications.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Surface Ligands Enables Versatile Optical Patterning and Form Factor Flexibility in Quantum Dot Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially ligand&#8208;exchanged InP QDs with lipoic acid can undergo direct optical patterning when exposed to UV light, which induces disulfide ring opening, leading to polymerization and the assembly of the QDs. This approach also allows for the creation of stretchable QD films that can be recycled through reversible polymerization. This study provides a solution for future advanced displays and optoelectronics.








Abstract
The evolution of display technologies is rapidly transitioning from traditional screens to advanced augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) and wearable devices, where quantum dots (QDs) serve as crucial pure&#8208;color emitters. While solution processing efficiently forms QD solids, challenges emerge in subsequent stages, such as layer deposition, etching, and solvent immersion. These issues become especially pronounced when developing diverse form factors, necessitating innovative patterning methods that are both reversible and sustainable. Herein, a novel approach utilizing lipoic acid (LA) as a ligand is presented, featuring a carboxylic acid group for QD surface attachment and a reversible disulfide ring structure. Upon i&#8208;line UV exposure, the LA ligand initiates ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), crosslinking the QDs and enhances their solvent resistance. This method enables precise full&#8208;color QD patterns with feature sizes as small as 3&#160;&#181;m and pixel densities exceeding 3788 ppi. Additionally, it supports the fabrication of stretchable QD composites using LA&#8208;derived monomers. The reversible ROP process allows for flexibility, self&#8208;healing, and QD recovery, promoting sustainability and expanding QD applications for ultra&#8208;fine patterning and on&#8208;silicon displays.

         <title>Mesoporous Boron&#8208;Doped Carbon with Curved B4C Active Sites for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media and Air&#8208;Supplied Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbon (meso&#8208;BPC) with highly efficient curved B4C active sites for 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction&#160;catalyst under a neutral electrolyte is reported. Combining experiments with dentity functional theory&#160;calculations, it is revealed that the mesoporous structure and B4C active site on the curved carbon surface significantly improve the oxygen supply and catalytic activity at high current densities and air&#8208;supplied environments.









Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost&#8208;effective and safe alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air&#8208;fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H2O2 production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbons with novel curved B4C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using a pore&#8208;former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B4C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e&#8722; ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B4C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under air&#8208;supplied conditions, along with an impressive O2 utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis in a practical environment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrosynthesis via the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost-effective and safe alternative to the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air-fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B-doped carbons with novel curved B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reduction using a pore-former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under air-supplied conditions, along with an impressive O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis in a practical environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1.6&#8208;Inch Transparent Micro&#8208;Display with Pixel Circuit Integrated microLED Chip Array by Misalignment&#8208;Free Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work demonstrates a radical technology that will transforms the current display industry beyond the backplane limits. The pixel circuit integrated micro&#8208;LED (PIMLED) does not need an active&#8208;matrix backplane but has an active&#8208;pixel circuit into it. The proposed PIMLED is compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer technology and free from angular misalignment during vertical integration.








Abstract
Recent advances in mass transfer technology are expected to bring next&#8208;generation micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;LED) displays into reality, although reliable integration of the active&#8208;matrix backplane with the transferred &#181;LEDs remains as a challenge. Here, the &#181;LED display technology is innovated by demonstrating pixel circuit&#8208;integrated micro&#8208;LEDs (PIMLEDs) and integrating them onto a transparent glass substrate. The PIMLED comprises of low&#8208;temperature poly&#8208;silicon transistors and GaN &#181;LED. The square&#8208;shaped PIMLED is designed to secure a larger process margin but to reduce misalignment in the subsequent bonding process. Its unique four&#8208;fold rotational symmetric design together with concentric circular pixel electrodes of the substrate makes their massive transfer compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer and free from angular misalignment during wafer bonding. The vertically integrated pixels show similar optical and electrical properties regardless of four possible arrangements. It is demonstrated that a 96 &#215; 96 PIMLED display on a transparent glass substrate, which is expected to open a door to novel form&#8208;factor free and transparent &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Minute&#8208;Level Room&#8208;Temperature Switching and Long Cycle Stability of Thermochromic Inorganic Perovskite Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible switching between colored and bleached phases of three colors of inorganic perovskite smart windows is induced using dimethyl sulfoxide vapor at room temperature. Compared with normal houses in field tests, the model houses with three colors of smart windows reached a maximum indoor temperature drop of 2.6, 3.6, and 4.2&#160;&#176;C at noon, respectively, showing excellent energy&#8208;saving potential.








Abstract
Perovskite smart windows (PSWs) are widely investigated owing to excellent thermochromic properties, while restricted by poor transition performance and cycle stability. Herein, dimethyl sulfoxide vapor is utilized as an induction reagent for rapid reversible switching at room temperature between the colored and bleached phases. To obtain PSWs with different optical properties and transition performance, red CsPbIBr2, yellow Rb0.5Cs0.5PbIBr2 and brown CsSn0.1Pb0.9IBr2 are prepared through alloying. The perovskites can exhibit reversible switching at 27.4&#8211;34.3&#160;&#176;C within 1.9&#8211;5.1&#160;min. Even after 100 cycles, they exhibit remarkable stability of luminous transmittance (retention &#8805;97.4%) and transition time (retention &#8805;97.6%). Experimental characterization proves that the reversible switching occurs between colored three&#8208;dimension perovskite phase and bleached zero&#8208;dimension perovskite phase. In the field test (air temperature&#160;=&#160;21.6&#8211;26.5&#160;&#176;C), model houses with PSWs exhibit a maximum indoor temperature drop of 4.2&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, they exhibit considerable temperature modulation ability up to 7.9&#160;&#176;C under a solar simulator (temperature of the control model house&#160;=&#160;60&#160;&#176;C). The decrease in the luminous transmittance of the PSWs after 20 days is 2.9%, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability. This study offers PSWs with prominent transition performance and long cycle stability.

         <title>Distinct Transmission of Left&#8208; and Right&#8208;Handed Magnon Modes in Compensated Ferrimagnet/Antiferromagnet Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnons, thermally generated in a compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, propagate efficiently through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Within NiO, these magnons undergo distinct decay processes, unveiling a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission induced by interfacial spin&#8208;flop coupling. These findings provide new insights for advancing chirality&#8208;based magnonics.








Abstract
The chirality of magnons, exhibiting left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed polarizations analogous to the counterparts of spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down, has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing. However, the potential of this paradigm is constrained by the controllable excitation and transmission of chiral magnons. Here, the magnon transmission is explored in the Gd3Fe5O12/NiO/Pt structures. It is demonstrated that both left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnon modes, thermally generated in the compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, can efficiently propagate through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Remarkably, these modes undergo distinct decay processes in NiO, manifested by different evolutions of the spin diffusion length with temperature. This behavior can be explained by an exchange model rooted in the spin&#8208;flop magnetic configuration between Gd3Fe5O12 and NiO, which establishes a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission. These findings offer significant fundamental insight into controlling chiral magnons, opening avenues for chirality&#8208;based magnonics.

         <title>Bifunctional Group Modulation Strategy Enables MR&#8208;TADF Electroluminescence Toward BT.2020 Green Light Standard</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;bifunctional group modulation strategy&#8221; enables precise emission wavelength control while maintaining exceptionally narrow FWHM values. Non&#8208;sensitized pure green OLEDs based on DBNDS&#8208;TPh exhibited peak EQE of 34.5% and 36.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.76) and (0.19, 0.75) at the doping concentration of 1 and 3 wt.%. This is the first instance of a green OLED in a bottom&#8208;emitting device structure achieving a CIEy value of 0.76.








Abstract
Herein, a parallel &#8220;bifunctional group&#8221; modulation method is proposed to achieve controlled modulation of the emission wavelength and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. As a result, three proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, namely DBNDS&#8208;TPh, DBNDS&#8208;DFPh, and DBNDS&#8208;CNPh, are designed and synthesized, with the first functional dibenzo[b,d]thiophene unit concurrently reducing the bandgap and elevate their triplet state energy. A second functional group 1,1&#8242;:3&#8242;,1&#8243;&#8208;triphenyl, and electron acceptors 1,3&#8208;difluorobenzene and benzonitrile, respectively, to deepen the HOMO and LUMO levels. Accordingly, the CIE coordinates of DBNDS&#8208;TPh, DBNDS&#8208;DFPh, and DBNDS&#8208;CNPh are (0.13, 0.77), (0.14, 0.77), and (0.14, 0.76) respectively, in a dilute toluene solution. This marks the first instance of achieving a CIEy value of 0.77 in dilute toluene solutions. Significantly, the non&#8208;sensitized pure&#8208;green OLEDs based on DBNDS&#8208;TPh and DBNDS&#8208;DFPh demonstrate peak EQE of 35.0% and 34.5%, with corresponding CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.75), (0.17, 0.76) at the doping concentration of 1 wt.%, representing the first green OLED with a CIEy value reaching 0.76 in a bottom&#8208;emitting device structure as reported in the literature.

     alt="Bifunctional Group Modulation Strategy Enables MR-TADF Electroluminescence Toward BT.2020 Green Light Standard"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;bifunctional group modulation strategy&#8221; enables precise emission wavelength control while maintaining exceptionally narrow FWHM values. Non-sensitized pure green OLEDs based on DBNDS-TPh exhibited peak EQE of 34.5% and 36.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.76) and (0.19, 0.75) at the doping concentration of 1 and 3 wt.%. This is the first instance of a green OLED in a bottom-emitting device structure achieving a CIE&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; value of 0.76.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a parallel &#8220;bifunctional group&#8221; modulation method is proposed to achieve controlled modulation of the emission wavelength and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values. As a result, three proof-of-concept emitters, namely DBNDS-TPh, DBNDS-DFPh, and DBNDS-CNPh, are designed and synthesized, with the first functional dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;b,d&lt;/i&gt;]thiophene unit concurrently reducing the bandgap and elevate their triplet state energy. A second functional group &lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;:&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;,&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;-&lt;i&gt;triphenyl&lt;/i&gt;, and electron acceptors &lt;i&gt;1,3-difluorobenzene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;benzonitrile&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, to deepen the HOMO and LUMO levels. Accordingly, the CIE coordinates of DBNDS-TPh, DBNDS-DFPh, and DBNDS-CNPh are (0.13, 0.77), (0.14, 0.77), and (0.14, 0.76) respectively, in a dilute toluene solution. This marks the first instance of achieving a CIE&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; value of 0.77 in dilute toluene solutions. Significantly, the non-sensitized pure-green OLEDs based on DBNDS-TPh and DBNDS-DFPh demonstrate peak EQE of 35.0% and 34.5%, with corresponding CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.75), (0.17, 0.76) at the doping concentration of 1 wt.%, representing the first green OLED with a CIE&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; value reaching 0.76 in a bottom-emitting device structure as reported in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The crystallization mechanism of the biomimetic calcification method triggers a secondary conformational transition of proteins from &#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet in solvents. The adoption of the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation enhances the affinity for metal ions, thereby intensifying the competitive interaction with organic ligands and expediting crystal formation and encapsulation.








Abstract
Biomimetic calcification is a micro&#8208;crystallization process that mimics the natural biomineralization process, where biomacromolecules regulate the formation of inorganic minerals. In this study, it is presented that a protein&#8208;assisted biomimetic calcification method for the in situ synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials. A series of unique core&#8208;shell structures are created by utilizing proteins as templates and guiding agents in the nucleation step, creating ideal conditions for shell growth. To further understand the influence of the protein and organic ligand on the morphology of the MOF shell, the competing mechanism toward metal ions is supposed. Through systematic experiments and analyses, a strategy to construct unique precursor structures by controlling calcification nucleation is proposed. After carbonization, protein&#8208;containing precursors exhibit exceptional porous characteristics, stability, and high nitrogen content. These attributes make them promising materials as sulfur hosts in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSB). Electrochemical tests confirm that biomimetic calcification&#8208;assisted 3D carbonaceous structure can effectively immobilize dissolved polysulfides, demonstrating strong adsorption and catalytic capabilities. This discovery not only opens up new avenues for employing biomimetic calcification as a sustainable method for batteries but also enlightens the fields of materials science, catalytic chemistry, and energy storage.

         <title>Sargassum Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Fully Ingestible Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using food&#8208;safe sargassum nanocellulose as the binder framework, combined with food&#8208;grade additives, a highly biocompatible fully ingestible supercapacitor is successfully employed. This design introduces high mechanical strength and fast ion transport behavior of the nanofiber, achieving a disposable power supply and electrical stimulation antibacterial in vivo, which provides a promising alternative power source for novel medical electronic devices.








Abstract
Small high&#8208;performance energy modules have significant practical value in the biomedical field, such as painless diagnosis, alleviation of gastrointestinal discomfort, and electrical stimulation therapy. However, due to performance limitations and safety concerns, it is a formidable challenge to design a small, emerging ingestible power supply. Here, a fully ingestible supercapacitor (FISC) constructed of sargassum cellulose nanofiber is presented. FISCs exhibit an electrode areal capacitance of 2.29 F cm&#8722;2 and a high energy density of 307 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, over 90% of the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli is achieved during the self&#8208;discharge process. Therefore, following insertion into an enteric capsule, this device can enable a disposable power supply and electrostimulation for bacteriostasis in the intestine after being swallowed by a human, which offers new possibilities for scientific and simple therapy.

         <title>Efficient and Scalable Direct Regeneration of Spent Layered Cathode Materials via Advanced Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel advanced oxidation strategy leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials, facilitating the decomposition of H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; free radicals, which promote oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. It effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine&#8208;containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid&#8208;state regeneration process.








Abstract
Among direct recycling methods for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state regeneration is the route with minimal bottlenecks for industrial application and is highly compatible with the current industrial cathode materials production processes. However, surface structure degradation and interfacial impurities of spent cathodes significantly hinder Li+ replenishment during restoration. Herein, we propose a unique advanced oxidation strategy that leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials to address these challenges. This strategy decomposes H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; free radicals, facilitating oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. As a result, this approach effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine&#8208;containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid&#8208;state regeneration process. The regenerated LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes demonstrate a specific capacity of 206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, comparable to commercially available cathodes. Meanwhile, this advanced oxidation strategy proves adaptable and scalable for treating industrial dismantled LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 black mass. A 3.1&#160;Ah pouch cell assembled with the regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits impressive capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles. Additionally, a techno&#8208;economic analysis reveals that this strategy possesses low energy consumption, minimal environmental footprint, and high economic viability, suggesting its suitability for the battery recycling industry.

         <title>Synergistic Control of Ferroelectric and Optical Properties in Molecular Ferroelectric for Multiplexing Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the synergistic control between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in the molecular ferroelectric material, TMCM&#8208;MnCl3. It demonstrates that FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical writing can trigger FP reversal. This enables a seamless transition between electric&#8208;writing optical&#8208;reading and optical&#8208;writing electrical&#8208;reading modes, hinting at the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory in ferroelectric fields.









Abstract
Utilizing the correlation among diverse physical properties to facilitate multiplexing and multistate memory is anticipated to emerge as an efficient strategy to enhance memory capacity, achieve device miniaturization, and ensure information security. As an important functional material, ferroelectrics have long been considered as a potential candidate in multistate memory devices. Furthermore, the integration of optical response offers an alternative path to realizing multiplexing features, further enhancing the versatility and efficiency of these devices. However, combining ferroelectricity and optical activity is always challenging because ferroelectricity is very sensitive to the crystal structure. In this study, on the correlation between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in molecular ferroelectric material, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese (TMCM&#8208;MnCl3) is reported. This research demonstrated that the FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical illumination can trigger FP reversal. Based on these, both electric&#8208;writing optical&#8208;reading (EWOR) and optical&#8208;writing electrical&#8208;reading (OWER) modes have been conclusively established, and the seamless transition between these two modes can be achieved by adjusting the excitation light intensity. These findings reveal an intriguing physical interconnection and imply the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory functionalities in systems based on ferroelectrics.

&lt;p&gt;This work focuses on the synergistic control between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in the molecular ferroelectric material, TMCM-MnCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It demonstrates that FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical writing can trigger FP reversal. This enables a seamless transition between electric-writing optical-reading and optical-writing electrical-reading modes, hinting at the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory in ferroelectric fields.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the correlation among diverse physical properties to facilitate multiplexing and multistate memory is anticipated to emerge as an efficient strategy to enhance memory capacity, achieve device miniaturization, and ensure information security. As an important functional material, ferroelectrics have long been considered as a potential candidate in multistate memory devices. Furthermore, the integration of optical response offers an alternative path to realizing multiplexing features, further enhancing the versatility and efficiency of these devices. However, combining ferroelectricity and optical activity is always challenging because ferroelectricity is very sensitive to the crystal structure. In this study, on the correlation between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in molecular ferroelectric material, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese (TMCM-MnCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is reported. This research demonstrated that the FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical illumination can trigger FP reversal. Based on these, both electric-writing optical-reading (EWOR) and optical-writing electrical-reading (OWER) modes have been conclusively established, and the seamless transition between these two modes can be achieved by adjusting the excitation light intensity. These findings reveal an intriguing physical interconnection and imply the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory functionalities in systems based on ferroelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Scattering Perovskite Scintillator Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution Computed Tomography Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;scattering CsPbBr3 scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging significantly suppresses light scattering and enhances the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. The scintillator array provides a high spatial&#8208;resolution 3D reconstructed tooth image at a low X&#8208;ray dosage in CT imaging.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) imaging has emerge as an effective medical diagnostic technique due to its rapid and 3D imaging capabilities, often employing indirect imaging methods through scintillator materials. Arraying scintillators that can confine light scattering to enable high&#8208;resolution CT imaging remains an area of ongoing exploration for emerging perovskite scintillators. Here an anti&#8208;scattering cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging using a cost&#8208;effective solution&#8208;processed method is reported. Due to the large refractive index contrast between the scintillator and matrix, photon propagation can be well confined within the CsPbBr3 scintillator array to significantly suppress the light scattering and enhance the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. Furthermore, the scintillator array exhibits low&#8208;dosage and high&#8208;resolution CT imaging capability by reconstructing a 3D tooth image with a good spatial resolution of 20.1 lp cm&#8722;1 at a low effective dose of 0.22 mSv. This work highlights that the CsPbBr3 scintillator array is a highly promising candidate for CT imaging.

         <title>2D Nanochannel Interlayer Realizing High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porous silica nanosheets (PSN)/MXene nanochannel interlayer with selective cation transport characteristics facilitates lithium ion rapid transport while rejects translocation of polysulfides, and the raised p&#8208;band center of the surface O on PSN helps enhance polysulfide conversion kinetics. This work well addresses polysulfide shuttling and dendritic lithium growth, opening up new avenues for expanding application of nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is largely limited by polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics. Herein, 2D nanochannel interlayer composed of alternatively&#8208;stacked porous silica nanosheets (PSN) and Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene are developed. The 2D nanochannels with selective cation transport characteristics facilitate lithium ion rapid transport, while reject the translocation of polysulfide anions across the separator. The hydroxylated MXene shifts the p&#8208;band center of the surface O on PSN closer to the Fermi level, leading to strong absorptive/catalytic effect for polysulfides and thus fast polysulfide transformation kinetics. Together with the ion/electron bi&#8208;conduction function of PSN/MXene, the Li&#8211;S batteries deliver high initial capacity of 1443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle over 800 cycles at 2 C, and excellent rate capability. At a high sulfur loading of 5.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the cells present higher areal specific capacity than commercial lithium ion batteries. The pouch cells with lean electrolyte (E/S = 3.9&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1) yield a capacity of 2&#8208;Ah at 100&#160;mA, high energy density and excellent cycling stability. This contribution opens up new avenues for expanding application of 2D nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Piezoelectric Vitamin&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assemblies for Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically explores piezoelectric response of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies for power generation. Vitamin molecules can self&#8208;assemble into different supramolecular structures exhibiting tunable predicted piezoelectric coefficients. Vitamin B7 D&#8208;biotin (D&#8208;BIO) self&#8208;assemblies with high piezoelectricity are fabricated into piezoelectric devices for human motion monitoring and energy harvesting. These findings will facilitate the exploration and development of biomolecule&#8208;based piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Structural diversity of biomolecules leads to various supramolecular organizations and asymmetric architectures of self&#8208;assemblies with significant piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectricity of biomolecular self&#8208;assemblies has not been fully explored and the relationship between supramolecular structures and piezoelectricity remains poorly understood, which hinders the development of piezoelectric biomaterials. Herein, for the first time, the piezoelectricity of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies for power generation is systematically explored. X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that vitamin molecules can self&#8208;assemble into different supramolecular structures, which exhibited tunable piezoelectric coefficients ranging from 3.8 to 42.8 pC&#160;N&#8722;1 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, vitamin B7 D&#8208;biotin (D&#8208;BIO) self&#8208;assemblies exhibited superior piezoelectricity due to low crystal symmetry and high polarization of supramolecular arrangements. The D&#8208;BIO assemblies&#8208;based piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) produced output voltages of &#8776;0.8 V under a mechanical force of 47 N, showing high mechanical durability after 5400 pressing&#8208;releasing cycles and high stability of at least three months. The PENG&#8208;based wearable sensor successfully detected bending motions of human limbs. Furthermore, the PENG&#8208;based insole converted biomechanical energy into stable electrical energy upon foot movement, illuminating 12 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). This work fills knowledge gaps in piezoelectricity of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies, providing paradigms for realizing high&#8208;performance piezoelectric biomaterials through supramolecular engineering.

         <title>Shear&#8208;Mediated Stabilization of Spin Spiral Order in Multiferroic NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8208;structural phases of 2D multiferroic NiI2 are studied using resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A change of magnetic symmetry from incommensurate collinear to helical spin&#8208;spiral at a structural transition involving a significant interlayer shear is observed. These results highlight the role for interlayer magnetic exchange for driving the magnetic ground state and associated spin&#8208;induced ferroelectricity in NiI2.








Abstract
Type&#8208;II multiferroicity from non&#8208;collinear spin order is recently explored in the van der Waals material NiI2. Despite the importance for improper ferroelectricity, the microscopic mechanism of the helimagnetic order remains poorly understood. Here, the magneto&#8208;structural phases of NiI2 are investigated using resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray scattering (RXS) and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Two competing magnetic phases are identified. Below 60 K, an incommensurate magnetic reflection (q&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.143,0,1.49] reciprocal lattice units) is observed which exhibits finite circular dichroism in RXS, signaling the inversion symmetry&#8208;breaking helimagnetic ground state. At elevated temperature, in the non&#8208;polar phase (60 K&#160;&lt;&#160;T&#160;&lt;&#160;75 K), a distinct q&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.087,0.087,1.5] magnetic order is observed, attributed to a collinear incommensurate (CI) state. The first&#8208;order CI&#8208;helix transition is concomitant with a structural transition characterized by a significant interlayer shear, which drives the helimagnetic ground state as evidenced by a mean&#8208;field Heisenberg model including interlayer exchange and its coupling to the structural distortion. These findings identify interlayer magneto&#8208;structural coupling as the key driver behind multiferroicity in NiI2.

Despite the importance for improper ferroelectricity, the microscopic mechanism of the helimagnetic order remains poorly understood. Here, the magneto-structural phases of NiI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are investigated using resonant magnetic X-ray scattering (RXS) and X-ray diffraction. Two competing magnetic phases are identified. Below 60 K, an incommensurate magnetic reflection (&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.143,0,1.49] reciprocal lattice units) is observed which exhibits finite circular dichroism in RXS, signaling the inversion symmetry-breaking helimagnetic ground state. At elevated temperature, in the non-polar phase (60 K&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;75 K), a distinct &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8776;&#160;&lt;/b&gt;[0.087,0.087,1.5] magnetic order is observed, attributed to a collinear incommensurate (CI) state. The first-order CI-helix transition is concomitant with a structural transition characterized by a significant interlayer shear, which drives the helimagnetic ground state as evidenced by a mean-field Heisenberg model including interlayer exchange and its coupling to the structural distortion. These findings identify interlayer magneto-structural coupling as the key driver behind multiferroicity in NiI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorine Doping&#8208;Assisted Reconstruction of Isolated Cu Sites for CO2 Electroreduction Toward Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine (F) doping is an efficient strategy to facilitate the in situ aggregation of Cu single atoms and stabilize Cu+ species. Consequently, the F&#8208;doped Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction toward multicarbon products, achieving ultrahigh Cu utilization. This is attributed to the formation of abundant Cu nanocrystals with a high ratio of stable Cu+ species.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of multicarbon compounds from CO2 is a promising method for storing renewable electricity and addressing global CO2 issues. Single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising candidates for CO2 reduction, but producing high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) products using a single&#8208;atom structure remains a significant challenge. In this study, a fluorine doping strategy is proposed to facilitate the reconstruction of isolated Cu atoms, promoting multicarbon generation. The in situ formed Cu nanocrystals contain a substantial amount of stable Cu+ species, demonstrating remarkable activity for CO2&#8722;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion. Notably, they achieve the highest Cu utilization, with a C2+ partial current density of &#8722;2.01 A mgper Cu&#8722;1and a C2+ formation rate of 7.03&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mgper Cu&#8722;1at &#8776;&#8722;1&#160;V versus RHE. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations confirm the crucial role of fluorine atoms in structural evolution and electrolysis.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Nanozymes for Ulcerative Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven design strategy is developed for UC therapeutic nanozymes. The optimal CT&#8208;imageable oral UC therapeutic nanozyme SrDy2O4 is successfully discovered and the high&#8208;dimensional structure&#8208;activity relationships between the material database and nanozyme UC therapeutics are further elucidated by machine learning model interpretation in combination with the SISSO method.









Abstract
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with rising prevalence. Due to the recurrent and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat nature of UC symptoms, current pharmacological treatments fail to meet patients' expectations. This study presents a machine learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput screening strategy to expedite the discovery of efficient nanozymes for UC treatment. Therapeutic requirements, including antioxidant property, acid stability, and zeta potential, are quantified and predicted by using a machine learning model. Non&#8208;quantifiable attributes, including intestinal barrier repair efficacy and biosafety, are assessed via high&#8208;throughput screening. Feature significance analysis, sure independence screening, and sparsifying operator symbolic regression reveal the high&#8208;dimensional structure&#8208;activity relationships between material features and therapeutic needs. SrDy2O4 with high stability, low toxicity, targeting ability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability is identified, which reduces ROS production, lowers cytochrome C levels in cytoplasm, and inhibits apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Mice treated with SrDy2O4 show improvements in colon length and body weight compared with dextran sodium sulfate salt&#8208;treated model group. Transcriptomic and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that SrDy2O4 boosts beneficial gut bacteria, and decreases pathogenic bacteria, thereby effectively restoring gut microbiota balance. Moreover, SrDy2O4 offers the advantage of X&#8208;ray imaging without side effects.

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Universal Surface Residual Alkali Conversion Chemistry for Rechargeable Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal surface residual alkali conversion strategy based on NH4F treatment and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. The approach transforms residual alkali into a stable polymer coating which can enhance interfacial stability, suppress lattice oxygen release and reduce side reactions, providing a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for layered oxide cathodes in practical application.








Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are attractive cathode candidates for rechargeable secondary batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, LTMOs suffer from severe capacity attenuation, voltage decay, and sluggish kinetics, resulting from irreversible lattice oxygen evolution and unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Besides, LTMOs accumulate surface residual alkali species, like hydroxides and carbonates, during synthesis, limiting their practical application. Herein, a universal strategy is suggested to in situ convert surface residual alkali into a stable polymer coating layer for LTMOs, thus turning wastes into treasure. The formation process of polymer coating involves NH4F treatment to consume residual alkali, then utilizing generated fluorides to induce the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Implementing this strategy to Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LRM) results in a notable reduction in voltage hysteresis, along with enhanced kinetics and cycling stability in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. With this layer of encapsulation, surface lattice oxygen release and layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition of LRM are significantly alleviated with minimal mechanical degradation and surface parasitic reactions. Such strategy can also be applied to air&#8208;sensitive sodium&#8208;rich LTMOs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries,&#160;which showcases superior universality. This work might provide a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for LTMOs in practical application.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency Through Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Molecular Epitaxial Growth of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks on BiVO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces an innovative method, achieving molecular&#8208;level epitaxial growth of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) on BiVO4 photoanodes by precisely controlling the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The seamless interface of BiVO4/MOF optimizes electron transfer and reduces recombination losses, elevating the overall efficiency of the PEC water oxidation.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface is crucial for high&#8208;performance photoelectrodes, as it directly influences the availability of surface charges for solar water oxidation. However, establishing strong molecular&#8208;level connections between these interfaces to achieve superior interfacial quality presents significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative electrochemical etching method that generates a high concentration of oxygen vacancy sites on BiVO4 surfaces (Ov&#8208;BiVO4), enabling interactions with the oxygen&#8208;rich ligands of MIL&#8208;101. This reduces the formation energy and promotes conformal growth on BiVO4. The Ov&#8208;BiVO4/MIL&#8208;101 composite exhibits an ideal semiconductor/cocatalyst interface, achieving an impressive photocurrent density of 5.91 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 VRHE, along with excellent stability. This high&#8208;performing photoanode enables an unbiased tandem device with an Ov&#8208;BiVO4/MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Si solar cell system, achieving a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 4.33%. The molecular&#8208;level integration mitigates surface states and enhances the internal electric field, facilitating the migration of photogenerated holes into the MIL&#8208;101 overlayer. This process activates highly efficient Fe catalytic sites, which effectively adsorb water molecules, lowering the energy barrier for water oxidation and improving interfacial kinetics. Further studies confirm the broad applicability of oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced molecular epitaxial growth in various MOFs, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for optimizing interfaces and enhancing photocatalytic activity.

This high-performing photoanode enables an unbiased tandem device with an Ov-BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/MIL-101-Si solar cell system, achieving a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 4.33%. The molecular-level integration mitigates surface states and enhances the internal electric field, facilitating the migration of photogenerated holes into the MIL-101 overlayer. This process activates highly efficient Fe catalytic sites, which effectively adsorb water molecules, lowering the energy barrier for water oxidation and improving interfacial kinetics. Further studies confirm the broad applicability of oxygen vacancy-induced molecular epitaxial growth in various MOFs, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for optimizing interfaces and enhancing photocatalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Thermoelectric Performance of Semicrystalline Conducting Polymers by Simply Adding Nucleating Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simply adding a nucleating agent N,N&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA)&#160;to poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (PBTTT&#8208;C14) precisely tunes its crystallization and maximizes structural order. The improved molecular packing reduces disorder and elevates charge mobility. With optimized doping, this polymer achieves remarkable electrical conductivity (up to 1968&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;&#185;) and a power factor &#8776;176&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, expanding possibilities for high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Controlling the microstructure of semiconducting polymers is critical for optimizing thermoelectric performance, yet remains challenging, requiring complex processing techniques like alignment. In this study, a straightforward strategy is introduced to enhance the thermoelectric properties of semi&#8208;crystalline polymer films by incorporating minimal amounts of nucleating agents, a method widely used in traditional polymer industries. By blending less than 1 wt% of N,N&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA) into poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (PBTTT&#8208;C14), controlled modulation of crystallization behavior is achieved, resulting in reduced structural disorder and enhanced charge carrier mobility. Systematic investigations reveal that an optimal PDA loading of 0.9 wt% increases the crystallization degree by 45% compared to pristine PBTTT&#8208;C14 films. Under these optimized conditions, the PDA&#8208;modified PBTTT&#8208;C14 films exhibit a maximum electrical conductivity of 1,894&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum power factor of 176&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, showing improvements of 96% and 433%, respectively, over doped pristine PBTTT&#8208;C14 films. These gains are attributed to the synergistic effects of polymer chain extension and reduced grain boundary resistance, which collectively enhance charge transport efficiency. Additionally, ion exchange doping is found to maintain a high charge carrier concentration while preserving the crystallinity introduced by PDA, paving the way for advanced thermoelectric materials and next&#8208;generation polymer&#8208;based electronics.

         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanofiber and alginate from natural sargassum are used to prepare a fire&#8208;retardant structural material through a hydrogel layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. This bio&#8208;based material has excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and fire retardancy. This work greatly improves the utilization of seaweed residues and natural polymers, provides a bio&#8208;based fire&#8208;retardant strategy, and has important potential in the future development of high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;based materials.









Abstract
With increasing concern about the environmental pollution of petrochemical plastics, people are constantly exploring environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative materials. Compared with petrochemical materials, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of mechanical properties, thermal properties, cost, and biodegradability. However, the flammability of cellulose hinders its practical application to a certain extent, so improving the fire&#8208;retardant properties of cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based materials has become a research focus. Here, cellulose nanofiber and alginate are extracted from abundant natural sargassum as high&#8208;strength nanoscale building blocks, and then a sargassum cellulose fire&#8208;retardant structural material is prepared through a bottom&#8208;up hydrogel layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. The structural materials obtained incorporate excellent mechanical properties (&#8776;297 MPa), thermal stability (&#8776;200&#160;&#176;C), low thermal expansion coefficient (&#8776;7.17 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1), and fire&#8208;retardant properties. This work largely improves the utilization of seaweed residue and natural polymers, providing a bio&#8208;based fire&#8208;retardant strategy, and has a wide range of development prospects in the field of fiber&#8208;based high&#8208;performance structural materials in the future.

A unique Bi&#8208;RuO2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide is rational designed and achieved by phase engineering of the hexagonal close&#8208;packed RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy, to boost oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation, enabling a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.









Abstract
Engineering nanomaterials at single&#8208;atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi&#8208;RuO2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed (hcp) RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy. This Bi&#8208;RuO2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192&#160;mV and superb stability over 650&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59&#160;V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate&#8208;evolving mechanism on Bi&#8208;RuO2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts at atomic&#8208;level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

         <title>A Wenzel Interfaces Design for Homogeneous Solute Distribution Obtains Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super&#8208;hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee&#8208;ring effect during the large&#8208;area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.








Abstract
The coffee&#8208;ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large&#8208;area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO2 is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super&#8208;hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro&#8208;spherical depression structure on the SnO2 surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super&#8208;hydrophilicity and micro&#8208;rough structure on the surface of SnO2, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm2) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus&#8208;coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm2), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high&#8208;performance and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

&lt;p&gt;A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super-hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee-ring effect during the large-area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee-ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large-area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super-hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro-spherical depression structure on the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super-hydrophilicity and micro-rough structure on the surface of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large-scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus-coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high-performance and stable large-scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microglial&#8208;Biomimetic Memantine&#8208;Loaded Polydopamine Nanomedicines for Alleviating Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microglial&#8208;biomimetic memantine&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanomedicine, PDA&#8208;Mem@M, that achieves blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration and brain inflammation site targeting for rapid and precise treatment of depression is designed. PDA&#8208;Mem@M effectively alleviate depression&#8208;like behaviors. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti&#8208;inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.








Abstract
Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, and monoamine&#8208;based antidepressants as first&#8208;line therapy remain ineffective in some patients. The synergistic modulation of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity could be a major strategy for treating depression. In this study, an inflammation&#8208;targeted microglial biomimetic system, PDA&#8208;Mem@M, is reported for treating depression. Microglial membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier and facilitate microglial targeting. Subsequently, owing to the excellent free radical&#8208;scavenging capacity, PDA&#8208;Mem@M attenuate&#160;the brain inflammatory microenvironment. After on&#8208;demand release from the nanoparticles, memantine increases&#160;the expression of brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factors and reverses&#160;the loss of synaptic dendritic spines. Further, in vivo studies demonstrate that PDA&#8208;Mem@M effectively alleviate&#160;depression&#8208;like behaviors to a greater extent than memantine or polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) monotherapy. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti&#8208;inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.

         <title>Phytic Acid&#8208;Induced Gradient Hydrogels for Highly Sensitive and Broad Range Pressure Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct interactions between phytic acid and various polymers are discovered first and leveraged to construct a gradient ionic hydrogel&#8208;based pressure sensor, which offers excellent sensitivity, wide sensing range, and superior low&#8208;pressure detection performance. The gradient ionic hydrogel&#8208;based sensor recognizes subtle pressures from acoustic waves and airflow, moderate pressures due to speaking and finger pressing, and high magnitudes of plantar pressures.








Abstract
Ionic conductive hydrogels have emerged as an excellent option for constructing dielectric layers of interfacial iontronic sensors. Among these, gradient ionic hydrogels, due to the intrinsic gradient elastic modulus, can achieve a wide range of pressure responses. However, the fabrication of gradient hydrogels with optimal mechanical and sensing properties remains a challenge. In this study, it is discovered first that phytic acid (PA) interacts in remarkably distinct manners (i.e., plasticizing effects and phase separation) with different polymers (i.e., polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid). This distinctive PA&#8208;polymer interacting mechanism is innovatively utilized to construct a modulus gradient ionic hydrogel through a simple precursor solution infiltration approach. The gradient hydrogel&#8208;based flexible pressure sensor not only achieves a high sensitivity (9.00&#160;kPa&#8722;1, &lt;15&#160;kPa) and a broad sensing range (from &#8776;3.7&#160;Pa to 1.2&#160;MPa) simultaneously, but also exhibits superior low pressure sensing performance. It successfully recognizes the subtle pressure due to acoustic waves and airflow, as well as the moderate pressure due to speaking and finger pressing and the high magnitude of plantar pressure. In addition, the gradient hydrogel demonstrates remarkable antibacterial properties and biocompatibility. This functional hydrogel with excellent sensing performance and bioactivity exhibits exceptional potential for wearable sensing applications.

         <title>All Light Controlled Five State Logic Gates on a Ferroelectric Ceramic Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel planar three&#8208;electrode structure is constructed on the Ti3+ self&#8208;doping 0.5Ba(Zr0.2TI0.8)O3&#8208;0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT&#8208;BCT) ceramic surface that has an obvious photovoltaic and pyroelectric response. Through a specific polarization method, the device shows a region&#8208;dependent photoelectric response. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are achieved on a single ferroelectric ceramic chip.








Abstract
Differentiating photoelectric response in a single material with a simple approach is desirable for all&#8208;in&#8208;one optoelectronic logical devices. In ferroelectric materials, significantly distinct photoelectric features should be observed if they are in diverse polarization states, unveiling a possible pathway to realize multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates through ferroelectric polarization design. In this study, the Ti3+ self&#8208;doping strategy is first applied to 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3&#8208;0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 ferroelectric ceramics (BZT&#8208;BCT&#8208;xT) through co&#8208;firing metallic Ti powders and BZT&#8208;BCT powders to enhance photoelectric output. Subsequently, on the BZT&#8208;BCT&#8208;3T ceramic surface that has optimal photoelectric properties, three individual regions are separated and heterogeneously polarized by using a novel planar three&#8208;electrodes structure. Intriguing illumination region&#8208;dependent photocurrent directions are demonstrated in this as&#8208;fabricated device. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are integrated into single ferroelectric ceramic via fully light&#8208;controlled methods, including &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221; and &#8220;NOR&#8221;. These gates can be readily switched by simply altering the output electrodes or light intensity of 405&#160;nm LED modulating light. This work not only puts forward an innovative strategy for designing ferroelectric optoelectronic logic gates, but also provides feasibility for more ferroelectric materials to be applied in logical devices.

         <title>Supramolecular Organic Nanofiller: A New Reinforcement Strategy for Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks Toward Upcycling of Carbon Fiber Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers via asynchronous polymerization is proposed. The reinforcement and recyclability of the supramolecular organic nanofillers on DCPN considerably exceed those of traditional methods. This reinforcement strategy is versatile and can be successfully applied for the upcycling of high&#8208;performance CF composites.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPN) provide an important solution to the challenging recyclability of thermoset elastomers. However, dynamic bonds exhibit relatively weak bond energies, considerably decreasing the mechanical properties of DCPN. Herein, a novel reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers through asynchronous polymerization is proposed. Owing to the difference in the reactivity of the isocyanate groups and the gradual deblocking of aldimine, asynchronous cross&#8208;linking of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isocyanate&#8208;terminated prepolymer containing dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds with the deblocked tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine facilitates the transition from the molecular interpenetration of chains into immiscible polymerization. This results in thermodynamic incompatibility between the hyperbranched clusters and long chains, inducing a spontaneous formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers. Compared to traditional reinforcement strategies, supramolecular organic nanofillers considerably improve the mechanical properties of DCPN. Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions between hyperbranched clusters and dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds enable the network with excellent recyclability. The unique reinforcement and recyclability of the prepared DCPN allow their combination with carbon fibers (CF) to form CF composites with outstanding properties for personal&#8208;protection applications, achieving CF composite upcycling. This study offers a novel strategy on the reinforcement of DCPN and the upcycling of high&#8208;performance CF composites.

Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions between hyperbranched clusters and dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds enable the network with excellent recyclability. The unique reinforcement and recyclability of the prepared DCPN allow their combination with carbon fibers (CF) to form CF composites with outstanding properties for personal-protection applications, achieving CF composite upcycling. This study offers a novel strategy on the reinforcement of DCPN and the upcycling of high-performance CF composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
New types of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials have great potential in solving the current global dilemma on energy, environment, and medical care. Herein, based on two kinds of biomolecule&#8208;MOFs (Bio&#8208;MOFs) with favorable biocompatibility and degradation&#8208;reconstruction characteristics, we have established a self&#8208;powered muti&#8208;functional device to achieve an efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum environmental energy collection and biomedical applications. Combining Zn(II) and carnosine&#8208;based Zn&#8208;Car_MOF possessing a high piezoelectric response (d33 = 11.17 pm V&#8722;1) with patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, a tribo&#8208;piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator (TPHG) is constructed with a synergy output of triboelectric and piezoelectric effects. The Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG demonstrates a high output performance (131&#160;V at 100&#160;kPa) and a wide range of pressure response (1&#160;Pa&#8211;100&#160;kPa), possessing applications in environmental energy collection and biomedical sensors. To expand the application of the wearable device, a conductive hexagonal prism MOF (Cu3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Cu&#8208;HHTP)) is synthesized and employed to load thymol (Thy). Cooperating with Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG, the resulting Cu&#8208;HHTP/Thy can achieve an efficient self&#8208;powered ROS (singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH)) generation and drug synergistic broad&#8208;spectrum sterilization effect (efficiency &#8805; 98%). In a word, the flexible wearable device based on the muti&#8208;functional Bio&#8208;MOFs is sustainable and environmentally friendly, possessing wide application potential in fields of environmental energy collection, biosensors, and self&#8208;powered antibacterial.

The high&#8208;entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 cathode material prepared by ultrafast high temperature shock inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves the reversible and stable multielectron transfer, fabulous cycling stability and excellent wide&#8208;temperature range operation from &#8722;50 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The ultrafast sintering strategy provides a broad platform for the development of polyanionic materials for long&#8208;lifespan and all&#8208;climate sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Avoiding severe structural distortion, irreversible phase transition, and realizing the stabilized multielectron redox are vital for promoting the development of high&#8208;performance NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 (HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP) cathode material is prepared by ultrafast high&#8208;temperature shock, which inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves reversible and stable multielectron transfer of 2.4/2.8 e&#8722; at voltage range of 2.0&#8211;4.45/1.5&#8211;4.45 V versus Na+/Na (the capacity of 137.2/162.0 mAh g&#8722;1). The galvanostatic charge/discharge and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests indicate the sequential redox reactions and approximate solid solution phase transition behavior of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. Density functional theory calculations analyze the migration pathways and energy barriers, further confirming the superior reaction kinetics of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. Accordingly, the HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP exhibits outstanding wide temperature applicability and can operate stably in the temperature range of &#8722;50&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C, accompanied by a capacity retention of 92.8% after 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and a capacity of 73.7 mAh g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. The assembled hard carbon//HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP full&#8208;cell offers an energy density of &#8776;301 Wh kg&#8722;1 based on total cathode and anode active mass, verifying the application feasibility of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. This work provides an innovative and ultrafast pathway to rationally fabricate high&#8208;performance cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>Maximizing Output Energy via Suppressing Charge Loss and Increasing Load Voltage in Charge Extraction Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new charge loss and a voltage loss model are proposed and a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&#8722;2 is achieved by the effective collection of interface tribo&#8208;charges and the increase in load voltage during the charge extraction process.








Abstract
The effective collection of interfacial tribo&#8208;charges and an increase in load voltage are two essential factors that improve the output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators. However, some tribo&#8208;charges are hardly collected through one or multiple integrated side electrodes based on corona discharge, and their load voltages are limited by air breakdown in adjacent electrodes. In this study, a dynamic quasi&#8208;dipole potential distribution model is proposed to systematically reveal the mechanisms of interfacial tribo&#8208;charge loss. Based on this model, an optimization route is designed to reduce the interfacial charge loss stepwise, achieving a 15&#8208;fold improvement in charge collection from the tribo&#8208;interface.&#160;A potential difference enhancement strategy is used for the first time to increase the air breakdown threshold between the inner electrodes and increase the output voltage under a large load. By effective increase in charge collection efficiency and load voltage, a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&#8722;2 is obtained. This study refined and optimized the interfacial charge loss mechanisms and provided advanced guidance for efficiently extracting energy during the triboelectrification process.

An efficiently reactant&#8208;enriched and mass traffic system is developed through integrating high&#8208;curvature Pt nanocones with a 3D porous TiAl framework. The 3D multiple interconnected channels in TiAl boosts the mass transport rate, while the high curvature of Pt nanocones induces an ultrahigh local electric field, thereby accelerating the transfer of H3O+ during HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as one of the most advanced methods for the green production of hydrogen, is greatly impeded by inefficient mass transfer. Here we present an efficiently reactant enriched and mass traffic system by integrating high&#8208;curvature Pt nanocones with 3D porous TiAl framework to enhance mass transfer rate.

&lt;p&gt;An efficiently reactant-enriched and mass traffic system is developed through integrating high-curvature Pt nanocones with a 3D porous TiAl framework. The 3D multiple interconnected channels in TiAl boosts the mass transport rate, while the high curvature of Pt nanocones induces an ultrahigh local electric field, thereby accelerating the transfer of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during HER.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as one of the most advanced methods for the green production of hydrogen, is greatly impeded by inefficient mass transfer. Here we present an efficiently reactant enriched and mass traffic system by integrating high-curvature Pt nanocones with 3D porous TiAl framework to enhance mass transfer rate. Theoretical simulations, in situ Raman spectroscopy and potential-dependent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results disclose that the strong local electric field induced by high-curvature Pt can greatly promote the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; supply rate during HER, resulting in &#8764;1.6 times higher H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration around the Pt nanocone than that in electrolyte. X-ray computed tomography and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate the diffusion coefficient of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in 3D TiAl framework surpasses that in commercial carbon support by more than 16.7 times. Consequently, Pt/TiAl-nanocone exhibits a high mass activity of 17.2 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt; at an overpotential of 100 mV with an ultrahigh TOF value of 42.9 atom&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Local Polarization Piezoelectric Electric Field Promoted Water Dissociation for Hydroxyl Radical Generation under Ambient Humidity Condition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generated local polarization piezoelectric field (LPPEF) can be significantly enhanced through ball milling piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) by adsorbing trace amounts of water under ambient humidity conditions. Under this circumstance, the energy barrier for water dissociation can be largely lowered, thus facilitating the breaking of H&#8211;O&#8211;H bonds and the generation of hydroxyl radicals.








Abstract
Combining piezocatalysts with mechanical ball milling for dissociating water to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) offers unprecedented opportunities for energy conversion and environmental remediation. However, the in&#8208;depth insights into the relationship between water and local polarization piezoelectric electric field (LPPEF) are currently lacking, in particularly, the &#183;OH formation mechanism in ball milling driven piezocatalyst system is not systematically elucidated. To this end, the present work constructs a ball milling driven piezoelectric solid/liquid interface between piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) and different contents of water to investigate LPPEF initiated catalytic reaction. Results show that PBOC exhibits an excellent Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) degradation efficiency with a 68.94 and 12.43 times faster rate constant than traditional SiO2 and BaTiO3, respectively. Under ambient humidity condition, the lower energy barrier of water dissociation (0.23&#160;eV) endows &#183;OH generation more energetically favorable than under the water&#8208;oversaturated condition (0.66&#160;eV), and trace water magnifies the polarizability of [BO3] and [BO4] units in PBOC to initiate an enhanced LPPEF, thus it enhances the trapping of lone pairs electrons in trace adsorbed water by holes to contribute a higher yield of &#183;OH. This study constructs a highly correlated field&#8208;initiated electron transfer system that provides opportunities for promoting the performance of piezocatalytic materials.

         <title>Plasmonic Single&#8208;Molecule Affinity Detection at 10&#8722;20 Molar</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>

Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;resonance (SPR) typically detects in the nanomolar range. A pH&#8208;conditioning of a physisorbed biolayer, hosting trillions of capturing antibodies or probes enables SPR to detect a single protein or DNA&#8208;strand in 0.1 mL of plasma. The pH&#8208;conditioning transition the biolayer in a metastable state where a single affinity&#8208;biding event can trigger an amplification mechanism involving a broad self&#8208;propagating electrostatic rearrangement








Abstract
DNA can be readily amplified through replication, enabling the detection of a single&#8208;target copy. A comparable performance for proteins in immunoassays has yet to be fully assessed. Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;resonance (SPR) serves as a probe capable of performing assays at concentrations typically around 10&#8315;&#8313; molar. In this study, plasmonic single&#8208;molecule assays for both proteins and DNA are demonstrated, achieving limits&#8208;of&#8208;detections (LODs) as low as 10&#8315;2&#8304; molar (1&#160;&#177;&#160;1 molecule in 0.1&#160;mL), even in human serum, in 1 h. This represents an improvement in typical SPR LODs by eleven orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude. The single&#8208;molecule SPR assay is achieved with a millimeter&#8208;wide surface functionalized with a physisorbed biolayer comprising trillions of recognition&#8208;elements (antibodies or protein&#8211;probe complexes) which undergo an acidic or alkaline pH&#8208;conditioning. Potentiometric and surface&#8208;probing imaging experiments reveal the phenomenon underlying this extraordinary performance enhancement. The data suggest an unexplored amplification process within the biomaterial, where pH&#8208;conditioning, driving the biolayer in a metastable state, induces a self&#8208;propagating aggregation of partially misfolded proteins, following single&#8208;affinity binding. This process triggers an electrostatic rearrangement, resulting in the displacement of a charge equivalent to 1.5e per 102 recognition elements. Such findings open new opportunities for reliable SPR&#8208;based biosensing at the physical detection limits, with promising applications in point&#8208;of&#8208;care plasmonic systems.

         <title>Spin State Modulation with Oxygen Vacancy Orientates C/N Intermediates for Urea Electrosynthesis of Ultrahigh Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored transformation of high&#8208;spin Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) into low&#8208;spin Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) by introducing oxygen vacancies (Ov) can enhance reduction/adsorption of NO3&#8210;&#8594;*NO and subsequent protonation to generate *NH2 intermediate, which in situ acts as a localized proton donor to promote *CO2&#8594;*COOH on adjacent Ce3+&#8211;O site for generating *CO intermediate, following by cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced C&#8208;/N&#8208;intermediates to achieve efficient urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to synthesize urea has become an effective pathway to alternate the conventional Bosch&#8208;Meiser process, while the complexity of C&#8208;/N&#8208;containing intermediates for C&#8722;N coupling results in the urea electrosynthesis of unsatisfactory efficiency. In this work, an electronic spin state modulation maneuver with oxygen vacancies (Ov) is unveiled to effectively meliorate the oriented generation of key intermediates *NH2 and *CO for C&#8722;N coupling, furnishing urea in ultrahigh yield of 2175.47&#160;&#181;g mg&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and Faraday efficiency of 70.1%. Mechanistic studies expound that Ov can induce the conversion of the high&#8208;spin state Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) of Ni@CeO2&#8722;x to the low&#8208;spin state Ni3+ (t2g6eg1), which markedly enhances the hybridization degree of the Ni 3d and the N 2p orbitals of *NO, facilitating the selective formation of *NH2. Notably, the in situ generated *NH2 intermediates can serve as a localized proton donor to promote the electroreduction of CO2 on the adjacent site Ce3+&#8722;O to exclusively afford *CO, followed by C&#8722;N coupling of each other to efficiently synthesize urea. The strategy of tailored switching of the active site spin state provides a reliable reference to rectify the electronic structure of electrocatalysts for directional CO2 valorization.

         <title>Engineering EVs&#8208;Mediated mRNA Delivery Regulates Microglia Function and Alleviates Depressive&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual delivery system employing extracellular vesicles to mediate the co&#8208;delivery of mRNA and nanozymes exhibits synergistic effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial injury, and their functional crosstalk. This system is capable of regulating microglia function from many aspects, including inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway, inhibiting microglia overactivation, and promoting microglia M2 polarization, and ultimately ameliorates depressive behaviors.









Abstract
The development of new non&#8208;neurotransmitter drugs is an important supplement to the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder. The latest development of mRNA therapy provides the possibility for the treatment of some major diseases. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria constitute a highly interconnected set of fundamental organelles within cells. The interconnection between them forms specific microdomains that play pivotal roles in calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, inflammation, and autophagy. Perturbations in ER&#8208;mitochondrial connections may contribute to the progression of neurological disorders and other diseases. Herein, an extracellular vesicles&#8208;based delivery system, grounded in mRNA gene therapy and integrated with nanomedicine technology is devised. This system is engineered to traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and specifically target the central nervous system (CNS), facilitating the simultaneous delivery of mRNA drugs and metallic nanozymes into the brain. This dual&#8208;pronged approach, targeting ER and mitochondrial crosstalk, inhibits microglial overactivation, promotes M2 polarization of microglia, and suppresses the NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway. Consequently, it significantly alleviates Lipopolysaccharides&#8208;induced neuroinflammatory responses and ameliorates anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors. This study demonstrates a novel antidepressant therapeutic strategy and establishes a new paradigm for mRNA gene therapy in CNS diseases.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Biomass Oxidation via Acid&#8208;Induced In Situ Surface Reconstruction of Multivalent State Coexistence in Metal Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical processes. This study introduces a novel acid&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction strategy on metal foams, enabling efficient biomass transformation. The approach is versatile, adaptable across metals and acids, and provides a scalable platform for green chemistry, demonstrating significant potential for advancing resource recycling and sustainable industrial applications.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic biomass conversion offers a sustainable route for producing organic chemicals, with electrode design being critical to determining reaction rate and selectivity. Herein, a prediction&#8208;synthesis&#8208;validation approach is developed to obtain electrodes for precise biomass conversion, where the coexistence of multiple metal valence states leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the activated redox cycle. This promising integrated foam electrode is developed via acid&#8208;induced surface reconstruction to in situ generate highly active metal (oxy)hydroxide or oxide (MOxHy or MOx) species&#160;on inert foam electrodes, facilitating the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Taking nickel foam electrode as an example, the resulting NiOxHy/Ni catalyst, featuring the coexistence of multivalent states of Ni, exhibits remarkable activity and stability with a FDCA yields over 95% and a Faradaic efficiency of 99%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical analysis reveal an Ni(OH)2/NiOOH&#8208;mediated indirect pathway, with the chemical oxidation of 5&#8208;HMF as the rate&#8208;limiting step. Furthermore, this in situ surface reconstruction approach can be extended to various metal foams (Fe, Cu, FeNi, and NiMo), offering a mild, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for preparing potent foam catalysts. This approach promotes a circular economy by enabling more efficient biomass conversion processes, providing a versatile and impactful tool in the field of sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Bioinspired Smart Triboelectric Soft Pneumatic Actuator&#8208;Enabled Hand Rehabilitation Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, lobster tail&#8208;inspired triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG&#8208;SPA) is introduced, featuring self&#8208;powered sensing capabilities. Leveraging these features, a smart TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot is developed, showing great promise in replacing the traditional assessment method&#8212;which relies on clinicians for manual stretching, subjective resistance evaluation, and experience&#8208;based scoring&#8212;thereby driving the transformation from traditional rehabilitation medicine to modern digital rehabilitation medicine.









Abstract
Quantitative assessment for post&#8208;stroke spasticity remains a significant challenge due to the encountered variable resistance during passive stretching, which can lead to the widely used modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for spasticity assessment depending heavily on rehabilitation physicians. To address these challenges, a high&#8208;force&#8208;output triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator&#160;(TENG&#8208;SPA) inspired by a lobster tail is developed. The bioinspired TENG&#8208;SPA can generate approximately 20 N at 0.1&#160;MPa, providing sufficient stretching force for spastic fingers. The anti&#8208;interference, durability, and electrical output characteristics of the TENG&#8208;SPA under varying conditions&#8212;such as different air pressures, bending frequencies, and simulated spastic finger stretching&#8212;are explored, demonstrating TENG&#8208;SPA's ability to sense resistance during the stretching process. Furthermore, a TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot system integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed, which is tested in a clinical trial involving 15 stroke patients. The results have demonstrated that a classification accuracy for the levels of finger spasticity reaches 93.3% and the MAS scores predicted by the CNN regression model exhibit a strong linear relationship with the actual MAS (R2 = 0.8451, p &lt;&#160;0.01). This study presents promising potential applications in digital rehabilitation medicine, human&#8211;machine interaction, biomedicine, and related fields.

         <title>Engineering Highly Aligned and Densely Populated Cardiac Muscle Bundles via Fibrin Remodeling in 3D&#8208;Printed Anisotropic Microfibrous Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of 3D&#8208;printed anisotropic InterPore microfibrous lattices for engineering aligned and densely populated cardiac muscle bundles. By promoting cardiomyocyte alignment and facilitating cell&#8208;mediated remodeling in these lattices, the approach improves high&#8208;density tissue organization, enhances electrophysiological function, and supports the maturation of cardiac tissues.








Abstract
Replicating the structural and functional features of native myocardium, particularly its high&#8208;density cellular alignment and efficient electrical connectivity, is essential for engineering functional cardiac tissues. Here, novel electrohydrodynamically printed InterPore microfibrous lattices with anisotropic architectures are introduced to promote high&#8208;density cellular alignment and enhanced tissue interconnectivity. The interconnected pores in the microfibrous lattice enable dynamic, cell&#8208;mediated remodeling of fibrous hydrogels, resulting in continuous, mechanically stable tissue bundles. Compared to lattices with isolated pores, the engineered aligned cardiac tissues from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exhibit improved electrophysiological properties and synchronous contractions. Using a multiseeding strategy, an equivalent cell seeding density of 8 &#215; 107 cells&#160;mL&#8722;1, facilitating the formation of multicellular, vascularized cardiac structures with maintained tissue viability and integrity, is achieved. As a demonstration, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiac tissues are engineered with progressive maturation and functional integration over time. These findings underscore the potential of InterPore microfibrous lattices for applications in cardiac tissue engineering, drug discovery, and therapeutic development.

Methanol (MeOH) is introduced as a fluid balance agent to regulate Marangoni convection, thereby mitigating disordered colloidal particle motion. As a result, record power conversion efficiencies of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small&#8208;area FAPbI3 devices (0.07&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (21&#160;cm2), respectively.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coating techniques are widely employed for fabricating small&#8208;size, high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, achieving large&#8208;area, high&#8208;uniformity perovskite films and thus high&#8208;efficiency solar cell devices remain challenging due to the complex fluid dynamics and drying behaviors of perovskite precursor solutions during large&#8208;area fabrication processes. In this work, a high&#8208;quality, pinhole&#8208;free, large&#8208;area FAPbI3 perovskite film is successfully obtained via scalable blade&#8208;coating technology, assisted by a novel bidirectional Marangoni convection strategy. By incorporating methanol (MeOH) as a fluid balance agent, the direction of Marangoni convection is effectively regulated, mitigating the disordered motion of colloidal precursor particles during the printing process. As a result, champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small&#8208;area FAPbI3 devices (0.07&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (21&#160;cm2), respectively. Notably, under steady illumination, the device reached a stabilized PCE of 24.28%. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device exhibited remarkable operational stability, retaining 92.03% of its initial PCE after 1800&#160;h under ambient conditions (35&#160;&#177;&#160;5% relative humidity, 30&#160;&#176;C). To demonstrate the universality of this strategy, a blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode is fabricated, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 14.78% and an electroluminescence wavelength (EL) of 494&#160;nm. This work provides a significant technique for advancing solution&#8208;processed, industrial&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality and stable perovskite films and solar cells.

         <title>Sole&#8208;Solvent High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte Realizes Wide&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Practical Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte is capable of forming stable anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases, extending the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free sodium batteries with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) are realized. Furthermore, Ah&#8208;level pouch cell delivers a leadingly high energy density (209 Wh kg&#8722;1) and a high capacity retention (83.1%) after 100 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium batteries (AFSBs) hold great promise for high&#8208;density energy storage. However, high&#8208;voltage AFSBs, especially those can stably cycle at a wide temperature range are challenging due to the poor electrolyte compatibility toward both the cathode and anode. Herein, high&#8208;voltage AFSBs with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) are realized for the first time via a sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte based on the diethylene glycol dibutyl ether solvent (D2) and NaPF6 salt. The sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte with unique solvent&#8208;ions effect of strong anion interaction and weak cation solvation enables entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte salt disassociation and high&#8208;concentration contact ion pairs, thus simultaneously forming stable anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases on cathode and anode. Moreover, the wide liquid range of D2 further extends the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, ampere&#8208;hour (Ah)&#8208;level anode&#8208;free sodium pouch cells with cyclability in a wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C are realized. Impressively, the pouch cell achieves a leadingly high cell&#8208;level energy density of 209&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 100 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C. This work provides inspirations for designing advanced electrolytes for practical AFSBs.

         <title>Army Ant Nest Inspired Adaptive Textile for Smart Thermal Regulation and Healthcare Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermal adaptability of army ant nest, an innovative textile, Army ant Nest Textile (ANT), is developed for intelligent thermal regulation and healthcare monitoring. The ANT swiftly reacts to perspiration, enhancing heat dissipation through improved radiation transmission and air exchange. Additionally, it integrates colorimetric sensors for temperature, sweat pH, and UV intensity, providing vital risk signals for users.








Abstract
A textile material that can dynamically adapt to different environments while serving as an immediate alert system for early detection of life&#8208;threatening factors in the surroundings, not only enhances the individual's health management but also contributes to a reduction in energy consumption for space cooling and/or heating. In nature, different species have their own adaptation system to ambient temperature. Inspired by the army ant nest, herein a thermal adaptive textile known as Army ant Nest Textile (ANT) for thermal management and health monitoring is reported. This textile can promptly respond to perspiration, rapidly absorb sweat, and then transform its architecture to facilitate heat dissipation. Simultaneously, the colorimetric sensing function of ANT allows it to emulate the &#8220;site migration&#8221; behavior of the army ant nest, which empowers individuals to expeditiously identify multiple health&#8208;related signals such as body temperature, UV radiation, and sweat pH values, and warn them to move to a secure environment, thereby effectively reducing the likelihood of physical harm. Together with its excellent scalability and biocompatibility, the ANT offers a promising direction for the development of next&#8208;generation smart e&#8208;textiles for personal thermal and healthcare management, while satisfying the growing demand for energy saving.

         <title>U&#8208;Shaped Dimeric Acceptors for Balancing Efficiency and Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
U&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptors, 5&#8208;IDT and 6&#8208;IDT, are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component. The efficiencies of 6&#8208;IDT&#8211; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively. Moreover, the smaller molecular length of 5&#8208;IDT can well stabilize the phase&#8208;separated morphology of the active layer, thereby significantly improving the thermal stability.








Abstract
Despite significant improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), achieving excellent stability remains a great challenge to their commercial feasibility. Here, U&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptors (5&#8208;IDT and 6&#8208;IDT) with different molecular lengths are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component, respectively. The introduction of the third component effectively reduces the energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative voltage losses and improves the exciton dissociation and charge transport of the devices. Consequently, the PCEs of the 6&#8208;IDT&#8208; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively, which is the highest PCE for oligomeric acceptors&#8208;based ternary OSCs to date. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the treated devices is dramatically improved, with the initial efficiency retention of the 6&#8208;IDT&#8208; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated devices increasing from 18% to 32% and 75%, respectively, after 1000&#160;h of thermal stress. This is mainly attributed to the ability of the smaller molecular length of 5&#8208;IDT to stabilize the phase&#8208;separated morphology of the polymeric donor and small molecular acceptor, rather than the high glass transition temperature and low diffusion coefficient.

         <title>The Photoinduced Response of Antimony from Femtoseconds to Minutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical properties of antimony make it a promising candidate for photonic memory applications due to the large contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states. This study resolves the entire switching cycle from crystal to glass and back. It elucidates the structural origin of the optical properties of the final and intermediate transient states, which are relevant for high bandwidth photonic applications.








Abstract
As a phase change material (PCM), antimony exhibits a set of desirable properties that make it an interesting candidate for photonic memory applications. These include a large optical contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states over a wide wavelength range. Switching between the states is possible on nanosecond timescales by applying short heating pulses. The glass state is reached through melting and rapid quenching through a supercooled liquid regime. While initial and final states are easily characterized, little is known about the optical properties on the path to forming a glass. Here we resolve the entire switching cycle of antimony with femtosecond resolution in stroboscopic optical pump&#8208;probe measurements and combine the experimental results with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations. The glass formation process of antimony is revealed to be a complex multi&#8208;step process, where the intermediate transient states exhibit distinct optical properties with even larger contrasts than those observed between crystal and glass. The provided quantitative understanding forms the basis for exploitation in high bandwidth photonic&#160;applications.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Locking Vectorial Metasurface Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a general multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography technique encoded by both the spin and orbital angular momentum using a minimalist, non&#8208;interleaved, geometry&#8208;phase metasurface. The approach not only substantially enhances the selectivity of the input light, exhibiting spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking behavior, but also expands the multiplexing capacity of the output optical field, opening new avenues for advanced light manipulation.








Abstract
Vectorial metasurface holography, allowing for independent control over the amplitude, phase, and polarization distribution of holographic images enabled by metasurfaces, plays a crucial role in the realm of optical display, optical, and quantum communications. However, previous research on vectorial metasurface holography has typically been restricted to single degree of freedom input and single channel output, thereby demonstrating a very limited modulation capacity. This work presents a novel method to achieve multi&#8208;channel vectorial metasurface holography by harnessing spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking vortex beams. In each channel, the optical vectorial field is encoded with a pair of total angular momentums (TAMs) featuring two orthogonal spin angular momentums (SAMs) independently locked with arbitrary orbital angular momentums (OAMs). The methodology relies on a modified Gerchberg&#8208;Saxton algorithm, enabling the encoding of various TAM channels within a single phase profile. Consequently, a pure geometry&#8208;phase metasurface with a non&#8208;interleaved approach can be used to support such multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography, achieving high selectivity of both SAM and OAM, and offering precise routing and manipulation of complex light channels. The work presents a paradigm shift in the field of holography, offering promising avenues for high&#8208;density optical information processing and future photonic device design.

         <title>Supramolecular Scale Hydrophilicity Regulation Enabling Efficient Dewatering and Assembly of Nanocellulose into Dense and Strong Bulk Materials as Sustainable Plastic Substitutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dewatering difficulty of nanocellulose dispersion has long been a major challenge hindering its practical utilization. Here, through a supramolecular scale hydrophilicity regulation, the water retention value is substantially decreased and efficient dewatering of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) dispersion is realized, enabling the fabrication of highly dense, strong, fire&#8208;retardant, and moldable CNF bulk materials as sustainable plastic substitutes.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are ideal building blocks for creating lightweight and strong bulk structural materials due to their unique supramolecular structure and exceptional mechanical properties within the crystalline regions. However, assembling CNFs into dense bulk structural materials with customizable shape and functionalities remains a great challenge, hindering their practical applications. Here, the dewatering issue of aqueous CNF dispersions is addressed by regulating supramolecular scale hydrophilicity using lactic acid, combined with hot&#8208;press molding. This approach enables the fabrication of transparent CNF bulk structural materials with a density of up to 1.426&#160;g cm&#8722;3. The mechanical properties, including isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strength (75.5 &#177; 4.5&#160;MPa), flexural strength (198 &#177; 20&#160;MPa), and hardness (&#8776;300&#160;MPa), surpass most engineering plastics. Moreover, unlike conventional CNF based materials, the CNF bulk structural materials exhibit remarkable water stability and flame retardancy. These unique advantages open a new avenue to bottom&#8208;up assembly of CNFs into high&#8208;performance multifunctional eco&#8208;friendly structural materials, dedicating to substitution of plastics and easing the consumption of petrochemical resources.

         <title>Overcoming Energy&#8208;Scaling Barriers: Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;elemental synergy strategy for regulating the local electronic structure is applied to create a broad adsorption energy landscape in high&#8208;entropy alloy catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates in the multi&#8208;step NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, effectively overcoming energy&#8208;scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) is a complex process involving an eight&#8208;electron transfer and numerous intermediates, presenting a significant challenge for optimization. A multi&#8208;elemental synergy strategy to regulate the local electronic structure at the atomic level is proposed, creating a broad adsorption energy landscape in high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates, effectively overcoming energy&#8208;scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis. The HEA catalyst achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.5&#160;&#177;&#160;4.3% and a yield rate of 10.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. It also demonstrated remarkable stability over 250 h in an integrated three&#8208;chamber device, coupling electrocatalysis with an ammonia recovery unit for continuous NH3 collection. This work elucidates the catalytic mechanisms of multi&#8208;functional HEA systems and offers new perspectives for optimizing multi&#8208;step reactions by circumventing adsorption&#8208;energy scaling limitations.

         <title>Multiple Electron Transfers Enable High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Through Stable Anionic Redox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
K2FeSiO4 is synthesized and utilized as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. This compound offers advantages including high elemental abundance, low cost, and structural stability. Ultrahigh capacity can be achieved through charge compensation involving Fe cations and O anions during cycling. Additionally, the strong Si&#9472;O bond can effectively immobilize O anions to prevent excessive lattice oxygen loss.








Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer, low alkali metal contents, and large&#8208;molecular masses limit the capacity of cathodes. This study uses a cost&#8208;effective and light&#8208;molecular&#8208;mass orthosilicate material, K2FeSiO4, with a high initial potassium content, as a cathode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries to enable the transfer of more than one electron. Despite the limited valence change of Fe ions during cycling, K2FeSiO4 can undergo multiple electron transfers via successive oxygen anionic redox reactions to generate a high reversible capacity. Although the formation of O&#8210;O dimers in K2FeSiO4 occur upon removing large amounts of potassium, the strong binding effect of Si on O mitigates irreversible oxygen release and voltage degradation during cycling. K2FeSiO4 achieves 236 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, with an energy density of 520&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which can be comparable with commercial LiFePO4 materials. Moreover, it also exhibits 1400 stable cycles under high&#8208;current conditions. These findings enhance the potential commercialization prospects for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

Despite the limited valence change of Fe ions during cycling, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can undergo multiple electron transfers via successive oxygen anionic redox reactions to generate a high reversible capacity. Although the formation of O&#8210;O dimers in K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; occur upon removing large amounts of potassium, the strong binding effect of Si on O mitigates irreversible oxygen release and voltage degradation during cycling. K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; achieves 236 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with an energy density of 520&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which can be comparable with commercial LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; materials. Moreover, it also exhibits 1400 stable cycles under high-current conditions. These findings enhance the potential commercialization prospects for potassium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Marine&#8208;Degradable Poly(Ester Amide)s with Strong, Up&#8208;Scalable, and Up&#8208;Cyclable Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for fabricating poly(ester amide)s combines the benefits of biodegradable polyesters and strong polyamides. These materials, made from upcycled monomers, form films, and yarns with a tensile strength of 109 MPa, tenacity of 5.0 g de&#8722;1, and withstand ironing temperatures. They achieve 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months and have a low environmental impact.








Abstract
Biodegradable polyesters provide an attractive alternative to non&#8208;degradable plastics but often encounter a tradeoff between biodegradability and mechanical properties because esters are rotational and lack hydrogen bonds. Conversely, natural polyamides, i.e., silk exhibit excellent mechanical strength because amides are non&#8208;rotational and form hydrogen bonds. Unlike esters, the nitrogen in amides can enhance microbial biodegradation. However, protein engineering exhibits limited productivity, and artificial polyamides, i.e., nylon remain non&#8208;degradable due to their hydrophobic nature. Herein, a method is proposed for developing poly(ester amide)s (PEA)s, a polyester and polyamide hybrid, to address prevailing production challenges. These materials are synthesized from upcycled monomers in a 10 L reactor and converted into films and yarns. They achieve a tensile strength of 109 MPa and tenacity of 5.0 g de&#8722;1, while withstanding ironing temperatures. They achieve a remarkable 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months, which is rarely attained by current bioplastics, and exhibit low environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. While biodegradable polyesters have remained within the performance range of commodity plastics, PEAs fall into the high&#8208;performance category, potentially reaching markets that existing biodegradable plastics have not, such as fishing lines and clothing.

         <title>Surface Modification of 3D Biomimetic Shark Denticle Structures for Drag Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic shark denticles with alternating superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions are fabricated through 3D printing. Superhydrophobic and partially superhydrophobic denticles exhibit superior drag reduction performance compared to superhydrophilic ones by minimizing vortex formation, presenting a novel approach to the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimal drag reduction.








Abstract
Shark skin features superhydrophilic and riblet&#8208;textured denticles that provide drag reduction, antifouling, and mechanical protection. The artificial riblet structures exhibit drag reduction capabilities in turbulent flow. However, the effects of the surface wettability of shark denticles and the cavity region underneath the denticle crown on drag reduction remain insufficiently explored. Here, 3D printing is utilized to fabricate realistic staggered and overlapped denticle arrays, modified to achieve superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic, and hybrid configurations, including external riblets hydrophilic/internal cavities hydrophobic (ELIB), and vice versa (EBIL). Denticles of varying heights are also fabricated. The results indicate that superhydrophobic, ELIB, and EBIL denticles outperform superhydrophilic ones in reducing drag, achieving a peak drag reduction rate of &#8776;20%. Notably, shorter denticles further improve drag reduction. Reduced vortex formation within the underneath cavity correlates with improved drag reduction. These vortices can function similarly to rolling bearings while facilitating momentum exchange and increasing skin friction drag. Superhydrophobic or partially superhydrophobic denticles (ELIBD/EBILD) mitigate this effect. This study suggests that sharks may secrete mucus on specific sections of their denticles to further reduce vorticity and drag, offering novel insights into the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimized drag reduction.

         <title>Boosting Amino Acid Synthesis with WOx Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the size of tungsten oxide cluster through carbon defects, sub&#8208;nanoclusters are applied to electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling for amino acid synthesis. Unlike nanoclusters, sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitate potential tuning to optimize hydroxylamine yield, enabling the production of diverse amino acids with &#945;&#8208;keto acids. This study offers an innovative perspective for catalyst design in high&#8208;value electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater and biomass&#8208;derived blocks into high&#8208;value products using renewably generated electricity is a promising approach to modulate the artificial carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, a new synthetic strategy of WOx sub&#8208;nanoclusters is reported and supported on carbon materials as novel efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and its coupling with &#945;&#8208;keto acids. In acidic solutions, the NH3&#8208;NH2OH selectivity can also optimized by adjusting the potential, with the total FE exceeding 80% over a wide potential range. After introducing &#945;&#8208;keto acids, the WOx/D&#8208;CB electrode achieves remarkable activity and selectivity toward C2&#8208;C6 amino acids. For glycine and alanine, impressive FEs of 49.34% and 38.22% based on transitional metal oxides can be obtained, surpassing those of WOx nanoclusters with larger size. In situ analysis and mechanistic studies reveal the critical role of WOx sub&#8208;nanoclusters in reducing the energy barriers of key steps in alanine synthesis. This work opens up new insights into the rational design of cluster catalysts to promote electrochemical amino acid synthesis.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Isolated in Mesoporous Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOFs which are exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
As an alternative to bulk counterparts, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles isolated within conductive mesoporous carbon matrices are of increasing interest for electrochemical applications. Although promising, a &#8220;clean&#8221; carbon surface is generally associated with poor compatibility and weak interactions with metal/ligand precursors, which leads to the growth of MOFs with inhomogeneous particle sizes on outer pore walls. Here, a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOF composites within mesochannels with high dispersity and stability are reported. Mesoporous polydopamine (mesoPDA)&#8208;F127 nanospheres with unique surface chemistry, e.g., nanoconfined spaces, catechol functional groups, pyrrolic N doping, and hydrophilic PEO blocks, are found to be a suitable molecular platform. Sliced cross&#8208;sectional TEM, HAADF&#8208;STEM, and corresponding EDS elemental mapping, as well as nitrogen adsorption characterizations, are utilized to visualize the in situ growth process of ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles. These careful analyses provides direct evidence that the highly dispersed ZIF&#8208;8 is exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. After moderate carbonization of the mesoPDA&#8208;F127/ZIF&#8208;8 nanocomposites, a prototype for a mesoporous carbon&#8208;isolated ZIF&#8208;8 nanostructure is achieved, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons.

         <title>Bioinspired Electrostatic Capture&#8208;and&#8208;Release System for Precise Microdroplet Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative electrostatic capture&#8208;and&#8208;release manipulator enabling precise microdroplet emission and transportation. Utilizing electrostatic forces and dielectric pinning, it achieves controlled, contamination&#8208;free manipulation of nanoscale droplets. The study explores its application in diverse fields, including microfluidics, chemical reactions, and material fabrication, offering a sustainable and highly accurate platform for droplet&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The application of physical fields is crucial for droplet generation and manipulation, underpinning technologies like printing, microfluidic biochips, drug delivery, and flexible sensors. Despite advancements, precise micro/nanoscale droplet generation and accurate microfluidic reactions remain challenging. Inspired by the liquid ejection mechanisms in microscopic organisms, an electrostatic manipulator for the precise capture, emission, and transport of microdroplets is proposed. This approach enables the controlled and periodic emission of nanoscale daughter droplets from microscale parent droplets, achieved through dielectric pinning on surfaces and electrostatic field&#8208;driven forces. Results show precise nanoscale droplet release on inert polymer surfaces, enabling directional, contamination&#8208;free liquid manipulation. Moreover, leveraging surface treatment techniques and robust electrostatic force&#8208;driven transportation, a versatile strategy for droplet generation and manipulation, spanning from microfluidic devices to chemical reaction operations. The novel droplet manipulation phenomena and control strategies can advance the fields of electrostatic&#8208;based microfluidics, materials fabrication, and beyond.

         <title>Tailored Colloidal Shapes in Precursor Solutions for Efficient Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus, perovskite film demonstrates more oriented packing during the blade&#8208;coating process. The regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94&#160;cm2.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies. However, perovskite films deposited by blade&#8208;coating usually exhibit inferior film morphology compared to those fabricated by spin&#8208;coating, which hinders the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the scalable perovskite solar modules (PSMs). Herein, ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Compared to unregulated spherical colloids, the ellipsoidal colloids demonstrate more oriented packing during the blade&#8208;coating process, which is due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus. As a result of the improved film morphology, the regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve superior PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94 cm2, and 89% initial PCE after 600&#160;h continuous operation.
