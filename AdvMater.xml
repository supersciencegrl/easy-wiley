         <title>Crystallographic Spin Torque Conductivity Tensor of Epitaxial IrO2 Thin Films for Oxide Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries are determined for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 epitaxial thin films, via measurements of conventional anti&#8208;damping torques in the high&#8208;symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. Rotational transformations of this tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional torques for IrO2 in the lower&#8208;symmetry orientations, with good agreement.








Abstract
Unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torques arising from electric&#8208;field&#8208;generated spin currents in anisotropic materials have promising potential for spintronic applications, including for perpendicular magnetic switching in high&#8208;density memory applications. Here, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 are determined via measurements of conventional (in&#8208;plane) anti&#8208;damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the high&#8208;symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. It is then tested whether rotational transformations of this same tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional anti&#8208;damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the lower&#8208;symmetry (101), (110), and (111) orientations, finding good agreement. The results confirm that spin&#8208;orbit torques from all these orientations are consistent with the bulk symmetries of IrO2, and show how simple measurements of conventional torques from high&#8208;symmetry orientations of anisotropic thin films can provide an accurate prediction of the unconventional torques from lower&#8208;symmetry orientations.

         <title>Local Polarization Piezoelectric Electric Field Promoted Water Dissociation for Hydroxyl Radical Generation under Ambient Humidity Condition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generated local polarization piezoelectric field (LPPEF) can be significantly enhanced through ball milling piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) by adsorbing trace amounts of water under ambient humidity conditions. Under this circumstance, the energy barrier for water dissociation can be largely lowered, thus facilitating the breaking of H&#8211;O&#8211;H bonds and the generation of hydroxyl radicals.








Abstract
Combining piezocatalysts with mechanical ball milling for dissociating water to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) offers unprecedented opportunities for energy conversion and environmental remediation. However, the in&#8208;depth insights into the relationship between water and local polarization piezoelectric electric field (LPPEF) are currently lacking, in particularly, the &#183;OH formation mechanism in ball milling driven piezocatalyst system is not systematically elucidated. To this end, the present work constructs a ball milling driven piezoelectric solid/liquid interface between piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) and different contents of water to investigate LPPEF initiated catalytic reaction. Results show that PBOC exhibits an excellent Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) degradation efficiency with a 68.94 and 12.43 times faster rate constant than traditional SiO2 and BaTiO3, respectively. Under ambient humidity condition, the lower energy barrier of water dissociation (0.23&#160;eV) endows &#183;OH generation more energetically favorable than under the water&#8208;oversaturated condition (0.66&#160;eV), and trace water magnifies the polarizability of [BO3] and [BO4] units in PBOC to initiate an enhanced LPPEF, thus it enhances the trapping of lone pairs electrons in trace adsorbed water by holes to contribute a higher yield of &#183;OH. This study constructs a highly correlated field&#8208;initiated electron transfer system that provides opportunities for promoting the performance of piezocatalytic materials.

         <title>2D Nanochannel Interlayer Realizing High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porous silica nanosheets (PSN)/MXene nanochannel interlayer with selective cation transport characteristics facilitates lithium ion rapid transport while rejects translocation of polysulfides, and the raised p&#8208;band center of the surface O on PSN helps enhance polysulfide conversion kinetics. This work well addresses polysulfide shuttling and dendritic lithium growth, opening up new avenues for expanding application of nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is largely limited by polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics. Herein, 2D nanochannel interlayer composed of alternatively&#8208;stacked porous silica nanosheets (PSN) and Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene are developed. The 2D nanochannels with selective cation transport characteristics facilitate lithium ion rapid transport, while reject the translocation of polysulfide anions across the separator. The hydroxylated MXene shifts the p&#8208;band center of the surface O on PSN closer to the Fermi level, leading to strong absorptive/catalytic effect for polysulfides and thus fast polysulfide transformation kinetics. Together with the ion/electron bi&#8208;conduction function of PSN/MXene, the Li&#8211;S batteries deliver high initial capacity of 1443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle over 800 cycles at 2 C, and excellent rate capability. At a high sulfur loading of 5.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the cells present higher areal specific capacity than commercial lithium ion batteries. The pouch cells with lean electrolyte (E/S = 3.9&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1) yield a capacity of 2&#8208;Ah at 100&#160;mA, high energy density and excellent cycling stability. This contribution opens up new avenues for expanding application of 2D nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

         <title>The Future of Biohybrid Regenerative Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regenerative biohybrid bioelectronics represent an emerging class of technology combining the therapeutic potential of implantable bioelectronic devices and cell transplantations. In this perspective the future of this class of technology is evaluated, outlining therapeutic targets and applications. It is finished by discussing the technology challenges that remain to be overcome to enable their clinical potential.








Abstract
Biohybrid regenerative bioelectronics are an emerging technology combining implantable devices with cell transplantation. Once implanted, biohybrid regenerative devices integrate with host tissue. The combination of transplant and device provides an avenue to both replace damaged or dysfunctional tissue, and monitor or control its function with high precision. While early challenges in the fusion of the biological and technological components limited development of biohybrid regenerative technologies, progress in the field has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of applications. In this perspective the great potential of this emerging technology for the delivery of therapy is discussed, including both recent research progress and potential new directions. Then the technology barriers are discussed that will need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of biohybrid regenerative devices.

         <title>Rational Design of Advanced Gene Delivery Carriers: Macrophage Phenotype Matters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, it is first revealed that M2 phenotype macrophages with lowered mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) levels are harder to transfect than M1 phenotype (A). To enhance the transfection efficiency in M2 phenotype macrophages, chloroquine is applied to shift M2 to M1 phenotype. This strategy is translated to functional nucleic acid transfection in M2 phenotype macrophages upon bacteria immune evasion (B).








Abstract
Nucleic acid delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect macrophages have attracted increasing attention in diverse applications such as defence against bacterial infection. Regulated by microenvironments in specific applications, macrophages have a heterogenous nature and exist in different phenotypes with diverse functions, e.g., pro&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;inflammatory. However, it is not clear whether macrophage phenotype affects nucleic acid delivery, and which one is harder to transfect, and the design of nucleic acid carriers in harder&#8208;to&#8208;transfect macrophage phenotypes is largely unexplored. Herein, it is first revealed that nucleic acid delivery efficacy in macrophages is influenced by phenotype: IL&#8208;4&#8208;treated &#8220;M2&#8208;like&#8221; macrophages with suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) levels are harder&#8208;to&#8208;transfect than &#8220;M1&#8208;like&#8221; macrophages for mRNA and DNA. This knowledge is then translated to the purpose&#8208;design of gene delivery carriers for harder&#8208;to&#8208;transfect M2 phenotype macrophages dominant upon bacteria immune evasion. By loading chloroquine in tetrasulfide bond&#8208;containing organosilica nanoparticles, the resultant composite promotes macrophage M2 polarization to M1 and increases mTORC1 levels for enhanced translation. The design is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo for pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. It is expected that the findings may provide new knowledge and gene delivery solutions in other applications where the M2 phenotype macrophage is dominant.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, it is first revealed that M2 phenotype macrophages with lowered mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) levels are harder to transfect than M1 phenotype (A). To enhance the transfection efficiency in M2 phenotype macrophages, chloroquine is applied to shift M2 to M1 phenotype. This strategy is translated to functional nucleic acid transfection in M2 phenotype macrophages upon bacteria immune evasion (B).

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Materials Design by Constructing Phase Diagrams for Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic way to develop defect phase diagrams is proposed for advanced materials design. Phase transformation of a Mg grain boundary is triggered by Ga implantation on a microscopy sample. Transformations of structural units and chemical ordering at the same grain boundary are experimentally traced at atomic resolution and modeled by ab initio simulations to construct the defect phase diagram.









Abstract
Phase transformations and crystallographic defects are two essential tools to drive innovations in materials. Bulk materials design via tuning chemical compositions is systematized using phase diagrams. It is shown here that the same thermodynamic concept can be applied to manipulate the chemistry at defects. Grain boundaries in Mg&#8211;Ga system are chosen as a model system, because Ga segregates to the boundaries, while simultaneously improving the strength and ductility of Mg alloys. To reveal the role of grain boundaries, correlated atomic&#8208;scale characterization and simulation to scope and build phase diagrams for defects are presented. The discovery is enabled by triggering phase transformations of individual grain boundaries through local alloying, and sequentially imaging the structural and chemical changes using atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Ab initio simulations determined the thermodynamic stability of grain boundary phases, and found out that increasing Ga content enhances grain boundary cohesion, relating to improved ductility. The methodology to trigger, trace, and simulate defect transformation at atomic resolution enables a systematic development of defect phase diagrams, providing a valuable tool to utilize chemical complexity and phase transformations at&#160;defects.

         <title>Band Alignment Semimetal Heterojunction&#8208;Based Ultrabroadband Photodetector for Noncontact Gesture Interaction with Low Latency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon&#8208;based semimetal heterojunction photodetector, designed with band alignment theory, has been developed which exhibits exceptional sensitivity, an ultra&#8208;broad spectral range, and swift response times. Integrating this detector with a sophisticated spatial&#8208;temporal comparison algorithm and a multi&#8208;channel high&#8208;frequency sampling system, the Infrared Gesture Recognition and Interaction System (IGRIS) is achieved with ultra&#8208;low latency, minimal energy consumption (zero bias), and adaptability to diverse scenarios.








Abstract
Non&#8208;contact gesture recognition and interaction (NGRI) revolutionizes the natural user interface, fundamentally transforming human interactions with daily&#8208;use technology. Conventional NGRI systems frequently encounter obstacles such as pronounced latency and environmental disturbances, including humidity or lighting conditions, resulting in compromised system fluidity and robustness. This study highlights the utilization of silicon&#8208;based semimetal heterojunction photodetectors for precise gesture recognition and seamless human&#8208;machine interaction. Through the application of band alignment theory and sophisticated TCAD simulation, heterojunction barriers are successfully optimized by fine&#8208;tuning parameters including Si doping concentration and semimetal thickness. By strategically aligning vertical material growth and implementing vertical heterojunction configuration, a room temperature detector with exceptional sensitivity (specific detectivity (D*): &#8776;1011 Jones), ultra&#8208;broad spectral range (405&#8211;10600 nm), and rapid response time (&#8776; &#181;s) is achieved. Harnessing its distinguished speed and sensitivity in detecting human infrared radiation, in conjunction with an advanced spatial&#8208;temporal comparison algorithm and a multi&#8208;channel high&#8208;frequency sampling processing design, a NGRI system with low latency, high precision, minimal energy consumption, and versatility across diverse scenarios has been developed. The results pave the way for non&#8208;contact sensor design and may further enhance the practicality and user experience of non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Taming Prolonged Ionic Drift&#8211;Diffusion Dynamics for Brain&#8208;Inspired Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic the energy efficiency of biological neural networks, an artificial neural device that works on long timescales with minimal energy consumption is needed. By leveraging the drift&#8211;diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies, a field&#8208;effect transistor made of an oxide semiconductor achieves a timescale of the order of one second, comparable to that of biological neurons, with negligible power loss.








Abstract
Recent advances in neural network&#8208;based computing have enabled human&#8208;like information processing in areas such as image classification and voice recognition. However, many neural networks run on conventional computers that operate at GHz clock frequency and consume considerable power compared to biological neural networks, such as human brains, which work with a much slower spiking rate. Although many electronic devices aiming to emulate the energy efficiency of biological neural networks have been explored, achieving long timescales while maintaining scalability remains an important challenge. In this study, a field&#8208;effect transistor based on the oxide semiconductor strontium titanate (SrTiO3) achieves leaky integration on a long timescale by leveraging the drift&#8211;diffusion of oxygen vacancies in this material. Experimental analysis and finite&#8208;element model simulations reveal the mechanism behind the leaky integration of the SrTiO3 transistor. With a timescale in the order of one second, which is close to that of biological neuron activity, this transistor is a promising component for biomimicking neuromorphic&#160;computing.

         <title>NADPH Oxidases&#8208;Inspired Reactive Oxygen Biocatalysts with Electron&#8208;Rich Pt Sites to Potently Amplify Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NADPH oxidases&#8208;inspired reactive oxygen biocatalysts with electron&#8208;rich Pt sites are designed to potently amplify immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The synthesized Pt&#9472;WOx presents rapid electron transfer capability for superior reactive oxygen biocatalysis, which directly triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, stimulates tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, and alleviates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment potently for amplifying the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
Clinical immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)&#8208;based immunotherapy of malignant tumors only elicits durable responses in a minority of patients, primarily due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Although inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) through reactive oxygen biocatalyst represents an attractive therapeutic strategy to amplify ICB, currently reported biocatalysts encounter insurmountable challenges in achieving high ROS&#8208;generating activity to induce potent ICD. Here, inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of NADPH oxidases, the design of efficient, robust, and electron&#8208;rich Pt&#8208;based redox centers on the non&#8208;stoichiometric W18O49 substrates (Pt&#9472;WOx) to serve as bioinspired reactive oxygen biocatalysts to potently activate the ICD, which eventually enhance cancer immune responses and amplifies the ICB&#8208;based immunotherapy is reported. These studies demonstrate that the Pt&#9472;WOx exhibits rapid electron transfer capability and can promote the formation of electron&#8208;rich and low oxophilic Pt redox centers for superior reactive oxygen biocatalysis, which enables the Pt&#9472;WOx&#8208;based inducers to trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress directly and stimulate immune responses potently for amplifying the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;based ICB therapy. This bioinspired design provides a straightforward strategy to engineer efficient, robust, and electron&#8208;rich reactive oxygen biocatalysts and also opens up a new avenue to create efficient ICD inducers for primary/metastatic tumor treatments.

Here, inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of NADPH oxidases, the design of efficient, robust, and electron-rich Pt-based redox centers on the non-stoichiometric W&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;49&lt;/sub&gt; substrates (Pt&#9472;WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) to serve as bioinspired reactive oxygen biocatalysts to potently activate the ICD, which eventually enhance cancer immune responses and amplifies the ICB-based immunotherapy is reported. These studies demonstrate that the Pt&#9472;WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits rapid electron transfer capability and can promote the formation of electron-rich and low oxophilic Pt redox centers for superior reactive oxygen biocatalysis, which enables the Pt&#9472;WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based inducers to trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress directly and stimulate immune responses potently for amplifying the anti-PD-L1-based ICB therapy. This bioinspired design provides a straightforward strategy to engineer efficient, robust, and electron-rich reactive oxygen biocatalysts and also opens up a new avenue to create efficient ICD inducers for primary/metastatic tumor treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Architectures of Dendritic Polymers Provide Irreversible Inhibitor to Block Viral Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work introduces functional antiviral polymers that can bind to virus particles and inhibit their interaction with cells. The antiviral polymers can inhibit the cell infection irreversibly only when self&#8208;assembled into 2D supramolecular structures. Monomeric analogs of the dendritic polymer can only inhibit the virus reversibly, thus allowing for the virus to regain infectivity after dilution.








Abstract
In Nature, most known objects can perform their functions only when in supramolecular self&#8208;assembled from, e.g. protein complexes and cell membranes. Here, a dendritic polymer is presented that inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) with an irreversible (virucidal) mechanism only when self&#8208;assembled into a Two&#8208;dimmensional supramolecular polymer (2D&#8208;SupraPol). Monomeric analogs of the dendritic polymer can only inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 reversibly, thus allowing for the virus to regain infectivity after dilution. Upon assembly, 2D&#8208;SupraPol shows a remarkable half&#8208;inhibitory concentration (IC50 30&#160;nM) in vitro and in vivo in a Syrian Hamster model has a good efficacy. Using cryo&#8208;TEM, it is shown that the 2D&#8208;SupraPol has a controllable lateral size that can be tuned by adjusting the pH and use small angle X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering to unveil the architecture of the supramolecular assembly. This functional 2D&#8208;SupraPol, and its supramolecular architecture are proposed, as a prophylaxis nasal spray to inhibit the virus interaction with the respiratory tract.

         <title>Synergistic effect of Hypoxic Conditioning and Cell&#8208;Tethering Colloidal Gels enhanced Productivity of MSC Paracrine Factors and Accelerated Vessel Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces cell&#8208;tethering and oxygenating colloidal hydrogels that prevent cell egression and maintain mild hypoxic conditions while providing mechanical stimulation and interconnected microporous networks. These synergistic multiple factors significantly increase the productivity of paracrine factors of mesenchymal stem cells locally and in a long&#8208;term manner, improving blood flow restoration and muscle regeneration in response to hindlimb ischemia.








Abstract
Microporous hydrogels have been widely used for delivering therapeutic cells. However, several critical issues, such as the lack of control over the harsh environment they are subjected to under pathological conditions and rapid egression of cells from the hydrogels, have produced limited therapeutic outcomes. To address these critical challenges, cell&#8208;tethering and hypoxic conditioning colloidal hydrogels containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are introduced to increase the productivity of paracrine factors locally and in a long&#8208;term manner. Cell&#8208;tethering colloidal hydrogels that are composed of tyramine&#8208;conjugated gelatin prevent cells from egressing through on&#8208;cell oxidative phenolic crosslinks while providing mechanical stimulation and interconnected microporous networks to allow for host&#8208;implant interactions. Oxygenating microparticles&#160;encapsulated in tyramine&#8208;conjugated colloidal microgels continuously generated oxygen for 2 weeks with rapid diffusion, resulting in maintaining a mild hypoxic condition while MSCs consumed oxygen under severe hypoxia. Synergistically, local retention of MSCs within the mild hypoxic&#8208;conditioned and mechanically robust colloidal hydrogels significantly increased the secretion of various angiogenic cytokines and chemokines. The oxygenating colloidal hydrogels induced anti&#8208;inflammatory responses, reduced cellular apoptosis, and promoted numerous large blood vessels in vivo. Finally, mice injected with the MSC&#8208;tethered oxygenating colloidal hydrogels significantly improved blood flow restoration and muscle regeneration in a hindlimb ischemia (HLI) model.

         <title>Quantitative Identification of Dopant Occupation in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative identification of dopant occupation in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials is proposed by macroscopic sample characterizations. The doping sites of Al and Mg are thus statistically revealed, showing an important influence on the activity of oxygen anions for Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.








Abstract
Elemental doping is widely used to improve the performance of cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, macroscopic/statistical investigation on how doping sites are distributed in the material lattice, despite being a key prerequisite for understanding and manipulating the doping effect, has not been effectively established. Herein, to solve this predicament, a universal strategy is proposed to quantitatively identify the locations of Al and Mg dopants in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs). Solid evidence confirms that Al prefers to occupy the transition metal (TM) layer, while Mg evenly occupies both TM and Li layers. As a result, Mg significantly reduces the thickness of LiO2 slabs at room temperature, which will increase the energy barrier of oxygen activation and enhance the structure stability of LLOs. The suppressed oxygen activity in Mg&#8208;doped LLO can be kinetically unlocked at 55&#160;&#176;C. The different characteristics of Al and Mg enlighten an Al/Mg co&#8208;doping strategy to optimize LLOs, which significantly improves the cycle performance while lifting the capacity. These insights from the quantitative identification of doping sites shed light on the manipulation of doping effects toward better cathodes.

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Ultra&#8208;Efficient Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hygroscopic Nanofibers for Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Tillandsia, a thermo&#8208;responsive hygroscopic nanofiber called PCP@LiCl is prepared for atmospheric water harvesting. PCP@LiCl exhibits unique kinetics due to the porous structure, capable of adsorbing moisture to saturation within 2&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and 15%&#8211;30% relative humidity and oozing liquid water within 5&#160;min under sunlight.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising approach for supplying water in off&#8208;grid arid regions. However, it is difficult to improve the SAWH efficiency because water undergoes multiple phase transformations, such as water vapor&#8211;water (desorption and condensation) in the desorption phase. To address this issue, an ultrahygroscopic temperature&#8208;responsive hydrogel nanofiber inspired by Tillandsia is developed, comprising poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide, poly N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, and carbon nanotubes and impregnated with lithium chloride (PCP@LiCl). The hydrophobicity of the nanofiber membrane is enhanced with increasing temperature, facilitating water separation from the hydrogel in liquid form. Moreover, PCP@LiCl exhibits unique kinetics at 25 &#176;C and 15%&#8211;30% relative humidity, capable of adsorbing moisture to saturation within 2&#160;h, and oozing liquid water within 5&#160;min under sunlight. Through global potential modeling, it is demonstrated that PCP@LiCl has potential applications in arid and semiarid regions. This study provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance composites for solar&#8208;powered atmospheric water harvesting.

         <title>Orientation&#8208;Selective Memory Switching in Quasi&#8208;1D NbSe3 Neuromorphic Device for Omnibearing Motion Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the directional formation of conductive filaments, quasi&#8208;1D NbSe3 memristor demonstrates excellent resistive switching behavior with small operating voltages. Anisotropic ion migration in NbSe3 crystals leads to the high orientation selectivity in conductance update, thus contributing to the hardware implementation of omnibearing motion recognition for intelligent driving application with a high accuracy of 95.9%.








Abstract
Intelligent neuromorphic hardware holds considerable promise in addressing the growing demand for massive real&#8208;time data processing in edge computing. Resistive switching materials with intrinsic anisotropy and a compact design of non&#8208;volatile memory devices with the capability of handling spatiotemporally reconstructed data is crucial to perform sophisticated tasks in complex application scenarios. In this study, an anisotropic resistive switching cell with a planar configuration based on lithiated NbSe3 nanosheets is demonstrated. Benefitting from the highly aligned diffusive channel associated with a quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals structure, the memristor patterned along NbSe3 atomic chains presents robust memory switching behavior with superior stability, particularly the low set/reset voltages (0.4&#160;V/&#8722;0.36&#160;V) and extremely small standard deviation (0.041&#160;V/0.051&#160;V), among the best compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. More importantly, unlike traditional resistive switching materials, anisotropic ion migration in NbSe3 crystals leads to a high orientation selectivity in the conductance update. Custom&#8208;designed neuromorphic hardware contributes to the implementation of omnibearing motion recognition for automatic pilot applications, yielding a high accuracy of 95.9% considering variations. This article presents a new strategy based on NbSe3 crystals to develop a neuromorphic computing system with intelligent application scenarios.

         <title>Conformation Influences Biological Fates of Peptide&#8208;Based Nanofilaments by Modulating Protein Adsorption and Interfilament Entanglement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformation&#8208;modulated bio&#8208;interaction of nanofilaments and their biological fates can be controlled by tuning the secondary structure and the density of intermolecular backbone hydrogen bonds. The tetrahydroxyproline&#8208;modified nanofilaments (P5Fs) with a lower degree of &#946;&#8208;sheet display minimal protein adsorption, interfilament entanglement, and phagocytosis, ultimately prolonging in vivo circulation and improving antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Filamentous structures exert biological functions mediated by multivalent interactions with their counterparts in sharp contrast with spherical ones. The physicochemical properties and unique behaviors of nanofilaments that are associated with multivalent interaction with protein are poorly understood. Here, peptide&#8208;based nanofilaments containing different homotetrapeptidic inserts are reported and their protein adsorption and biological fates are tested. By altering the homotetrapeptides, different peptidic conformations are imposed within the nanofilaments, which result in notable differences in the density of the intermolecular hydrogen bond, determining the amount of adsorbed proteins. The adsorbed proteins can further induce interfilament entanglement of different degrees and patterns, which influences biodistribution and phagocytosis. The nanofilaments with tetrahydroxyproline segment exhibit diminish interfilament entanglement, phagocytosis, and improve circulation, biodistribution, and antitumor efficacy. These findings can deepen the understanding of nanofilament&#8208;protein interactions and filament&#8208;filament interactions as in the case of amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaque, and facilitate the rational design of nanofilaments through peptide conformation control for chemical engineering and anticancer drug delivery.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanomotors for Deep Ischemia Penetration and Ferroptosis Inhibition in Neuroprotective Therapy of Ischemic Stroke</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt@LF penetrated into cerebral ischemic area deeply and alleviated &#8220;no&#8208;reflow&#8221; phenomenon efficiently through mechanical thrombolysis. Subsequently, Pt@LF prevented ferroptosis of neurons via ROS clearing, iron chelating, and excess NH4
+ scavenging. Meanwhile, Pt@LF protected M2&#8208;type microglia from ferroptosis and promoted microglia into anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type, as well as relieved hypoxic microenvironment, hence effectively regulating the inflammatory microenvironment.








Abstract
Nerve injury represents the primary reason of mortality and disability in ischemic stroke, but effective drug delivery to the region of cerebral ischemia and hypoxia poses a significant challenge in neuroprotective treatment. To address these clinical challenges, a biomimetic nanomotor, Pt@LF is designed, to facilitate deep delivery of neuroprotective agents and inhibit ferroptosis in ischemic stroke. Pt@LF traverses the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and penetrates into deep cerebral ischemic&#8208;hypoxic areas due to the active targeting capacity of apo&#8208;lactoferrin (Apo&#8208;LF) and the self&#8208;propelling motion properties of nanomotors. Subsequently, Pt@LF loosens thrombus and alleviates the &#8220;no reflow&#8221; phenomenon via mechanical thrombolysis. Thanks to the various enzyme&#8208;like abilities and multi&#8208;target ferroptosis inhibition capability, Pt@LF ameliorates the inflammatory microenvironment and rescues dying neurons. In conclusion, Pt@LF demonstrates efficiently deep penetration and neuroprotective effects in vitro and vivo. And this study provides a promising therapeutic platform for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

         <title>Hardware&#8208;Feasible and Efficient N&#8208;Type Organic Neuromorphic Signal Recognition via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type organic electrochemical synaptic transistor (n&#8208;OEST) is integrated within a simple and hardware&#8208;feasible reservoir computing (RC) framework, enabling efficient recognition of complex signals. This physical RC comprises n&#8208;OESTs for both adaptive reservoirs and single&#8208;layer readout. It achieves image and speech recognition with &gt;90% accuracy and snoring recognition with 98.0% accuracy for practical sleep monitoring.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical synaptic transistors (OESTs), inspired by the biological nervous system, have garnered increasing attention due to their multifunctional applications in neuromorphic computing. However, the practical implementation of OESTs for signal recognition&#8212;particularly those utilizing n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs)&#8212;still faces significant challenges at the hardware level. Here, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type OEST integrated within a physically simple and hardware feasible reservoir&#8208;computing (RC) framework for practical temporal signal recognition is presented. This integration is achieved by leveraging the adjustable synaptic properties of the n&#8208;OEST, which exhibits tunable nonlinear short&#8208;term memory, transitioning from volatility to nonvolatility, and demonstrating adaptive temporal specificity. Additionally, the nonvolatile OEST offers 256 conductance levels and a wide dynamic range (&#8776;147) in long&#8208;term potentiation/depression (LTP/LTD), surpassing previously reported n&#8208;OESTs. By combining volatile n&#8208;OESTs as reservoirs with a single&#8208;layer perceptron readout composed of nonvolatile n&#8208;OEST networks, this physical RC system achieves substantial recognition accuracy for both handwritten&#8208;digit images (94.9%) and spoken digit (90.7%), along with ultrahigh weight efficiency. Furthermore, this system demonstrates outstanding accuracy (98.0%) by grouped RC in practical sleep monitoring, specifically in snoring recognition. Here, a reliable pathway for OMIEC&#8208;driven computing is presented to advance bioinspired hardware&#8208;based neuromorphic computing in the physical world.

         <title>UNLEASH: Ultralow Nanocluster Loading of Pt via Electro&#8208;Acoustic Seasoning of Heterocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High frequency (10 MHz) acoustic wave exposure during Pt electrodeposition onto Au electrodes is shown to enable the&#160;'seasoning' of its surface with a high&#8208;density dispersion of Pt nanoclusters, resulting in an Au/Pt bimetallic catalyst with superior performance for methanol oxidation, and therefore demonstrating the efficient atomic utilization and dispersion afforded by this dynamic surface deposition process.








Abstract
The shift toward sustainable energy has fueled the development of advanced electrocatalysts to enable green fuel production and chemical synthesis.

         <title>Microgels With Electrostatically Controlled Molecular Affinity to Direct Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a precision toolbox to modulate morphogen gradients in tissue cultures. Spatial and temporal gradient control is achieved using sulfated glycosaminoglycan&#8208;based microgels (&#181;GUIDEs) with electrostatically tunable morphogen affinity for tailored release. Individual &#181;GUIDEs act as artificial signaling centers, locally directing vascular morphogenesis with high resolution.








Abstract
Concentration gradients of soluble signaling molecules&#8212;morphogens&#8212;determine the cellular organization in tissue development. Morphogen&#8208;releasing microgels have shown potential to recapitulate this principle in engineered tissue constructs, however, with limited control over the molecular cues in space and time. Inspired by the functionality of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) in morphogen signaling in vivo, a library of sGAG&#8208;based microgels is developed and designated as &#181;Gel Units to Instruct Development (&#181;GUIDEs). Adjustment of the microgel's sGAG sulfation patterns and concentration enabled the programming of electrostatic affinities that control the release of morphogens. Based on computational analyses of molecular transport processes, &#181;GUIDEs provided unprecedented precision in the spatiotemporal modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gradients in a microgel&#8208;in&#8208;gel vasculogenesis model and kidney organoid cultures. The versatile approach offers new options for creating morphogen signaling centers to advance the understanding of tissue and organ development.

         <title>Spatially Precise Light&#8208;Activated Dedoping in Wafer&#8208;Scale MoS2 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Authors demonstrate light activated dedoping (photo&#8208;dedoping) in wafer scale MoS2 with high spatial fidelity. They highlight the critical role of the hole trap states within the oxide interface between the MoS2 and the substrate for driving stable dedoping in wafer scale monolayer MoS2 upon illumination addressing the long&#8208;standing challenges associated with doping these atomically thin materials with high spatial fidelity.








Abstract
2D materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have shown great potential for microelectronics and optoelectronics. However, a major challenge in commercializing these materials is the inability to control their doping&#160;at a wafer scale with high spatial fidelity. Interface chemistry is used with the underlying substrate oxide and concomitant exposure to visible light in ambient conditions for photo&#8208;dedoping wafer scale MoS2. It is hypothesized that the oxide layer traps photoexcited holes, leaving behind long&#8208;lived electrons that become available for surface reactions with ambient air at sulfur vacancies (defect sites) resulting in dedoping. Additionally, high fidelity spatial control is showcased over the dedoping process, by laser writing, and fine control achieved over the degree of doping by modulating the illumination time and power density. This localized change in MoS2 doping density is very stable (at least 7 days) and robust to processing conditions like high temperature and vacuum. The scalability and ease of implementation of this approach can address one of the major issues preventing the &#8220;Lab to Fab&#8221; transition of 2D materials and facilitate its seamless integration for commercial applications in multi&#8208;logic devices, inverters, and other optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel porous polymer based on triphenylamine (LPCMP) is demonstrated as an exceptional cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This study highlights improvements in intrinsic conductivity, practical capacity, and redox potential. The protonated LPCMP cathode shows a capacity of 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 3.6&#160;V, high power density, and maintains stability over 1000 cycles, offering a significant breakthrough for high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power organic LIBs.








Abstract
This paper presents a study on a novel porous polymer based on triphenylamine (LPCMP) as an excellent cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Through structural design and a scalable post&#8208;synthesis approach, improvements in intrinsic conductivity, practical capacity, and redox potential in an organic cathode material is reported. The designed cathode achieves a notable capacity of 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; with an average potential of 3.6&#160;V, using 70% active material content in the electrode. Additionally, through appropriate structural design, the capacity can increase to 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at a high current density of 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (360C), the cathode maintains a capacity of 74&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, enabling full charge within 10 s. A high specific energy density of 569&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; (at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;) is combined with a very high power density of 94.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; (at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185; corresponding to a specific energy density of 263&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;) surpassing the power density of graphene&#8208;based supercapacitors. It exhibits highly stable cyclic performance across various current densities, retaining almost 95% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 5.5C. This work presents a significant breakthrough in developing high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;potential organic materials for sustainable, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;power lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Welding Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced self&#8208;welding method is used to repair defects and cracks in the perovskite layer, thereby improving the long&#8208;term mechanical stability of flexible perovskite cells and modules. The flexible large&#8208;scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm2 achieves a record PCE of 21.65% and retains 93.7% of its initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs) are highly promising for both stationary and mobile applications because of their advantageous features, including mechanical flexibility, their lightweight and thin nature, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a number of drawbacks, such as mechanical instability, make their practical application difficult. Here, self&#8208;welding dynamic diselenide that is triggered by visible light into the structure of F&#8208;PSCs to improve their long&#8208;term stability by repairing cracks and defects in the absorber layer is incorporated. The diselenide confers the flexibility and self&#8208;welding properties to the Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9PbI3 perovskite layer, enabling optimized F&#8208;PSC devices to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.85% while retaining ca. 92% of their initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 3 mm. The corresponding flexible large&#8208;scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm2 achieved a record PCE of 21.65%.

&lt;p&gt;A visible-light-induced self-welding method is used to repair defects and cracks in the perovskite layer, thereby improving the long-term mechanical stability of flexible perovskite cells and modules. The flexible large-scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieves a record PCE of 21.65% and retains 93.7% of its initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible perovskite solar cells (F-PSCs) are highly promising for both stationary and mobile applications because of their advantageous features, including mechanical flexibility, their lightweight and thin nature, and cost-effectiveness. However, a number of drawbacks, such as mechanical instability, make their practical application difficult. Here, self-welding dynamic diselenide that is triggered by visible light into the structure of F-PSCs to improve their long-term stability by repairing cracks and defects in the absorber layer is incorporated. The diselenide confers the flexibility and self-welding properties to the Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite layer, enabling optimized F-PSC devices to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.85% while retaining ca. 92% of their initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 3 mm. The corresponding flexible large-scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieved a record PCE of 21.65%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stepwise Melting&#8208;Polymerizing Molecule for Hydrophobic Grain&#8208;Scale Encapsulated Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise melting&#8208;polymerizing molecule (SMPM) additive enables grain&#8208;scale encapsulated perovskite, achieving highly water&#8208;resistant perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with 25.21% efficiency and over 2000h T95 stability under 85% relative humidity. Unencapsulated SMPM&#8208;PSCs even operate underwater and show effectively suppressed Pb&#8208;leakage, potentially solving stability and environmental concerns for PSC commercialization.








Abstract
Despite the ongoing increase in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, the stability issues of perovskite have been a significant hindrance to its commercialization. In response to this challenge, a stepwise melting&#8208;polymerizing molecule (SMPM) is designed as an additive into FAPbI3 perovskite. SMPM undergoes a three&#8208;stage phase transition during the perovskite annealing process: initially melting from solid to liquid state, followed by overflowing grain boundaries, and finally self&#8208;polymerizing to form a hydrophobic grain&#8208;scale encapsulation in perovskite solar cells, providing protection against humidity&#8208;induced degradation. With this unique property, coupled with the advantages of improved crystallization, diminished non&#8208;radiative recombination, and energy level alignment, FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells with a 25.21% (small&#8208;area) and 22.94% (1 cm2) power conversion efficiency and over 2000 h T95% stability under 85% relative humidity is achieved. Furthermore, the SMPM&#8208;based perovskite solar cells without external encapsulations sustain impressive stability during underwater operation, in which the black FAPbI3 phase is maintained and Pb&#8208;leakage is also effectively suppressed. Therefore, the SMPM strategy can offer a sustainable settlement in both stability and environmental issues for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Biodegradable Zn&#8208;Based Porous Scaffolds to Suppress Osteosarcoma and Promote Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>

This work shows the schematic diagram showing the potential application of 3D&#8208;printed Zn&#8208;Li porous scaffold in osteosarcoma postoperative therapy. The L&#8208;PBF fabricated Zn&#8208;0.8Li Gyroid scaffold with favorable mechanical properties can optimally balance the co&#8208;release of Zn2+ and Li+, inhibiting the malignant biological behavior of tumor and promoting osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Postoperative therapies for osteosarcoma present substantial challenges due to tumor recurrence and extensive bone defects. To tackle these challenges, laser powder bed fusion is utilized to fabricate biodegradable Zn&#8208;Li porous scaffolds that supress tumors and promote osteogenesis. After the structure design and composition selection, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li porous scaffold with Gyroid unit optimally balances the co&#8208;release of Zn2+ and Li+ during degradation, resulting in favorable antitumor and osteogenic effects. In vitro, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold significantly inhibits osteosarcoma progression by suppressing tumor cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, alleviating migration, and simultaneously promotes osteogenic differentiation through the enhanced expression of osteogenic markers. In vivo, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold inhibits the malignant osteosarcoma behavior and facilitates bone regeneration in areas with bone defects. Transcriptomic analysis further reveals that the simultaneous release of Zn2+ and Li+ from the biodegradable Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold contributes to anti&#8208;osteosarcoma activity by downregulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Taken together, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li porous scaffold fabricated using laser powder bed fusion with enhanced antitumor and osteogenic properties is a promising alternative for the postoperative management of osteosarcoma.

         <title>Efficient PFAS Removal Using Reusable and Non&#8208;Toxic 3D Printed Porous Trianglamine Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, trianglamine, a class of Schiff base macrocycles is used. Combining with pluronic to design by stereolithography process, a novel 3D&#8208;Porous Hydrogel (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;) is made. This innovative material, with no fluoride groups, is capable of picking up a broad spectrum of PFAS from aqueous solutions via fast kinetics. This new adsorbent is non&#8208;toxic, cheap, stable, and scalable.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now a paramount concern in water remediation. Nowadays, urgent action is required for the development of advanced technologies aimed at capturing PFAS and mitigating their impact. To offer a solution, a functional 3D printed hydrogel tailored is designed to trap a broad spectrum of PFAS contaminants. The hydrogel is made of a photo&#8208;crosslinked dimethacrylate&#8208;ureido&#8208;trianglamine (DMU&#8208;&#916;) and Pluronic P123 dimethacrylate (PDM) fabricated by stereolithography (SLA). With the aid of 3D&#8208;printing, porous and nonporous hydrogels (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;, 3D&#8208;SH&#916;) as well as quaternized hydrogels (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;Q+) are prepared. These tailored hydrogels, show high uptake capacities and fast removal kinetics for PFAS from aqueous sources. The PFAS removal efficiency of these hydrogels are then compared to P123 hydrogels with no trianglamine (3D&#8208;SH). The 3D&#8208;SH hydrogel shows no affinity to PFAS, proving that the sorption is due to the interaction between the trianglamine (&#916;) and PFAS. Metadynamic simulations also confirmed this interaction. The porous matrices showed the fastest and highest uptake capacity. 3D&#8208;PSH&#916; is able to capture &#8776; 91% of PFAS within 5 h using initial concentrations of 5 and 0.5 ppm in both deionized and river water. The sorption of PFAS is further enhanced by introducing permanent positive charges to the structure of the porous hydrogels, resulting in even faster sorption kinetics for both long and short PFAS chains with diverse polar heads. Besides the remarkable efficiency in capturing PFAS, these designed hydrogels are non&#8208;toxic and have outstanding chemical and thermal stability, making them a brilliant candidate for mass use in the combat against PFAS pollution.

         <title>Universal Approach for Managing Iodine Migration in Inverted Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study improves the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by introducing a Lewis&#8208;acid boronic ester&#8208;containing agent&#160;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole,5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4,7&#8208;bis(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#160;(BT2F&#8208;2B) into the perovskite precursor solution. It also provides a universal method for enhancing the stability of PSCs and a feasible approach for developing high&#8208;performance and durable PSCs for perovskite systems with different bandgaps.








Abstract
Despite significant progress in the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the instability of devices remains a considerable obstacle for commercial applications. This instability primarily originates from the migration of halide ions&#8212;particularly iodide ions (I&#8722;). Under light exposure and thermal stress, I&#8722; migrates and transforms into I2, leading to irreversible degradation and performance loss. To address this issue, we introduced the additive 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole,5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4,7&#8208;bis(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) (BT2F&#8208;2B) into the perovskite.

&lt;p&gt;This study improves the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by introducing a Lewis-acid boronic ester-containing agent&#160;2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)&#160;(BT2F-2B) into the perovskite precursor solution. It also provides a universal method for enhancing the stability of PSCs and a feasible approach for developing high-performance and durable PSCs for perovskite systems with different bandgaps.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite significant progress in the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the instability of devices remains a considerable obstacle for commercial applications. This instability primarily originates from the migration of halide ions&#8212;particularly iodide ions (I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Under light exposure and thermal stress, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; migrates and transforms into I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to irreversible degradation and performance loss. To address this issue, we introduced the additive 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) (BT2F-2B) into the perovskite. The strong coordination between the unhybridized p orbital and lone-pair electrons from I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; inhibits the deprotonation of MAI/FAI and the subsequent conversion of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to I&#8322;. The highly electronegative fluorine enhances its electrostatic interaction with I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, the synergistic effect of BT2F-2B effectively suppresses the decomposition of perovskite and the defect density of the iodide vacancies. This approach delivers a PCE over 26% for inverted single-junction PSCs, with exceptional operational stability. According to the ISOS-L-3 testing protocol (maximum power point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C and 50% relative humidity), treated PSCs retain 85% of their original PCE after 1000 h of aging. When the BT2F-2B is applied to a wide-bandgap (1.77 eV) perovskite system, the PCE of all-perovskite tandem solar cells reaches 27.8%, confirming the universality of the proposed strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Naturally Inspired Tree&#8208;Ring Structured Dressing Provides Sustained Wound Tightening and Accelerates Closure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the tree ring structure, a core ring structure hydrogel dressing with mechanical modulation has been designed. The ring portion adheres tightly to the wound edge, while the core portion spontaneously contracts with body temperature, continuously pulling and contracting the wound. This ingenious design provides excellent therapeutic benefits including epidermal regeneration, collagen deposition, extracellular matrix organization, and vascular maturation.








Abstract
Mechanically regulated wound dressings require a rational combination of contraction and adhesion functions as well as balancing exudate&#8208;induced swelling issues. However, many of the reported dressings face the dilemma of impaired function and impeded wound self&#8208;contraction due to fluid&#8208;absorbing swelling. In this study, inspired by the tree ring, a core&#8211;ring structured hydrogel dressing capable of mechanical modulation is designed, and prepare it using a simple two&#8208;step photopolymerization process. The core covers the center of the wound, contracts spontaneously at body temperature to generate a contractile force of 3.4&#160;kPa, and resists swelling. Meanwhile, the ring adheres to the normal epidermis around the wound and transfers the contraction stress to the wound edge. The integration of a functionally independent core and ring ultimately achieves effective wound traction and avoids dressing swelling. In murine and porcine skin wound&#8208;healing models, this hydrogel with a closely connected core and ring promotes healing by accelerating epidermal closure (50% closure in mouse skin on day 2, 85% closure in pig skin on day 8), collagen deposition, vascular maturation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These results can guide further research on mechanical force modulation in wound healing, with the potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Multiple Microscopic Stresses Through Tunable Microcapsule Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a method for detecting localized stress variations with micrometer resolution. It utilizes embedded microcapsule arrays that fluoresce in distinct colors at specific stress thresholds. First, microfluidic synthesis creates fluorescent dye&#8208;filled microcapsules with precise stress response. Afterward, these microcapsules are organized into arrays and embedded in elastomer films via a capillary assembly process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting materials have emerged as a promising tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of stress and damage in structural materials. When critical stress is applied to these materials, an optical response is triggered &#8211; for example by dye release, or molecular cleavage. A key challenge is to extend these systems to respond to multiple different stress levels. To achieve this, a novel microcapsule&#8208;based assembly strategy is presented. Microfluidic synthesis is used to create microcapsules that release dye at a precise level of applied force. Subsequently, capillary assembly is used to combine microcapsules with different stress&#8208;responsiveness and different fluorescent dyes into chains, which are uniformly patterned into regular arrays, and embed these into the self&#8208;reporting materials. Through indentation experiments, it is shown that these materials can distinguish and record spatially resolved local stresses based on the fluorescence emitted upon microcapsule rupture. Crucially, the technique's accuracy is significantly improved when microcapsules are spatially organized within the material. This versatile technique can be applied to a range of different materials, via the use of thin coatings containing the regularly patterned microcapsule chains.

         <title>Cooling&#8208;Induced Order&#8211;Disorder Phase Transition in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a temperature&#8208;driven order&#8211;disorder phase transition occurring in CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices. Temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal the loss of crystallinity of superlattices upon cooling and identify ligands solidification as the main driving force for this transition. Surface ligand engineering mitigates the structural degradation and results in strong exciton migration within the superlattice at cryogenic temperatures.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystal superlattices are being actively studied after reports have emerged on collective excitonic properties at cryogenic temperatures, where energetic disorder is minimized due to the frozen lattice vibrations. However, an important issue related to structural disorder of superlattices at low temperatures has received little attention to date. In this work, it is shown that CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices undergo a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition upon cooling to 90 K. The transition consists of the loss of structural coherence, that is, increased nanocrystal misalignment, and contraction of the superlattices, as revealed by temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, and is ascribed to the solidification of ligands (on the basis of Raman spectroscopy). Introducing shorter amines on the nanocrystal surface allows to mitigate these changes, improve order, and shorten interparticle distance. It is demonstrated that the low temperature phase of the short ligand&#8208;capped nanocrystal superlattices is characterized by a strong exciton migration observable in the photoluminescence decay, which is due to the shrinkage of the inter&#8208;nanocrystal distance.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Assisted Dry Coating Electrode Unlocking Sustainable and High&#8208;Performance Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal&#8208;assistant dry coating approach is reported for solvent&#8208;free preparation of Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich (LMR) electrodes. The lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB) and succinonitrile (SN) serve as key mediators for Li+ transport, and the melting of SN&#8208;LiDFOB can significantly improve the distribution of electrode components. The resulting LMR electrodes exhibit a remarkable energy density and rate capability.








Abstract
Current battery production relies on the use of large amounts of N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidnone (NMP) solvent during electrode preparation, which raises serious concerns in material cost, energy consumption, and toxicity, thus demanding the innovation of dry electrodes with excellent performance. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dry electrodes show inferior energy densities, particularly under high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity and fast charge/discharge conditions required for practical applications. Here dry production of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich (LMR) cathodes is shown based on a thermal&#8208;assistant approach. The lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB) and succinonitrile (SN) serve as two key electrode mediators to facilitate Li+ transport, and the mild heating process for melting SN&#8208;LiDFOB has significantly improved the distribution of various components in the electrode. These synergistic effects enable dry LMR cathodes with a maximum rate capability of 4 C (12 mA cm&#8722;2) and an areal capacity of 11.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The resulting Li metal/LMR full cell exhibits the maximum energy and power densities of 609&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 2,183&#160;W kg&#8722;1, respectively, based on the total mass of the cathode and anode. These results not only break through the key bottleneck in energy density for dry electrodes but, in a broader context, open a new avenue for green and sustainable battery production.

These synergistic effects enable dry LMR cathodes with a maximum rate capability of 4 C (12 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and an areal capacity of 11.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The resulting Li metal/LMR full cell exhibits the maximum energy and power densities of 609&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2,183&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, based on the total mass of the cathode and anode. These results not only break through the key bottleneck in energy density for dry electrodes but, in a broader context, open a new avenue for green and sustainable battery production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Lithography Paradigm Enabled by Mechanically Peelable Resists</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable lithography paradigm enabled by mechanically peelable resists is demonstrated. This paradigm involves chemical&#8208;free resist stripping, and 100%&#8208;yield mechanical lift&#8208;off, and enables reliable conformal manufacturing of transient electronics. Various exemplary demonstrations indicate this technology could potentially establish a standard lift&#8208;off process for the pan&#8208;semiconductor industry and open new avenues for the mass production of transient electronics and integrated biodegradable devices.








Abstract
Lithography is critical in micro&#8208; and nanofabrication processes, enabling the development of integrated circuits, semiconductor devices, and various advanced electronic and photonic systems. However, there are challenges related to sustainability, efficiency, and yield, as well as compatibility with transient electronics. This work introduces a sustainable lithography paradigm employing mechanically peelable resists compatible with existing cleanroom processes. The resists exhibit near&#8208;zero adhesion to various substrates, facilitating efficient, cost&#8208;effective, environmentally friendly, and chemical&#8208;free mechanical stripping without observable particulate residues. The mechanical lift&#8208;off process enables scalable and 100%&#8208;yield pattern transfer using commercially available tape within seconds. Furthermore, the new paradigm supports distributed and in situ conformal manufacturing using the peelable resist as a &#8220;transferable stencil mask&#8221; to fabricate various functional devices on flexible and nonplanar surfaces, as well as ultra&#8208;thin biodegradable substrates. Overall, this work expands the potential for using lift&#8208;off as a standard process in the pan&#8208;semiconductor industry and opens new avenues for lithographic procedures aimed at the reliable mass production of transient electronics and integrated biodegradable devices, addressing growing sustainability issues caused by electronic waste.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Polyphenol&#8208;Based Antidepressant for Alleviating Colitis&#8208;Associated Mental Disorders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research develops a metal&#8211;polyphenol&#8208;based nanomaterial for use as an antidepressant, which can be orally administered for modulating the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis in colitis mice. The nanomaterial reduces neuroinflammation, enhances hippocampal neural plasticity, modulates hippocampal immune responses, and restores neurotransmitter homeostasis in colitis mice, eventually alleviating colitis&#8208;associated mental disorders, including depression&#8208;like behavior, anxiety&#8208;like behavior, cognitive impairment, and despair.








Abstract
Emerging evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are predisposed to psychosocial disturbances, such as depression and anxiety. Regrettably, clinical antidepressants exhibit unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy in IBD&#8208;associated psychosocial disturbances, primarily attributed to the inherent intestinal disorders and intricate bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain. Herein, we report a metal&#8211;polyphenol&#8208;based antidepressant to alleviate mental disorders in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced experimental acute colitis mice via modulating the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis. The antidepressant, termed CSMTC, comprises a core of melittin&#8208;encapsulated natural antioxidant enzymes (i.e., catalase and superoxide dismutase) and a protective shell composed of tannic acid&#8211;cerium ion network. Upon oral administration to colitis mice, CSMTC can effectively restore colonic redox balance, reinforce the intestinal barrier, modulate gut microbiota composition, maintain the blood&#8211;brain barrier integrity, and regulate systemic immune responses. Notably, behavioral test results reveal that CSMTC significantly alleviates the colitis&#8208;associated mental disorder (e.g., depression&#8208;like behavior) via the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis by reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing hippocampal neural plasticity, modulating hippocampal immune responses, and restoring neurotransmitter homeostasis. This work may have implications for the development of new nanodrugs for treating inflammation&#8208;associated complications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II AIE Liposomes for Boosting Type&#8208;I Photodynamic and Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy in Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant NIR&#8208;II FLI and improved type&#8208;I PDT/mild&#8208;temperature PTT therapy in breast cancer treatment are achieved using NIR&#8208;II AIE photosensitizers constructed by dual&#8208;strategy methods combining donor group engineering and fluorination engineering.








Abstract
Phototheranositcs has recently aroused extreme attention due to its exceptional advantages. However, the poor photothernostic efficiency, limited penetration depth, strong oxygen&#8208;dependence, and inevitable damage to normal tissue of conventional photothernostic materials severely hindered their total theranostic efficacy. Herein, a series of near&#8208;infrared second (NIR&#8208;II) photosensitizers (PSs) featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (FLI), type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and mild&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) are constructed through dual&#8208;strategy methods combining donor group engineering and fluorination engineering. Profiting from sufficient molecular rotors and high electronegativity of fluorine, the developed 2&#8208;(2&#8208;((5&#8208;(4&#8208;((4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)(phenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (BTS&#8208;2F) and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;((5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (TTS&#8208;2F) are endowed with NIR&#8208;II AIE property, high radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability and mild&#8208;temperature photothermal conversion. Through thin film hydration method, the prepared BTS&#8208;2F and TTS&#8208;2F&#160;loaded liposomes exhibit significant NIR&#8208;II FLI and improved type&#8208;I PDT/mild&#8208;temperature PTT therapy under laser irradiation both in vitro and orthotopic 4T1 mice models.

         <title>Bacteriophage&#8208;Activated DNAzyme Hydrogels Combined with Machine Learning Enable Point&#8208;of&#8208;Use Colorimetric Detection of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric hydrogel sensing platform for the detection of pathogens in water and clinical samples is described. The polyacrylamide hydrogel is held together with pathogen&#8208;responsive DNAzyme&#8208;substrate cross&#8208;linking and has demonstrated high sensitivity for detecting E. coli in lake water and urine. The bacteriophage&#8208;mediated signal amplification effect outlined in the design has potential applications for future biosensor development.








Abstract
Developing cost&#8208;effective, consumer&#8208;accessible platforms for point&#8208;of&#8208;use environmental and clinical pathogen testing is a priority, to reduce reliance on laborious, time&#8208;consuming culturing approaches. Unfortunately, a system offering ultrasensitive detection capabilities in a form that requires little auxiliary equipment or training has remained elusive. Here, a colorimetric DNAzyme&#8208;crosslinked hydrogel sensor is presented. In the presence of a target pathogen, DNAzyme cleavage results in hydrogel dissolution, yielding the release of entrapped gold nanoparticles in a manner visible to the naked eye. Recognizing that Escherichia coli holds high relevance within both environmental and clinical environments, an E. coli&#8208;responsive DNAzyme is incorporated into this platform. Through the optimization of the hydrogel polymerization process and the discovery of bacteriophage&#8208;induced DNAzyme signal amplification, 101 CFU mL&#8722;1 E. coli is detected within real&#8208;world lake water samples. Subsequent pairing with an artificial intelligence model removed ambiguity in sensor readout, offering 96% true positive and 100% true negative accuracy. Finally, high sensor specificity and stability results supported clinical use, where 100% of urine samples collected from patients with E. coli urinary tract infections are accurately identified. No false positives are observed when testing healthy samples. Ultimately, this platform stands to significantly improve population health by substantially increasing pathogen testing accessibility.

Ultimately, this platform stands to significantly improve population health by substantially increasing pathogen testing accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multilevel Optical Storage, Dynamic Light Modulation, and Polarization Control in Filamented Memristor System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes a multifunction metallic filamented memristor offering wavelength&#8208;dependent optical storage, light modulation, and polarization control. The optical readout of the structure's state provides more accurate information than electrical measurements, enabling the recovery of the complete record of applied voltages even in the presence of stochastic filament breaks. Spectroscopic ellipsometry gives real&#8208;time insights into cation dynamics and permittivity changes.








Abstract
The electrochemical metallization (ECM) mechanism is emerging as a promising approach for the development of optical memristors&#8212;nonvolatile memory systems proposed for use as artificial synapses in neuromorphic computing applications. ECM memristors offer exceptional operating dynamics and power efficiency compared to other systems, but challenges with reproducible cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle state switching and the absence of advanced optical functionalities hinder their integration into photonic systems. In this work, an ECM free&#8208;standing memristor structure is proposed, which simultaneously offers wavelength&#8208;dependent multilevel nonvolatile optical storage, volatile light modulation, and dynamic polarization control. It is demonstrated that in the presence of a resonance, the optical readout provides noise&#8208;free, robust, and significantly more accurate information about the memristor's state than electrical measurement. The use of light allows to gain insight into the intermediate electrical levels of the device as it transitions between high and low resistance states and to recover the complete record of applied voltages even when stochastic filament ruptures occur. Finally, the investigations show that spectroscopic ellipsometry provides real&#8208;time information on the dynamics of cation movement and the corresponding permittivity changes at the interfaces between the switching layer and the electrodes, thus becoming a complementary characterization method for ECM memristors alongside state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques.

         <title>Screening Fluorination Additives for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep investigation is conducted to evaluate the impact of diverse fluorinated additives on the domain distribution within the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite. By utilizing the fluorinated additive with minimal dipole moment, the undesirable small&#8208;n domain is successfully inhibited, which enables the fabrication of efficient PeLED with an impressive EQE of 20.38% at 488&#160;nm.








Abstract
Fluorinated additives are proposed to address the issue of domain polydispersity in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. However, the lack of established screening criteria for these additives necessitates a laborious and costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process. Herein, this work explores the behind nature for the first time how various fluorination in fluorinated additives affect domain distribution in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The studies reveal that fully fluorinated additives could suppress undesirable low&#8208;dimensional domains, facilitating efficient energy transfer, while partially fluorinated additives adversely cause deteriorated optical properties. The observed trend is ascribed to the molecular dipole moment of the fluorinated additives, offering a reasonable explanation for experimental phenomena that has never been reported before. By employing fully fluorinated additives, the fabricated sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) deliver a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.38% (@488&#160;nm), marking as one of the highest efficiencies reported to date. The finding provides a screening criterion for fluorinated additives to realize efficient PeLEDs.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Electrical Synergetic Control of Non&#8208;Volatile States in Bilayer Graphene&#8208;CrOCl Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores the effect of chromium oxychloride (CrOCl) spin states on bilayer graphene (BLG) using capacitance measurements. A unique hysteretic behavior in charging states is observed, influenced by magnetization history, not electrical gating. This behavior can be electrically controlled. First&#8208;principles calculations show it results from charge transfer during CrOCl's phase transition, offering new insights for 2D device design.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;ferromagnetic insulator chromium oxychloride (CrOCl) has shown peculiar charge transfer and correlation&#8208;enhanced emerging properties when interfaced with other van der Waals conductive channels. However, the influence of its spin states to the channel material remains largely unknown. Here, this issue is addressed by directly measuring the density of states in bilayer graphene (BLG) interfaced with CrOCl via a high&#8208;precision capacitance measurement technique and a surprising hysteretic behavior in the charging states of the heterostructure is observed. Such hysteretic behavior depends only on the history of magnetization, but not on the history of electrical gating; it can also be turned off electrically, providing a synergetic control of these non&#8208;volatile states. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute this observation to magnetic field&#8208;controlled charge transfer between BLG and CrOCl during the phase transition of CrOCl from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferrimagnetic&#8208;like (FiM) states. This magnetic&#8208;electrical synergetic control mechanism broadens the scope of proximity effects and opens new possibilities for the design of advanced 2D heterostructures and devices.

         <title>Molecular Design of a Diketopyrrolopyrrole Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Capable of Imaging Intracellular Vesicle Membrane Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study designs a novel lipid bilayer probe, COE&#8208;KP, that features record fluorogenic characteristics and responsiveness to protic environments through acceptor modulation within the conjugated oligoelectrolyte backbone. COE&#8208;KP is capable of differentiating between cells of different growth states based on its fluorescence lifetime. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging using COE&#8208;KP also enables direct visualization of intracellular vesicle membrane structures.








Abstract
Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are lipid bilayer spanning optical reporters that hold promise for delineating spatiotemporal changes in subcellular compartments. However, their ability to probe a broader range of biological processes remains restricted due to the lack of environmentally&#8208;responsive chemical functionalities. Herein, the study reports a novel COE, namely COE&#8208;KP, for monitoring spatiotemporal changes in the endolysosomal vesicles. COE&#8208;KP features a central diketopyrrolopyrrole functional group in the optically active conjugated core that confers photophysical properties suitable for bioimaging, in particular responding to the presence of hydrogen bonding functionalities within the hydrophobic domain of the lipid bilayer. COE&#8208;KP can thus discriminate cells in different growth states through two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with excitation in the NIR&#8208;II range. These changes in lifetime most reasonably reflect the degree of water permeability through the membrane and are not linked to notable differences in membrane tension or solvent polarity. Furthermore, using stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy, it is possible to directly visualize membrane&#8208;bound COEs within cellular vesicles. These results illustrate further opportunities for applying COE&#8208;based reporters for super&#8208;resolution microscopy of organelle membranes, visualization of subcellular membrane morphologies, and imaging long&#8208;term changes in membrane properties.

C&#8208;2PACz&#8208;based thermally evaporated sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs obtains a champion EQE of 10.41% @65.59 cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work provides new insights into design strategies for dual&#8208;function SAMs to achieve higher performance in PeLEDs.








Abstract
Thermally evaporated perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold immense potential for future applications in the display industry. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs is far behind, one of the most important reasons is the lack of suitable hole&#8208;transporting materials. Herein, the study designs and synthesizes a new class of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) materials, namely, (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;formylphenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (C&#8208;2PACz) and (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid&#160;(S&#8208;2PACz). First, the phosphonic acid is induced to form bidentate bonds with ITO. Second, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are integrated to increase the electron cloud density of the termini contacting with perovskite, which enhances the electrostatic interaction with the Pb2+, reduces the interfacial defects. These advantages improve their carrier transport ability and reduce the non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface. Meanwhile, it is found that compound C&#8208;2PACz possessing the smaller steric hindrance makes the SAMs have a&#160;more homogeneous film and a&#160;better interfacial passivation effect. By employing C&#8208;2PACz as hole&#8208;transporting layer in blue PeLEDs with metal halides as the emitting layer, the device exhibits a high brightness (1843&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2) and a maximum external quantum efficiency (10.41% @65.59&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), which among the best of reported thermally evaporated sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs. The work provides new insights into design strategies for dual&#8208;function SAMs to achieve higher performance in PeLEDs.

         <title>An Oral PROTAC Targeting HPK1 Degradation Potentiates Anti&#8208;Solid Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oral PROTAC is developed to potentiate the immune response by targeting the degradation of HPK1 in T cells. Conveniently modifiable in dose and duration of administration, the oral PROTAC provides a promising tool for CAR&#8208;T cell&#8208; and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody&#8208;mediated immunotherapy for treating cancers such as cervical and colon cancers.








Abstract
Hematopoietic progenitor pinase1 (HPK1) knockout has been identified as an efficient route to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Here, this work develops an oral proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) targeting HPK1 to efficiently and selectively degrade HPK1 to augment immunotherapeutic outcomes. In a postoperative tumor model of human cervical cancer in NSG mice, the orally&#8208;administrated PROTAC can reach tumors, down&#8208;regulate HPK1 levels in locally&#8208;administrated CAR&#8208;T cells, and promote their efficiency in inhibiting solid tumor recurrence, achieving 50% partial response (PR) and 50% complete response (CR). In addition, oral administration of PROTAC can amplify the suppression capability of the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody on the growth of CT26 solid tumors in BALB/c mice by promoting the infiltration of CD45&#8208;positive immune cells from 0.7% to 1.5% and CD3&#8208;positive T cells from 0.2% to 0.5% within the tumors.

Abstract
Humidity sensors are vital for ambient monitoring, but existing sensors focus on moisture absorption, overlooking the indispensable role of ion channels in the water&#8208;electricity conversion process. Here, an ultra&#8208;miniaturized fiber humidity (MFH) sensor based on near&#8208;parallel ion pathways is presented. The well&#8208;designed nanochannels significantly facilitate ion transport due to the stable charge distribution and the confined ions migration within near&#8208;parallel nanostructure, which improves the water&#8208;electricity conversion efficiency of moisture&#8208;sensitive fibers. Optimized nanochannels enable the MFH sensor to improve the response/recovery speed by &#8776;5 times compared to the disordered nanochannels. Additionally, the MFH sensor can be woven for ultra&#8208;miniaturization (0.50 mm2), which is much smaller than current sensors. Therefore, the integrated MFH sensor array demonstrated exceptionally high spatial resolution (sensor density of 1 mm&#8722;1), highlighting its potential in flexible wearables. This work provides new optimization strategies and assembly means for designing the high&#8208;performance humidity sensors of the next generation.

         <title>Design Principles for Enhancing Both Carrier Mobility and Stretchability in Polymer Semiconductors via Lewis Acid Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the molecular interactions between the host polymer and Lewis acid dopants, offering an effective strategy to simultaneously enhance the carrier mobility and stretchability of polymer semiconductors. Optimizing lamellar stacking distance and reducing crystallinity promote the dispersion of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane within the side&#8208;chain regions. Reducing the strength of Lewis base groups in the polymer prevents the formation of excessively strong Lewis acid&#8208;base complexes, thus maintaining chain flexibility.








Abstract
With the rise of skin&#8208;like electronics, devices are increasingly coming into close contact with the human body, creating a demand for polymer semiconductors (PSCs) that combine stretchability with reliable electrical performance. However, balancing mechanical robustness with high carrier mobility remains a challenge. To address this, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) for Lewis acid doping is proposed to improve charge mobility while enhancing stretchability by increasing structural disorder. Through systematic investigation, several key structural principles have been identified to maximize the effectiveness of BCF doping in stretchable PSCs. Notably, increasing the lamellar stacking distance and reducing crystallinity facilitate the incorporation of BCF into the alkyl side&#8208;chain regions, thereby enhancing both mobility and stretchability. Conversely, stronger Lewis base groups in the main chain negatively impact these improvements. These results demonstrate that with a small addition of BCF, a two&#8208;fold increase in carrier mobility is achieved while simultaneously enhancing the crack onset strain to 100%. Furthermore, doped PSCs exhibit stable mobility retention under repeated 30% strains over 1000 cycles. This method of decoupling carrier mobility from mechanical properties opens up new avenues in the search for high&#8208;mobility stretchable PSCs.

         <title>A High&#8208;Stability Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Implantable Memristor for Pulmonary Hypertension Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the potential of implantable memristors with Ag/MnO2/BaTiO3/FTO structure for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. It shows excellent stability and biocompatibility, providing new inspiration for the design of efficient, real&#8208;time, and reliable implantable pressure monitoring device in medical health monitoring.








Abstract
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) significantly affects the quality of life and lifespan of humans and has promoted the development of flexible implantable electronic devices for PH diagnosis and prevention. Traditional implantable devices based on the von Neumann architecture face insurmountable challenges in processing large amounts of biological data due to computational bottlenecks. Memristors, with integrated in&#8208;memory sensing and computing capabilities, can effectively eliminate computational bottlenecks and become one of the most promising products in implantable devices for health monitoring. Here, a memristor with the Ag/MnO2/BaTiO3/FTO structure is implemented and implanted into Sprague&#8210;Dawley (SD) rats. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) packaging, the device can be continuously worked in vivo for up to four weeks, demonstrating excellent stability and biocompatibility. Furthermore, a memristive sensor array is designed for pulmonary artery blood pressure monitoring based on the pressure&#8208;responsive characteristics of the as&#8208;prepared memristive device. The front&#8208;end memristive sensor array can collect and feedback pressure signal, while noise reduction is achieved through memristive logic circuits, and ultimately the memristor neural network processes and classifies the information. Therefore, this work demonstrates the potential of implantable memristors for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring and provides new inspiration for the design of efficient, real&#8208;time, and reliable implantable pressure monitoring devices in medical health monitoring.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension (PH) significantly affects the quality of life and lifespan of humans and has promoted the development of flexible implantable electronic devices for PH diagnosis and prevention. Traditional implantable devices based on the von Neumann architecture face insurmountable challenges in processing large amounts of biological data due to computational bottlenecks. Memristors, with integrated in-memory sensing and computing capabilities, can effectively eliminate computational bottlenecks and become one of the most promising products in implantable devices for health monitoring. Here, a memristor with the Ag/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/FTO structure is implemented and implanted into Sprague&#8210;Dawley (SD) rats. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) packaging, the device can be continuously worked in vivo for up to four weeks, demonstrating excellent stability and biocompatibility. Furthermore, a memristive sensor array is designed for pulmonary artery blood pressure monitoring based on the pressure-responsive characteristics of the as-prepared memristive device. The front-end memristive sensor array can collect and feedback pressure signal, while noise reduction is achieved through memristive logic circuits, and ultimately the memristor neural network processes and classifies the information. Therefore, this work demonstrates the potential of implantable memristors for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring and provides new inspiration for the design of efficient, real-time, and reliable implantable pressure monitoring devices in medical health monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Doping Ti into RuO2 to Accelerate Bridged&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Deprotonation for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing an additional proton acceptor is essential for achieving rapid deprotonation kinetics of oxo intermediates during acidic oxygenevolution reaction (OER). In this work, the construction of a RuTiOx solid solution optimizes proton adsorption energy at Obri sites, thereby activating an Obri&#8208;assisted deprotonation mechanism. Consequently, RuTiOx exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for OER.








Abstract
The development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for advancing renewable hydrogen energy technology. However, the slow deprotonation kinetics of oxo&#8208;intermediates, involving the four proton&#8208;coupled electron steps, hinder the acidic OER progress. Herein, a RuTiOx solid solution electrocatalyst is investigated, which features bridged oxygen (Obri) sites that act as proton acceptors, accelerating the deprotonation of oxo&#8208;intermediates. Electrochemical tests, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory results reveal that the moderate proton adsorption energy on Obri sites facilitates fast deprotonation kinetics through the adsorbate evolution mechanism. This process effectively prevents the over&#8208;oxidation and deactivation of Ru sites caused by the lattice oxygen mechanism. Consequently, RuTiOx shows a low overpotential of 198&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2geo and performance exceeding 1400&#160;h at 50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2geo with negligible deactivation. These insights into the OER mechanism and the structure&#8208;function relationship are crucial for the advancement of catalytic systems.

         <title>Optimizing Si&#9472;O Conjugation to Enhance Interfacial Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic molecular bond design has led to the identification of siloxanes as novel low&#8208;temperature solvents for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The d&#8208;p conjugation of the Si&#9472;O bond enhances voltage resistance and weakens Li+&#8208;solvent interactions.








Abstract
With the growing demand for high&#8208;voltage and wide&#8208;temperature range applications of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), the requirements for electrolytes have become increasingly stringent. While fluorination engineering has enhanced the performance of traditional solvent systems, it has also raised concerns regarding cost, environmental hazards, and low reduction stability. Through strategic molecular bond design, a novel class of low&#8208;temperature (LT) solvents&#8212;siloxanes&#8212;is identified, meeting the demands of LT and high&#8208;voltage applications in LIBs. The d&#8208;p conjugation of the Si&#9472;O bond enhances voltage resistance and weakens the Li+&#8208;solvent interactions. By modulating the number of Si&#9472;O conjugated bonds, the type of anion clusters in the solvation structure can be controlled, ultimately leading to the formation of a LiF and Si&#9472;O&#8208;rich interfacial layer and facilitating rapid Li+ conduction. Consequently, the graphite||NCM811 pouch cell (2.3 Ah, 4.45 V) with a siloxane&#8208;based electrolyte retains 75.1% of room temperature capacity (RTC) at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. The rapid interface kinetics allow a superior reversible charging capacity retention of 67.6% at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, with good cycle stability at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This study provides new insights into solvent design to fortify LIB performance in harsh conditions.

A novel formulation referred to water&#8208;stable magnetic lipiodol micro&#8208;droplets (MLMD) possesses properties such as flowability, shape adaptability, efficient drug loading, and compatibility with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) imaging is presented.

Abstract
Magnetic microrobots, designed to navigate the complex environments of the human body, show promise for minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment. However, their clinical adoption faces hurdles such as biocompatibility, precise control, and intelligent tracking. Here a novel formulation (referred to water&#8208;stable magnetic lipiodol micro&#8208;droplets, MLMD), integrating clinically approved lipiodol, gelatin, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) with a fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationships is presented. This formulation demonstrates multiple improved properties including flowability, shape adaptability, efficient drug loading, and compatibility with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) imaging in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This enables the MLMD as a versatile tool for image&#8208;guided therapy, supported by a close&#8208;looped magnetic navigation system featuring artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven visual feedback for autonomous control. The system effectively performs navigational tasks, including pinpointing specific locations of MLMD, recognizing and avoiding obstacles, mapping and following predetermined paths, and utilizing magnetic fields for precise motion planning to achieve visual drug delivery. The MLMD combines magnetic actuation with an AI&#8208;directed close&#8208;looped navigation, offering a transformative platform for targeted therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Vertical Graphene&#8208;Based Multiparametric Sensing Array for Integration of Smart Catheter to Electrochemically Monitor Peritoneal Dialysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical graphene&#8208;based multiparametric sensing array (VG&#8208;MSA) developed for smart catheter integration to electrochemically monitor peritoneal dialysis. Vertical graphene electrode with good electrochemical properties serves as a core module to develop a miniatured sensing array&#160;with sufficient electrochemical performance. The VG&#8208;MSA enabled sensitive and multiplexed measurement of dialysate components, realizing in situ, real&#8208;time, and continuous biochemical information collection during peritoneal dialysis.








Abstract
Renal failure is typical chronic kidney disease that required peritoneal dialysis as the primary treatment, but current catheter devices lack functionality to monitor changes in chemical analytes during peritoneal dialysis. Fabrication of miniatured sensing modules with good electrochemical performance in tiny catheter devices is the key to realize the smart monitoring of peritoneal dialysis. In this work, a vertical graphene&#8208;based multiparametric sensing array (VG&#8208;MSA) is developed to continuously measure fluctuations of various analyte concentrations for peritoneal dialysis monitoring. Vertical graphene (VG) electrode with good electrochemical properties serves as the core module in VG&#8208;MSA, allowing the development of miniatured sensing modules with sufficient electrochemical performance. The VG&#8208;MSA enables sensitive and multiplexed measurement of dialysate components like metabolites (reactive oxygen species, uric acid, and glucose) and ions (K+, Ca2+, and H+). The VG&#8208;MSA is demonstrated to effectively detect biochemical signals in peritoneal dialysate in vivo on rat models. The VG&#8208;MSA catheter can be inserted into abdominal cavity, allowing full contact with dialysate for in situ, real&#8208;time, and continuous collection of biochemical information during peritoneal dialysis. The VG&#8208;MSA catheter device offers a valuable tool for monitoring dialysis quality and facilitating treatment adjustments, potentially as a promising platform for high&#8208;quality therapy of renal failure.

The VG-MSA is demonstrated to effectively detect biochemical signals in peritoneal dialysate in vivo on rat models. The VG-MSA catheter can be inserted into abdominal cavity, allowing full contact with dialysate for in situ, real-time, and continuous collection of biochemical information during peritoneal dialysis. The VG-MSA catheter device offers a valuable tool for monitoring dialysis quality and facilitating treatment adjustments, potentially as a promising platform for high-quality therapy of renal failure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4H&#8208;SiC Metalens: Mitigating Thermal Drift Effect in High&#8208;Power Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic 4H&#8208;SiC metalens with exceptional thermal stability is applied in high&#8208;power laser applications, achieving diffraction&#8208;limited focusing (NA 0.5, focal length 1 cm). After 1 h of 15W, 1030 nm pulsed laser irradiation, it exhibits only a 3.2&#160;&#176;C temperature rise and a 14 &#181;m focal shift. Cutting 4H&#8208;SiC wafers results in just an 11.4% depth change, marking a significant advance for high&#8208;power laser systems and expanding their application potential.








Abstract
Enhancing energy density and efficiency in laser processing hinges on precise beam focusing, yet this often causes severe heat absorption and focus shifts in optical lenses. Traditional cooling methods increase cost and complexity, severely limiting versatility. Here, monolithic silicon carbide (SiC) metalens is introduced, which shows unparalleled thermal stability, integrated with a high&#8208;power laser. This metalens achieves diffraction&#8208;limited focusing with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.5 and a focal length of 1&#160;cm. Under a 1030&#160;nm pulsed laser at 15&#160;W for 1 h, it shows a minimal temperature rise of 3.2&#160;&#176;C and a tiny focal shift of 14&#160;&#181;m (0.1% relative), only 6% of the shift in conventional lenses. When used to cut a 4H&#8208;SiC substrate with the same laser, the metalens exhibit only an 11.4% change in cutting depth after 1 h of operation, correlating with the focal shift results. The results unveil a groundbreaking class of compact SiC photonics devices nearly impervious to heat absorption, representing a monumental leap for high&#8208;power laser systems and opening new horizons for their applications and efficiency.

         <title>Synergistic Degradation of Durable Polymer Networks by Light and Acid Enabled by Pyrenylsilicon Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant advancement in resolving the incompatibility between photodegradablity and photostability of polymer materials is reported by developing a novel cleavage reaction of the C&#8211;Si bond under simultaneous exposure to light and acid. The synergistic activation of polymer materials can be applied to a wide range of materials, including color&#8208;tunable optical materials, tough elastic materials, and additive/subtractive 3D&#8208;photoprinting materials.








Abstract
Material photocontrol has gained importance in process engineering and biomedical applications. However, highly photoreactive materials are intrinsically unstable to light, which limits their continuous use in lit environments owing to their gradual deterioration. Herein, synergistically photocontrollable materials in the presence of acid are developed to overcome the conventional trade&#8208;off between their photoreactivity and photostability. Pyrenylsilicon derivatives are designed as synergistically cleavable moieties on C&#8211;Si bonds under simultaneous treatment with light and acid through photoinduced dearomatization and protonation to generate the Wheland intermediate, whereas the derivatives are highly stable to light or acid alone. The unique reactivity of pyrenylsilicon derivatives is applied to various polymer network crosslinkers, enabling synergistic control and degradation of materials with light and acids. Because of their high photostability in the absence of acids, these materials can be utilized as optical materials, robust elastomers, and 3D photoprinted gels.

         <title>Hyaluronic Acid&#8208;Nanocoated Bacteria Generate an Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Tissue&#8208;Repair Effect in Impaired Gut and Extraintestinal Organs</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanocoating Clostridium butyricum with hyaluronic acid is reported to develop a dual&#8208;functionality and dual&#8208;location intervention strategy, which can attenuate intestinal mucosal inflammation and recover gut barrier integrity, as well as alleviate interstitial inflammation and pathological damage of extraintestinal organs via remodeling microbial metabolites and decreasing microbial translocation. This work proposes a type of next&#8208;generation living therapeutics for treating extraintestinal diseases.








Abstract
Diverse extraintestinal diseases are characterized by localized inflammatory responses and tissue damage, accompanied with intestinal inflammation and injury. Here, a dual&#8208;functionality and dual&#8208;location intervention strategy is reported, which is the use of hyaluronic acid&#8208;nanocoated Clostridium butyricum to generate an anti&#8208;inflammatory tissue&#8208;repair effect in the impaired gut and extraintestinal organs. Nanocoated bacteria attenuate intestinal mucosal inflammation and recover gut barrier integrity by leveraging the immunosuppressive nature of hyaluronic acid and the butyrate&#8208;producing ability of Clostridium butyricum. Nanocoated bacteria also alleviate the interstitial inflammation and pathological damage of extraintestinal organs via remodeling microbial metabolites and decreasing microbial translocation. In murine models of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, oral delivery of nanocoated bacteria demonstrates the potency to restore renal function and eliminate renal fibrosis. This work proposes a type of next&#8208;generation living therapeutics for treating extraintestinal diseases.

         <dc:description>
A new treatment using a polymer&#8208;formulated nerve growth factor that can cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier, which effectively reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, reshaped microglia polarization at infarct sites, and decreased the overall microinfarct burden, leading to improvements in behavioral and cognitive functions in a mouse model. This work provides a promising new therapeutic for cerebral microinfarcts and other neurodegeneration diseases.








Abstract
Cerebral microinfarcts represent the most prevalent form of ischemic brain injury in the elderly, particularly among those suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular risk factors. Despite their commonality, effective treatments have remained elusive. Herein, a novel treatment utilizing a polymer&#8208;formulated nerve growth factor capable of crossing the blood&#8208;brain barrier is reported, which effectively reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, reshaped microglia polarization at infarct sites, and decreased the overall microinfarct burden, leading to notable improvements in behavioral and cognitive functions in a mouse model. This work provides a promising new avenue for the treatment of cerebral microinfarcts and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Eutectogel with Cell Permeation and Multiple Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Abilities for Treating Chronic Periodontitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article fabricates an injectable eutectogel via self&#8208;assembly of ChCl/M DES, gallic acid, and lysozyme fibers. The eutectogels exhibit the potential to enhance the efficacy if treatments/therapies against inflammatory diseases by facilitating bacterial control, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and the regulation of macrophages by promoting cell permeation of small&#8208;molecule drugs.








Abstract
Eutectogels represent an attractive option for various industrial applications that use deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as effective liquid active ingredients and offer remarkable stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, the biological applications of these compounds are limited. DESs are highly structurally tunable and exhibit remarkable biofunctionality and biocompatibility, conferring substantial benefits in the treatment of diseases. In this study, choline&#8208;chloride and mannose are used to fabricate ChCl/M DES, followed by introduction of lysozyme fibers and gallic acid for self&#8208;assembly into injectable eutectogels through hydrogen bonding and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction interactions.

&lt;p&gt;This article fabricates an injectable eutectogel via self-assembly of ChCl/M DES, gallic acid, and lysozyme fibers. The eutectogels exhibit the potential to enhance the efficacy if treatments/therapies against inflammatory diseases by facilitating bacterial control, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and the regulation of macrophages by promoting cell permeation of small-molecule drugs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eutectogels represent an attractive option for various industrial applications that use deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as effective liquid active ingredients and offer remarkable stability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, the biological applications of these compounds are limited. DESs are highly structurally tunable and exhibit remarkable biofunctionality and biocompatibility, conferring substantial benefits in the treatment of diseases. In this study, choline-chloride and mannose are used to fabricate ChCl/M DES, followed by introduction of lysozyme fibers and gallic acid for self-assembly into injectable eutectogels through hydrogen bonding and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction interactions. The eutectogels demonstrate almost 100% bactericidal activities against three strains and significant immune-regulation. This is supported by a decrease in the proportion of CD86-expressing cells from 64.02% to 18.17% and an increase in CD206-expressing cells from 2.53% to 29.96% through flow cytometry experiments. The eutectogels effectively inhibit alveolar bone loss and alleviated local inflammation in a rat model of chronic periodontitis owing to the promotion of gallic acid in the cell membrane by the ChCl/M DES. Hence, self-assembled eutectogels exhibit the potential to enhance the efficacy if treatments/therapies against inflammatory diseases by facilitating bacterial control, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and the regulation of macrophages by promoting cell permeation of small-molecule drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The researchers successfully synthesized a novel cathode material, T#2&#8208;Li0.69CoO2. Owing to the unique Li&#9472;O tetrahedral coordination structure and the dominant cobalt oxidation under high voltage, T#2&#8208;Li0.69CoO2 delivers an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 258 mAh g&#8722;1, close to the theoretical capacity, thereby exhibiting a record&#8208;high volumetric energy density of up to 4410 Wh L&#8722;1 among all reported cathodes.








Abstract
Efficient utilization of resources is crucial for the sustainable development of the lithium&#8208;ion battery industry. Although the traditional R3&#175;$\bar{3}$m space group LiCoO2 can provide a current advanced discharge capacity of 215&#8211;220 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at an upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V (relative to Li&#8314;/Li), it still falls far short of its theoretical specific capacity of 273 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, and exhibits structural instability and labile oxygen loss, leading to rapid capacity degradation. T#2&#8208;Li0.69CoO2 is synthesized with Cmca space group and Li&#9472;O tetrahedral coordination. Owing to the unique Li&#9472;O tetrahedral coordination structure and the dominant cobalt oxidation under high voltage, T#2&#8208;Li0.69CoO2 delivers an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 258 mAh g&#8722;1, close to the theoretical capacity, in liquid electrolyte batteries and 253 mAh g&#8722;1 in solid state batteries, overcoming the structural instability of layered oxide cathodes during charging and discharging processes. This study broadens the possibilities of creating high energy&#8208;density cathodes for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Breaking the Mutual&#8208;Constraint of Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis via Direct O&#9472;O Coupling on High&#8208;Valence Ir Single&#8208;Atom on MnOx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mutual constraint of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalysis is ingenuously broken on a high&#8208;valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide bifunctional catalyst through direct O&#9472;O coupling, which shows independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e&#8722; pathway for ORR and a novel chemical&#8208;activated concerted mechanism for OER.









Abstract
Insufficient bifunctional activity of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major obstruction to the application of rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries. The primary reason is the mutual constraint of ORR and OER mechanism, involving the same oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and demonstrating the scaling limitations of the adsorption energies. Herein, it is reported a high&#8208;valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide (IrSA&#8208;MnOx) bifunctional catalyst showing independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e&#8722; pathway on high&#8208;valence Ir site for ORR and a novel chemical&#8208;activated concerted mechanism for OER, where a distinct spontaneous chemical activation process triggers direct O&#9472;O coupling. The IrSA&#8208;MnOx therefore delivers outstanding bifunctional activities with remarkably low potential difference (0.635&#160;V) between OER potential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and ORR half&#8208;wave potential in alkaline solution. This work breaks the scaling limitations and provides a new avenue to design efficient and multifunctional electrocatalysts.

         <title>Programmable Shape&#8208;Morphing Enables Ceramic Meta&#8208;Aerogel Highly Stretchable for Thermal Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel with a binary cellular structure, combining anisotropic lamellated aerogel (grid section) and isotropic random aerogel (mesh section), is fabricated using kirigami stacking and subsequent nanofiber freeze&#8208;drying techniques. This specific topological structure design enables the meta&#8208;aerogel robust structure, highly elastic tensile deformation, exceptional fatigue resistance for tensile, compressive, and buckling cycles, temperature&#8208;invariant superelastic, superior thermal insulation; and these properties make it a potential application for exploring thermal protective materials.








Abstract
Ceramic aerogels hold significant potential for thermal insulation, yet their mechanical stretchability and thermal stability fall short in extreme environments. Here, the study presents a programmable shape&#8208;morphing strategy aimed at engineering a binary network topology structure within ceramic aerogels to effectively dissipate stress and block heat transfer. The special topology design, which includes kirigami lamellated aerogels for bearing loading stress and randomly assembled aerogels for mechanical energy pre&#8208;storage to transfer tensile stress, effectively achieves unexpected mechanical tensile properties and thermal stability. The resulting robust meta&#8208;aerogels demonstrate remarkable structural stability with topology&#8208;derived mechanical tensile of up to 85% strain, excellent resilience to 500 cycles of 50% tensile strain, 1000 cycles of 60% buckling strain, and 500 cycles of 50% compressive strain, temperature&#8208;invariant tensile recovery capability; simultaneously, low thermal conductivity of 33.01&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 and tensile&#8208;invariant thermal insulation makes the ceramic meta&#8208;aerogels an ideal substitute material for various applications.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Control of the Local Thermal Conductivity in Charge Transfer Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;volatile thermal states can be written on the surface of Fe and Co oxides by conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) lithography. Spatially resolved Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)&#160;demonstrates an excellent control over the local thermal conductivity, with reductions up to 50%, controlled by the applied electric field.









Abstract
Phonons, the collective excitations responsible for heat transport in crystalline insulating solids, lack electric charge or magnetic moment, which complicates their active control via external fields. This presents a significant challenge in designing thermal equivalents of basic electronic circuit elements, such as transistors or diodes. Achieving these goals requires precise and reversible modification of thermal conductivity in materials. In this work, the continuous tuning of local thermal conductivity in charge&#8208;transfer SrFeO3&#8208;x and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8208;x oxides using a voltage&#8208;biased Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)&#160;tip at room temperature is demonstrated. This method allows the creation of micron&#8208;sized domains with well&#8208;defined thermal conductivity, achieving reductions of up to 50%, measured by spatially resolved Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR). By optimizing the oxide's chemical composition, the thermal states remain stable under normal atmospheric conditions but can be reverted to their original values through thermal annealing in air. A comparison between Mott&#8211;Hubbard and charge&#8208;transfer oxides reveals the critical role of redox&#8208;active lattice oxygen in ensuring full reversibility of the process. This approach marks a significant step toward fabricating oxide&#8208;based tunable microthermal resistances and other elements for thermal circuits.

&lt;p&gt;Non-volatile thermal states can be written on the surface of Fe and Co oxides by conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) lithography. Spatially resolved Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)&#160;demonstrates an excellent control over the local thermal conductivity, with reductions up to 50%, controlled by the applied electric field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phonons, the collective excitations responsible for heat transport in crystalline insulating solids, lack electric charge or magnetic moment, which complicates their active control via external fields. This presents a significant challenge in designing thermal equivalents of basic electronic circuit elements, such as transistors or diodes. Achieving these goals requires precise and reversible modification of thermal conductivity in materials. In this work, the continuous tuning of local thermal conductivity in charge-transfer SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; and La&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; oxides using a voltage-biased Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)&#160;tip at room temperature is demonstrated. This method allows the creation of micron-sized domains with well-defined thermal conductivity, achieving reductions of up to 50%, measured by spatially resolved Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR). By optimizing the oxide's chemical composition, the thermal states remain stable under normal atmospheric conditions but can be reverted to their original values through thermal annealing in air. A comparison between Mott&#8211;Hubbard and charge-transfer oxides reveals the critical role of redox-active lattice oxygen in ensuring full reversibility of the process. This approach marks a significant step toward fabricating oxide-based tunable microthermal resistances and other elements for thermal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Piezoelectricity in Amino Acids by Fluorination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high piezoelectric amino acid (Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F)) is designed by simple fluorination. Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) self&#8208;assembles into single crystals with C2 space group. Importantly, Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) crystals serve as a flexible piezoelectric sensor for the classification of various nuts and their quality sorting, which includes those as small as individual pumpkin seeds with high sensitivity and accuracy of sorting and quality checks.









Abstract
Bioinspired piezoelectric amino acids and peptides are attracting attention due to their designable sequences, versatile structures, low cost, and biodegradability. However, it remains a challenge to design amino acids and peptides with high piezoelectricity. Herein, a high piezoelectric amino acid by simple fluorination in its side chain is presented. The three phenylalanine derivatives are designed: Cbz&#8208;Phe, Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F), and Cbz&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;Phe. The effect of fluorination on self&#8208;assembly and piezoelectricity is investigated. Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) can self&#8208;assemble into crystals with a C2 space group, while Cbz&#8208;Phe and Cbz&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;Phe form aggregated self&#8208;assemblies. Moreover, Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) crystals exhibit a remarkably higher piezoelectric coefficient (d33eff$d_{\ 33}^{\ eff}$) of &#8776;17.9 pm V&#8722;1 than Cbz&#8208;Phe and Cbz&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;Phe. When fabricated as a piezoelectric nanogenerator, it generates an open&#8208;circuit voltage of &#8776;2.4 V. Importantly, Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) crystals serve as a flexible piezoelectric sensor for the classification of various nuts and their quality sorting, which includes those as small as individual pumpkin seeds with high sensitivity and accuracy of sorting and quality checks. When mounted onto soft grippers, the sensor performs the tactile self&#8208;sensing functions. This work provides a promising approach to designing high piezoelectric amino acids by simple fluorination, offering exciting prospects for advancements in bioinspired piezoelectric materials in the application of smart agriculture and soft robotics.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Protein Induced in Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptide Drugs for Synergistic Mitochondria Disruption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX, a peptide nanomaterial that self&#8208;assembles into spherical structures within cells, addressing the impact of the tumor's intrinsic repair mechanisms on therapeutic efficacy. RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX not only damages mitochondria but also stably inhibits MUC1&#8208;C dimerization, blocking the repair of stress&#8208;induced mitochondrial damage in tumor cells. RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX can treat tumors while simultaneously inhibiting tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted cancer therapy is an effective method for controlling tumor growth. However, the presence of repair mechanisms in tumor cells in response to mitochondrial damage poses significant challenges for treatment. By taking advantage of intracellular self&#8208;assembly technology, a peptide nanomaterial, RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX, that enters tumor cells in a monomeric form is designed. After binding to MUC1&#8208;C inside the cell membrane, RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX assembles into a spherical structure that stably encapsulates MUC1&#8208;C, inhibiting its dimerization and blocking the repair of stress&#8208;induced mitochondrial damage in tumor cells. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembled mitochondrial toxic peptide effectively destroys the mitochondria, and the loss of mitochondrial repair significantly increases tumor cytotoxicity by disrupting the redox balance, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting the nuclear factor (NF)&#8208;&#954;B pathway, and suppressing the epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. After intravenous administration, RC&#8208;G&#8208;FX accumulated at the tumor site, exhibiting improved anti&#8208;tumor effects and extending the overall survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Therefore, the integration of the in situ self&#8208;assembly of peptide drugs and damage to mitochondrial repair mechanisms provides effective therapeutic options for malignancy.

         <title>Multifunctional High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanolayer Toward Long&#8208;Life Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin high&#8208;entropy alloy (NbMoTaWV) interfacial layer is developed on commercial aluminum foil for anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries. The NbMoTaWV, characterized by enhanced sodiophilicity, abundant active sites, and plentiful nanoplates, significantly reduces Na nucleation barrier, accelerates interfacial reaction kinetics, and homogenizes electric field distribution. These improvements result in superior cycling stability, achieving over 300 cycles for the anode&#8208;free NbMoTaWV@Al||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) hold great promise due to high energy density and low cost. Unfortunately, their practical applications are hindered by poor cycling stability, which is attributed to Na dendrite growth and inferior Na plating/stripping reversibility on conventional sodiophobic current collectors. Here, a thin high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA, NbMoTaWV) interfacial layer composed of densely packed nanoplates is constructed on commercial aluminum foil (NbMoTaWV@Al) for AFSMBs. The enhanced sodiophilicity of the HEA greatly reduces Na nucleation barrier with low nucleation overpotential. Simultaneously, abundant active sites of the HEA can boost interfacial reaction kinetics and guide uniform Na deposition. Furthermore, plentiful HEA nanoplates can homogenize electric field distribution and decrease the local current density. Benefiting from the advantageous properties of NbMoTaWV@Al, outstanding electrochemical performances, including an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 1000 cycles at 2 mA cm&#8722;2/2 mAh cm&#8722;2 in asymmetric cells, alongside a small overpotential (10 mV at 1 mA cm&#8722;2) and a long lifespan of 2500 cycles in symmetric cells, are achieved. More impressively, the anode&#8208;free NbMoTaWV@Al||Na3V2(PO4)3 batteries display superior cycling stability over 300 cycles. This work presents an efficient method of employing multifunctional HEA materials to manipulate the interfacial properties of current collector for high&#8208;performance AFSMBs.

         <title>Photoreceptor&#8208;Like Signal Transduction Between Polymer&#8208;Based Protocells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents polymer&#8208;based protocells containing light&#8208;sensitive and catalytic artificial organelles (AOs), forming a communicating protocellular system. Light&#8208;triggered substrate release from AOs in sender protocells is used to relay a signal to a receiver protocell where its conversion takes place in catalytic AOs. This system, modulated by environmental calcium, can enhance the understanding of cellular communication networks.








Abstract
Deciphering inter&#8208; and intracellular signaling pathways is pivotal for understanding the intricate communication networks that orchestrate life's dynamics. Communication models involving bottom&#8208;up construction of protocells are emerging but often lack specialized compartments sufficiently robust and hierarchically organized to perform spatiotemporally defined signaling. Here, the modular construction of communicating polymer&#8208;based protocells designed to mimic the transduction of information in retinal photoreceptors is presented. Microfluidics is used to generate polymeric protocells subcompartmentalized by specialized artificial organelles. In one protocell population, light triggers artificial organelles with membrane&#8208;embedded photoresponsive rotary molecular motors to set off a sequence of reactions starting with the release of encapsulated signaling molecules into the lumen. Intercellular communication is mediated by signal transfer across membranes to protocells containing catalytic artificial organelles as subcompartments, whose signal conversion can be modulated by environmental calcium. Signal propagation also requires selective permeability of the diverse compartments. By segregating artificial organelles in distinct protocells, a sequential chain of reactions mediating intercellular communication is created that is further modulated by adding extracellular messengers. This connective behavior offers the potential for a deeper understanding of signaling pathways and faster integration of proto&#8208; and living cells, with the unique advantage of controlling each step by bio&#8208;relevant signals.

Communication models involving bottom-up construction of protocells are emerging but often lack specialized compartments sufficiently robust and hierarchically organized to perform spatiotemporally defined signaling. Here, the modular construction of communicating polymer-based protocells designed to mimic the transduction of information in retinal photoreceptors is presented. Microfluidics is used to generate polymeric protocells subcompartmentalized by specialized artificial organelles. In one protocell population, light triggers artificial organelles with membrane-embedded photoresponsive rotary molecular motors to set off a sequence of reactions starting with the release of encapsulated signaling molecules into the lumen. Intercellular communication is mediated by signal transfer across membranes to protocells containing catalytic artificial organelles as subcompartments, whose signal conversion can be modulated by environmental calcium. Signal propagation also requires selective permeability of the diverse compartments. By segregating artificial organelles in distinct protocells, a sequential chain of reactions mediating intercellular communication is created that is further modulated by adding extracellular messengers. This connective behavior offers the potential for a deeper understanding of signaling pathways and faster integration of proto- and living cells, with the unique advantage of controlling each step by bio-relevant signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spintronic Pathways in a Nonconjugated Radical Polymer Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonconjugated radical polymer with high spin density displays large effective spin mixing conductance, enabling efficient spin transport over long distances at room temperature.








Abstract
Radical chemistries have attracted burgeoning attention due to their intriguing technological applications in organic electronics, optoelectronics, and magneto&#8208;responsive systems. However, the potential of these magnetically active glassy polymers to transport spin&#8208;selective currents has not been demonstrated. Here, the spin&#8208;transport characteristics of the radical polymer poly(4&#8208;glycidyloxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl) (PTEO) allow for sustained spin&#8208;selective currents when incorporated into typical device geometries with magnetically polarized electrodes. Annealing thin films of PTEO above its glass transition temperature results in a giant magnetoresistance effect (i.e., an MR of &#8776;80%) at 4 K. Additionally, ferromagnetic resonance spin&#8208;pumping results in a relatively large effective spin&#8208;mixing conductance of 1.18 &#215; 1019 m&#8722;2 at the NiFe/PTEO interface. Due to the large spin&#8208;density and radical&#8208;radical exchange interactions, there is effective propagation of pure spin currents through PTEO in the NiFe/PTEO/Pd multilayer devices. This results in the transport of spin current over long distances with a spin diffusion length of 90.4 nm. The spin diffusion length and spin mixing conductance values surpass those reported in inorganic and metallic systems and are comparable to conventional doped conjugated polymers. This is the first example of spin transport in a nonconjugated radical polymer, and these findings underscore the promising spin&#8208;transporting potential of radical polymers.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Giant InP Quantum Dots with Stress&#8208;Released Morphological ZnSe&#8208;ZnSeS&#8208;ZnS Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium phosphide (InP) quantum dots (QDs) are promising alternatives to cadmium&#8208;based QDs, yet face stability challenges. This study presents a synthetic method for giant InP with morphological ZnSe/ZnSeS/ZnS shell with over 90% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). By addressing lattice mismatch strain, these giant QDs achieve improved stability, advancing future applications in eco&#8208;friendly displays and energy&#8208;efficient lighting.








Abstract
Indium phosphide (InP) quantum dots (QDs) are increasingly considered potent alternatives to traditional cadmium&#8208;based QDs. Notwithstanding, the material stability of InP, especially when juxtaposed with its cadmium&#8208;based counterparts, poses significant challenges in its application. Generally, a thick ZnS shell is applied to InP cores to thwart photo&#8208;oxidation and diminish nonradiative recombination. Yet, the pronounced lattice mismatch between the InP core and the ZnS shell can introduce lattice defects, consequently attenuating the luminescence efficiency. This makes the cultivation of a flawless thick shell a paramount challenge. In the present research, a synthetic methodology is elucidated to fabricate highly efficient InP QDs with dimensions exceeding 20&#160;nm, achieved by alleviating the lattice mismatch strain during the shell growth. By regulating the shell composition and morphology, InP/ZnSe/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with shield&#8208;like morphology are prepared and demonstrate a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8776;90%, exhibiting significantly enhanced photostability and thermal stability. This discovery is expected to greatly advance the preparation of highly efficient InP&#8208;based or other QDs, expanding their potential in various applications such as environmentally friendly displays and energy&#8208;saving lighting.

         <title>Bridging to Commercialization: Record&#8208;Breaking of Ultra&#8208;Large and Superior Cyclic Stability Tungsten Oxide Electrochromic Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance WO3&#8208;x&#183;nH2O films are prepared by the 2D black phosphorus&#8208;assisted in situ growth (TAIG) method. Record&#8208;breaking large&#8208;scale electrochromic smart windows are fabricated, exhibiting excellent electrochromic performance, including significant transmittance modulation, high coloration efficiency, and superior cyclic stability. This research marks a milestone in enhancing performance and industrial&#8208;scale production, bridging the gap to commercialization.








Abstract
Electrochromic smart windows (ESWs) can significantly reduce energy consumption in buildings, but their cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale production remains a challenge. In this study, the instability of black phosphorus is leveraged to induce the growth of the tungsten oxide film through its decomposition process, inspired by the 2D material&#8208;assisted in situ growth (TAIG) method. This approach results in the preparation of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance WO3&#8208;x&#183;nH2O (n&#160;&lt;&#160;2) films. Characterization techniques and DFT calculations confirm efficient regulation of&#160;structural water and oxygen vacancies during TAIG preparation. The WO3&#8208;x&#183;nH2O films exhibit excellent electrochromic (EC) properties, including high transmittance modulation (74.2%@1100&#160;nm), fast switching time (tc&#160;=&#160;5.5&#160;s, tb&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;s), high coloration efficiency (124.7&#160;cm2&#160;C&#8722;1), and superior cyclic stability (transmittance modulation retained 94.7% after 20&#160;000 cycles). Ultra&#8208;large&#160;WO3&#8208;x&#183;nH2O film are prepared via a simple immersion process, and fabricated into a large&#8208;area ESW under facile laboratory conditions, demonstrating the economic and practical feasibility of this approach in industrial&#8208;scale production. Operated by the intelligent control circuit,&#160; the ESW&#160;exhibits remarkable EC properties and cyclic stability This research represents a milestone in improving the performance and industrial&#8208;scale production of ESWs, bridging the gap to the commercialization of EC technology.

         <title>High Electrical Conductance in Magnetic Emission Junction of Fe3GeTe2/ZnO/Ni Heterostructure via Selective Spin Emission through ZnO Ohmic Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;conductance magnetic emission junction (MEJ) is demonstrated using an Fe&#8323;GeTe&#8322;/ZnO/Ni heterostructure, where the ZnO barrier forms an Ohmic contact, enabling free spin&#8208;electron emission. Unlike conventional magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs), the MEJ exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) through minority spin emission, achieving up to 10&#8211;1000 times higher conductance while maintaining a comparable MR ratio to other 2D&#8208;MTJs.








Abstract
The insulator is essential for magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) that increases magnetoresistance (MR) by decoupling magnetization directions between two ferromagnets. However, wide bandgap tunnel barrier blocks the thermionic emission of electrons, significantly reducing electrical conductance through MTJ. Here, a magnetic emission junction (MEJ) is demonstrated for the first time using an Fe3GeTe2 (FGT)/ZnO/Ni heterostructure with very high electrical conductance. The conduction band of ZnO (electron affinity 4.6&#160;eV) aligns with Fermi levels (EF) of FGT (4.47&#160;eV) and Ni (4.58&#160;eV) ferromagnets and forms an Ohmic barrier, enabling free spin&#8208;electron emission through ZnO barrier and high electrical conductance. In contrast to the typical positive MR in MTJ by majority spin tunneling, negative MR is observed in FGT/ZnO/Ni MEJ. The minority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states near the EF, are dominantly emitted to FGT over the ZnO barrier, while majority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states below the EF, are blocked by it. In the FGT/FGT/ZnO/Ni heterostructure, the MR ratio is further increased by combining positive and negative MR at the MTJ (FGT/FGT) and MEJ (FGT/ZnO/Ni), respectively. As a result, FGT&#8208;MEJ exhibits 10&#8211;1000 orders higher conductance than other 2D&#8208;MTJs, while MR ratio remains similar to other 2D&#8208;MTJs.

The conduction band of ZnO (electron affinity 4.6&#160;eV) aligns with Fermi levels (E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) of FGT (4.47&#160;eV) and Ni (4.58&#160;eV) ferromagnets and forms an Ohmic barrier, enabling free spin-electron emission through ZnO barrier and high electrical conductance. In contrast to the typical positive MR in MTJ by majority spin tunneling, negative MR is observed in FGT/ZnO/Ni MEJ. The minority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states near the E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, are dominantly emitted to FGT over the ZnO barrier, while majority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states below the E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, are blocked by it. In the FGT/FGT/ZnO/Ni heterostructure, the MR ratio is further increased by combining positive and negative MR at the MTJ (FGT/FGT) and MEJ (FGT/ZnO/Ni), respectively. As a result, FGT-MEJ exhibits 10&#8211;1000 orders higher conductance than other 2D-MTJs, while MR ratio remains similar to other 2D-MTJs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Managing Solvent Complexes to Amplify Ripening Process by Covalent Interaction Driving Force Under External Field for Perovskite Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal molecule is utilized to promote the movement of solvent complexes under external field, thus amplifying ripening process and optimizing the buried interface. Based on this, the efficiency of device reaches 25.24%, and it still maintains 75% of the original efficiency after 1400 h in a damp heat test.








Abstract
Up to now, post&#8208;annealing is most commonly used to post treat the perovskite film to accelerate the ripening process. Nonetheless, the top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism impedes the efficient desolvation of solvent complexes. Thus, residual solvent complexes tend to accumulate at the bottom of the film during the ripening process and deteriorate the device. Here, a new strategy with unique concept is promoted to amplify ripening process of perovskite film, in which a nematic thermotropic liquid crystal (LC) molecular is introduced to facilitate the conversion of solvent complexes by utilizing the liquid crystalline behavior under external field. Upon the concurrent application of thermal and force fields, the covalent interaction between LC and solvent complexes generates a driving force, which promotes upward migration of solvent complexes, thereby facilitating their engagement in the ripening process. In addition, the driving force under external fields assists the flattening of grain boundary grooves. Therefore, film quality is improved efficiently with amplified ripening process and adequately handled buried interface. Based on the positive effects, the devices achieve a champion efficiency of 25.24%, and sustained &#8776;75% of its initial efficiency level even after undergoing a damp heat test (85&#160;&#176;C/85% RH) for 1400 h.

         <title>Combined Photopolymerization and Localized Photochromism by Aza&#8208;Diarylethene and Hemiindigo Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four levels of advanced photoresponsive materials are reported using aza&#8208;diarylethene and hemiindigo photoswitches. Starting from blending photochromes with polymers, a novel photopolymerization by aza&#8208;diarylethene is demonstrated next, which can be combined with subsequent photochrome addition. Finally, synergistic and simultaneous photopolymerization and photochrome localization in a multi&#8208;photoresponsive materials application is realized.








Abstract
Molecular photoswitches produce light&#8208;controlled changes at the nanometer scale and can therefore be used to alter the states and behavior of materials in a truly bottom&#8208;up fashion. Here an escalating photonic complexity of material property control with light is shown using a recently developed aza&#8208;diarylethene in combination with hemiindigo (HI) photoswitches. First, aza&#8208;diarylethene can be used as a photoswitch in polystyrene (PS) to reversibly inscribe relief&#8208;type 3D structures into PS. Second, aza&#8208;diarylethene can further be used as a photoinitiator for light&#8208;induced polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA), demonstrating for the first time light&#8208;controlled chemical reactivity control with its zwitterionic switching state. Third, aza&#8208;diarylethene and HIs are implemented into aza&#8208;diarylethene polymerized MA, generating photochromic polymers. At the fourth level, a binary mixture allows to synergize aza&#8208;diarylethene&#8208;induced photopolymerization with localized photochromism changes of the simultaneously entrapped functional HI. With such multilevel light response, the utility of this particular photoswitch combination for applications in advanced photonic materials is demonstrated.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Pure&#8208;Green OLEDs with Gamut Approaching BT.2020 Standard: Deuteration Promotes Device Efficiency and Lifetime Simultaneously</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuteration strategy enables a versatile multi&#8208;resonance fluorescent emitter. The resulting OLED achieves pure&#8208;green emission approaching BT 2020 gamut, high device efficiency with EQEmax of 35.2% and PEmax of 187.0 lm&#160;W&#8722;1, and long lifetime (LT50 = 3020 h @ 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2).








Abstract
In order to fulfill the demand for ultrahigh definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), pure&#8208;green emitters with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) y&#8208;coordinate over 0.71 are in urgent demand. Meanwhile, the high device efficiency, small efficiency roll&#8208;off, and operational lifetime also remain challenging issues. In this work, a series of narrowband pure&#8208;green fluorescent emitters based on a double&#8208;boron (B) doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) framework fused with naphthalene units is reported. The newly designed emitters realize green emission with peaks of 512&#8211;521&#160;nm and extremely narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHMs) of 16&#8211;17&#160;nm in toluene solution. Utilizing these emitters in a phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (PSF) system, the resulting OLEDs exhibit pure green emission with peaks in the range of 514&#8211;526&#160;nm and very narrow FWHMs of 19&#8211;20&#160;nm. Notably, the devices based on the partially deuterated emitter, DBN&#8208;NaPh&#8208;d, not only achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) as high as 35.2%, small efficiency roll&#8208;off, along with a CIEy of 0.74 but also showcase impressive operational stability with a long lifetime (LT50) of over 3000&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work represents one of the highest device efficiencies and superior device stability among fluorescence emitter&#8208;based OLEDs.

         <title>Synergistic Cationic Shielding and Anionic Chemistry of Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate for Ultrastable Zn&#9472;I2 Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional additives of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) are rationally designed to achieve synergistic cationic shielding and anionic chemistry for ultrastable Zn||I2 full batteries. Electrostatic shielding K cations could construct the smooth deposition morphology effectively balancing the electric field distribution, while HP anions can reduce the activities of H2O and accelerate the charge transfer kinetics by the formation of SEI.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives are investigated to resolve dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and corrosion of Zn metal. In particular, the electrostatic shielding cationic strategy is considered an effective method to regulate deposition morphology. However, it is very difficult for such a simple cationic modification to avoid competitive hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and interfacial pH fluctuations. Herein, multifunctional additives of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) based on the synergistic design of cationic shielding and anionic chemistry for ultrastable Zn||I2 full batteries are demonstrated. K cations, acting as electrostatic shielding cations, constructed the smooth deposition morphology. HP anions can enter the first solvation shell of Zn2+ for the reduced activities of H2O, while they remain in the primary solvation shell and are finally involved in the formation of SEI, thus accelerating the charge transfer kinetics. Furthermore, by in situ monitoring the near&#8208;surface pH of the Zn electrode, the KHP additives can effectively inhibit the accumulation of OH&#8722; and the formation of by&#8208;products. Consequently, the symmetric cells achieve a high stripping&#8211;plating reversibility of over 4500 and 2600 h at 1.0 and 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The Zn||I2 full cells deliver an ultralong term stability of over 1400 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 78.5%.

         <title>Effective Dual Cation Release in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites for Ultrafast UV Light&#8208;Powered Imaging</title>

Dual cations released from the pre&#8208;deposited inorganic buffer layer effectively repair deep&#8208;level defects in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films by inducing low&#8208;dimensional phase reconstruction and undercoordinated ion interaction. With enhanced film quality and residual strain modulation, the fabricated photodetector exhibits a drastically improved self&#8208;powered photoresponse, demonstrating high compatibility with pixelated array design for ultrafast image sensing.








Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper quasi&#8208;2D perovskites represent robust candidates for optoelectronic applications, achieving a delicate balance between outstanding photoresponse and stability. However, mitigating the internal defects in polycrystalline films remains challenging, and their optoelectronic performances still lag behind that of their 3D counterparts. This work highlights the profound impact of defect passivation at the buried interface and grain boundaries through a dual&#8208;cation&#8208;release strategy. Cations released from the pre&#8208;deposited inorganic iodide buffer layer effectively repair deep&#8208;level defects by inducing low&#8208;dimensional phase reconstruction and interacting with undercoordinated ions. The resulting quasi&#8208;2D perovskite polycrystalline films feature large grain size (&gt;2 &#181;m) and minimum surface roughness, along with alleviated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane residual tensile strain, which is beneficial for inhibiting the initiation and propagation of cracks. The fabricated photodetector demonstrates drastically improved self&#8208;powered photoresponse capability, with maximum responsivity up to 0.41 A W&#8722;1 at 430&#160;nm and an ultrafast response speed of 161&#160;ns / 1.91 &#181;s. Moreover, this strategy is compatible with the photolithography&#8208;assisted hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic patterning process for fabricating pixelated photodetector arrays, which enables high&#8208;sensitivity imaging. This study presents a feasible defect passivation approach in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, thereby providing insights into the fabrication of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Giant Piezoelectric Coefficient of Polyvinylidene Fluoride with Rationally Engineered Ultrafine Domains Achieved by Rapid Freezing Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)&#8208;homopolymer with nanoscale TTTGTTTG&#8217;&#8208;conformational domain is fabricated by a simple modeling method of cyclic compression and rapid freezing. The domain engineered PVDF is able to provide ultrahigh d33 of 191.4 pC N&#8722;1. Meanwhile, only physical processing method is applied, indicating a method for preparing piezoelectric polymer with low cost, good mechanical properties, and ultra&#8208;high piezoelectric coefficient.








Abstract
Domains play an essential role in determining the piezoelectric properties of polymers. The conventional method for achieving ultrafine piezoelectric domain structures for polymers is multiphase polymerization, which is not the primary choice for industrial&#8208;scale applications because of its complex synthesis and weak mechanical properties. In this study, it is demonstrated for the first time that a nanoscale domain design can be achieved in a commercially available polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) homopolymer through a simple fabrication method involving cyclic compression and rapid freezing. The domain&#8208;engineered PVDF exhibits largely enhanced piezoelectric output with a record&#8208;breaking piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 191.4 picocoulombs per Newton (8.9 times higher than that of PVDF without engineered domain structure) and electromechanical coupling factor (k33) of 77.1%. Moreover, nanoscale domain&#8208;induced ferroelectric and dielectric evolutions are revealed. A smaller domain is found to be beneficial for domain switching. An in&#8208;depth understanding of the interplay between the domain structure and piezoelectric properties reveals a simple, low&#8208;cost method for fabricating high&#8208;performance polymeric piezoelectric.

         <title>Differentiated Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Boosting Multicolor Responsive MOF Heterostructures as Robust Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differentiated design on intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer is first reported to realize multicolor responsive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterostructures, which display the distinct responsive MOF regions under the same mild stimuli and generate multiple tunable color patterns, further functioning as robust photonic barcodes with high&#8208;security convert states. These results provide enlightenment on the development of a smart&#8208;responsive MOF heterosystem for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterostructures with hybrid architectures and abundant functional sites possess great potential applications in advanced information security, yet still suffer from the harsh stimuli mechanisms with restrained emission control. Herein, the differentiated design strategy on intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer is first reported to realize smart&#8208;responsive multicolor MOF heterostructures as robust anticounterfeiting labels. Designed similar MOF blocks with the differentiated intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer are integrated via time&#8208;dependent epitaxial growth to form multicolor MOF heterostructures. Different numbers of electron&#8208;donating groups in MOF blocks offer distinct space regulation on the torsion of charge transfer ligands, which trigger the diverse responsive emissions under the same mild stimuli, thus generating multiple tunable color patterns in heterostructures. These spatial&#8208;resolved MOF heterostructures with stable multicolor responsive modes permit the encoding of fingerprint information, which further functions as robust anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels with high&#8208;security convert states. These results offer a promising route for the function&#8208;oriented exploitation of smart&#8208;responsive MOF heterosystems for advanced information anticounterfeiting.

         <title>A Sucker&#8208;Reactor Polyoxometalate Assembled Superstructures for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) hybrid architecture is successfully constructed through simple self&#8208;assembly process, achieving high N2 fixation efficiency (98 &#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) at room temperature. IL and POM serve as the &#8220;sucker&#8221; and &#8220;reactor&#8221; for N2 capture and conversion into ammonia. The incorporation of ILs with variable alkyl chain lengths promotes N2 activation by manipulating electronic band structure.








Abstract
Designing a reaction system that integrates reactant capture and transformation in an artificial photosynthesis system to achieve high reaction efficiency remains challenging. Here, an ionic liquid (IL) &#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) superstructure photocatalyst (P2HPMo) is reported, where the anisotropy of the superstructure is allowed by adjusting the alkyl chain lengths of ILs. Experimental data and theoretical simulation show that ILs and POM serve as the &#8220;sucker&#8221; and &#8220;reactor&#8221; of the reaction system to capture and transform the reactants, respectively. In particular, the addition of quaternary phosphorous IL cations is not only conducive to the adsorption of N2 but also effectively promotes the activation of N2 by manipulating the energy band and electronic structure. Consequently, the synthesized P2HPMo exhibits an ammonia synthesis rate of 98 &#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values available in a sacrificial agent&#8208;free system.

Artificial Signaling Centers
In article number 2409731, Carsten Werner and co&#8208;workers develop a precision toolbox to modulate signaling gradients in tissue cultures. Spatial and temporal gradient control is achieved using sulfated glycosaminoglycan&#8208;based microgels (&#956;GUIDEs) with electrostatically tunable morphogen affinity for tailored release. Individual &#956;GUIDEs act as artificial signaling centers, locally directing vascular morphogenesis with high resolution.

Vessel Regeneration
Mesenchymal stem cells tethered to mechanically robust oxygen&#8208;generating injectable colloidal hydrogel significantly increased the secretion of various angiogenic cytokines and a chemokine that induced anti&#8208;inflammatory responses, reduced cellular apoptosis, and improved blood flow restoration and muscle regeneration in ischemic diseases. More details can be found in article number 2408488 by Mark W. Feinberg, Su Ryon Shin, and co&#8208;workers.

2D Supramolecular Nanomaterials for Virus Inhibition
In article number 2408294, Rainer Haag, Francesco Stellacci, Kai Ludwig, and their research team successfully inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) with an irreversible (virucidal) mechanism with self&#8208;assembled 2D supramolecular nanomaterials, based on a dendritic polymer. The cover image illustrates a &#8220;virus like&#8221; sea mine targeting a sailing ship (human lung). The forming 2D nanomaterials catch and trap it, like a fishing net and prevent it from reaching its target.

         <title>Fire&#8208;Safe Aerogels and Foams for Thermal Insulation: From Materials to Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerogels/foams are ideal thermally insulating materials owing to their low density and low thermal conductivity. To meet their practical applications, these aerogels/foams need to be thermally insulating, mechanically robust and fire&#8208;resistant. Recent advances on fire&#8208;safe thermal&#8208;insulating aerogels/foams are reviewed. Future research opportunities are proposed in response to key challenges for expediting the creation of next&#8208;generation aerogels/foams for better thermal management.








Abstract
The ambition of human beings to create a comfortable environment for work and life in a sustainable way has triggered a great need for advanced thermal insulation materials in past decades. Aerogels and foams present great prospects as thermal insulators owing to their low density, good thermal insulation, mechanical robustness, and even high fire resistance. These merits make them suitable for many real&#8208;world applications, such as energy&#8208;saving building materials, thermally protective materials in aircrafts and battery, and warming fabrics. Despite great advances, to date there remains a lack of a comprehensive yet critical review on the thermal insulation materials. Herein, recent progresses in fire&#8208;safe thermal&#8208;insulating aerogels and foams are summarized, and pros/cons of three major categories of aerogels/foams (inorganic, organic and their hybrids) are discussed. Finally, key challenges associated with existing aerogels are discussed and some future opportunities are proposed. This review is expected to expedite the development of advanced aerogels and foams as fire&#8208;safe thermally insulating materials, and to help create a sustainable, safe, and energy&#8208;efficient society.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Level High Entropy&#8208;Dissipative Structure Enables Efficient Self&#8208;Decoupling of Triple Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, new synthesis concept is the first time to fabricate high entropy&#8208;dissipative conductive layer of smart sensors within poly&#8208;pyrrole/zinc oxide system. The sensor achieves the triple self&#8208;decoupling effect of pressure and gas in the complex temperature&#8208;humidity field. Additionally, it inherits the strong robustness and endurance of traditional high&#8208;entropy materials for information transmission and smart alarm.








Abstract
The theory of high entropy&#8208;dissipative structure is confined to high&#8208;entropy alloys and their oxide materials under harsh conditions, but it is very difficult to obtain high entropy&#8208;dissipative structure for smart sensors based on polymers and metal oxides under mild conditions. Moreover, multiple signal coupling effect heavily hinder the sensor applications, and current multimodal integrated devices can solve two signal&#8208;decoupling, but need very complicated process way. In this work, new synthesis concept is the first time to fabricate high entropy&#8208;dissipative conductive layer of smart sensors with triple&#8208;signal response and self&#8208;decoupling ability within poly&#8208;pyrrole/zinc oxide (PPy/ZnO) system. The sensor (SPZ20) amplifies pressure (17.54%/kPa) and gas (0.37%/ppm), reduces humidity (0.41%/% RH) and temperature (0.12%/&#176;C) signals, simultaneously achieving the triple self&#8208;decoupling effect of pressure and gas in the complex temperature&#8208;humidity field because of the enlarged pressure&#8208;contact area, enhanced gas&#8208;responsive sites, altered vapor path and its own heat insulation function. Additionally, it inherits the strong robustness (500 rubbing, washing, and heating or freezing cycles) and endurance (10&#160;000 photo&#8208;purification cycles) of traditional high&#8208;entropy materials for information transmission and smart alarms in emergencies or harsh environments. This work gives a new insight into the multiple&#8208;signal response and smart flexible electronic design from natural fibers.

         <title>Integrating Interactive Ir Atoms into Titanium Oxide Lattice for Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactive Ir atoms with varied geometric structure play a crucial role in promoting the intrinsic oxygen&#8208;evolution activity, as it can optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the d&#8208;band center of active Ir sites. This correlation of Ir atoms benefits their valence stability, suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of active Ir and synergistically improving the catalyst durability.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir)&#8208;based oxide is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalyst for acidic water oxidation, yet it is restricted to a few Ir&#8208;O octahedral packing modes with limited structural flexibility. Herein, the geometric structure diversification of Ir is achieved by integrating spatially correlated Ir atoms into the surface lattice of TiO2 and its booting effect on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is investigated. Notably, the resultant i&#8208;Ir/TiO2 catalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity, with an overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability of 315 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. Both experimental and theoretical findings reveal that flexible Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir coordination with varied geometric structure plays a crucial role in enhancing OER activity, which optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the d&#8208;band center of active Ir sites. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the interactive Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir units can suppress over&#8208;oxidation of Ir, effectively widening the stable region of Ir species during the catalytic process. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, equipped with i&#8208;Ir/TiO2 as an anode, gives a low driving voltage of 1.63 V at 2 A cm&#8722;2 and maintains stable performance for over 440 h. This work presents a general strategy to eliminate the inherent geometric limitations of IrOx species, thereby inspiring further development of advanced catalyst designs.

Both experimental and theoretical findings reveal that flexible Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir coordination with varied geometric structure plays a crucial role in enhancing OER activity, which optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of active Ir sites. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the interactive Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir units can suppress over-oxidation of Ir, effectively widening the stable region of Ir species during the catalytic process. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, equipped with &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ir/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an anode, gives a low driving voltage of 1.63 V at 2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains stable performance for over 440 h. This work presents a general strategy to eliminate the inherent geometric limitations of IrO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; species, thereby inspiring further development of advanced catalyst designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust and Versatile Biodegradable Unclonable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels with Multi&#8208;Mode Optical Encoding Using Protein&#8208;Mediated Luminescent Calcite Signatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable, robust, and versatile PUF platform with multi&#8208;mode encoding, multi&#8208;level cryptographic keys, and multiple authentication operations is developed by imprinting chaotically grown calcites on a versatile protein film. This all&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based PUF exhibits superior encoding diversity, eco&#8208;friendly manufacturing, authentication ease, stability, and versatility over existing biocompatible PUF labels, providing a practical, high&#8208;security solution for combating counterfeiting across various applications.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are emerging as a cutting&#8208;edge technology for enhancing information security by providing robust security authentication and non&#8208;reproducible cryptographic keys. Incorporating renewable and biocompatible materials into PUFs ensures safety for handling, compatibility with biological systems, and reduced environmental impact. However, existing PUF platforms struggle to balance high encoding capacity, diversified encryption signatures, and versatile functionalities with sustainability and biocompatibility. Here, all&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based unclonable anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels featuring multi&#8208;mode encoding, multi&#8208;level cryptographic keys, and multiple authentication operations are developed by imprinting biomimetic&#8208;grown calcites on versatile silk protein films. In this label, the inherent non&#8208;clonability comes from the randomized characteristics of calcites, mediated by silk protein during crystal growth. The successful embedding of photoluminescent molecules into calcite lattices, assisted by silk protein, allows the resulting platform to utilize fluorescence patterns alongside birefringence for high&#8208;capacity encoding. This design facilitates easy and rapid authentication through Hamming distance and convolutional neural networks using standard cameras and portable microscopes. Moreover, angle&#8208;dependent polarization patterns enable multi&#8208;level key generation, while multi&#8208;spectral fluorescence signals offer multi&#8208;channel keys. The developed anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels combine biodegradability, green manufacture, easy authentication, high&#8208;level complexity, low cost, robustness, patternability, and versatility, offering a practical and high&#8208;security solution to combat counterfeiting across various applications.

         <title>Ultrafast H&#8208;Spillover in Intermetallic PtZn Induced by the Local Disorder for Excellent Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered intermetallic Platinum&#8208;Zinc (PtZn) nanoparticles with the local disorder confined in NPC (I&#8208;PtZn@NPC) are realized by a confinement&#8208;high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis strategy. The simultaneous exposure of Pt and Zinc (Zn) atoms enables I&#8208;PtZn@NPC with excellent HER performance in acid through an ultra&#8208;short spillover channel (Pt site &#8594; Pt&#8208;Zn bridge site&#8594; Zn site).








Abstract
Ordered intermetallic Platinum&#8208;Zinc (PtZn) shows potential in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but faces a huge challenge in activity enhancement due to the H&#8208;repulsion properties of Zinc (Zn). Here, local disorder in ordered intermetallic PtZn nanoparticles confined in N&#8208;doped porous carbon (I&#8208;PtZn@NPC) via a confinement&#8208;high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis strategy is realized to boost the HER performance. Experiments and calculations demonstrate that the local substitution of Pt atoms for Zn atoms creates an ultra&#8208;short H&#8208;spillover channel (Pt site&#8594;Pt&#8208;Zn bridge site &#8594;Zn site). Benefiting from such an ultra&#8208;fast H&#8208;migration from Pt site to Zn site, I&#8208;PtZn@NPC exhibits enhanced intrinsic activity with an ultralow overpotential (&#951;10: 2.3&#160;mV, &#951;100: 24&#160;mV) than commercial Pt black catalyst. Furthermore, a 25 cm2 commercial proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer equipped with I&#8208;PtZn@NPC achieved stable operation at 1.60 Vcell for 200&#160;h at a current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8315;2. This design of local Zn disorder in the ordered intermetallic PtZn sheds new light on the rational development of efficient Zn&#8208;based alloy HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Giant Topological Hall Effect and Colossal Magnetoresistance in Heusler Ferromagnet near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferromagnetic shape memory Heusler alloy Ni2Mn1.4In0.6 exhibits colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and giant topological Hall effect (THE) near room temperature, which is attributed to the enhanced spin chirality emerging from the formation of domains and domain walls, which in turn resulted from the combined effect of magnetic field induced martensite twin variant reorientation and magnetic field induced structural phase transformation.








Abstract
Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is an exotic phenomenon that allows for the efficient magnetic control of electrical resistivity and has attracted significant attention in condensed matter due to its potential for memory and spintronic applications. Heusler alloys are the subject of considerable interest in this context due to the electronic properties that result from the nontrivial band topology. Here, the observation of CMR near room temperature is reported in the shape memory Heusler alloy Ni2Mn1.4In0.6, which is attributed to the combined effects of magnetic field&#8208;induced martensite twin variant reorientation (MFIR) and magnetic field&#8208;induced structural phase transformation (MFIPT). This compound undergoes a structural phase transition from a cubic (austenite&#8208;L21) ferromagnetic (FM) to a monoclinic (martensite) antiferromagnetic (AFM), which leads to an effective increase in the size of the Fermi surface and consequently in CMR. Additionally, it exhibits significant anomalous Hall conductivity in both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. Furthermore, it demonstrates a giant topological Hall resistivity (THR) &#961;yxT$\rho _{{\mathrm{yx}}}^{\mathrm{T}}$ &#8776;6&#160;&#181;&#937;.cm in the vicinity of martensite transition due to the enhanced spin chirality resulting from the formation of magnetic domains with Bloch&#8208;type domain walls. The findings contribute to the understanding of the magnetotransport of Ni&#8208;Mn&#8208;In Heusler alloys, which are prospective candidates for room&#8208;temperature spintronic applications.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Hydrogel Featuring Antibacterial and Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Properties for Treating Periodontitis in Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immunomodulatory hydrogel is developed to treat periodontitis in diabetes. This formulation combines chlorhexidine acetate, epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate, gelatin methacryloyl, and oxidized hyaluronic acid, endowing the hydrogel with strong antibacterial capabilities and effective reactive oxygen species scavenging properties.








Abstract
Periodontal disease is a multifactorial, bacterially induced inflammatory disorder characterized by progressive destruction of periodontal tissues. Additionally, diabetes mellitus exacerbates periodontitis, resulting in expedited resorption of periodontal bone. However, methods such as mechanical debridement, anti&#8208;inflammatory medications, and surgical approaches often fail to eradicate local infections and inflammation, complicating the reconstruction of periodontal tissue structures. Consequently, there is an urgent need to devise a novel strategy for managing diabetic periodontal conditions. Here, a multifunctional controlled&#8208;release drug delivery system (GOE1) is developed by encapsulating self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles (consisting of chlorhexidine acetate and epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate) into a hydrogel matrix composed of gelatin methacryloyl and oxidized hyaluronic acid. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the GOE1 hydrogel possesses good antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, and transgenic sequence genomics further illustrates that IL&#8208;17&#8208;producing RAW 264.7 macrophages are critical for mediating M1/M2 macrophage transition and provide favorable immune microenvironment. In addition, in vivo experiments reveal that GOE1 significantly ameliorates periodontal tissue inflammation and reduces the loss of alveolar bone by reducing inflammatory infiltration and collagen destruction. Overall, the GOE1 hydrogel offers a promising therapeutic option for managing diabetic periodontitis.

In vitro experiments demonstrate that the GOE1 hydrogel possesses good antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and transgenic sequence genomics further illustrates that IL-17-producing RAW 264.7 macrophages are critical for mediating M1/M2 macrophage transition and provide favorable immune microenvironment. In addition, in vivo experiments reveal that GOE1 significantly ameliorates periodontal tissue inflammation and reduces the loss of alveolar bone by reducing inflammatory infiltration and collagen destruction. Overall, the GOE1 hydrogel offers a promising therapeutic option for managing diabetic periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Capacitive Energy Storage Enabled by Molecularly Interpenetrating Interfaces in Layered Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer dielectrics are ubiquitous in electronics and electrical power systems, but suffer from low energy density (Ue) and charge&#8211;dischage efficiency (&#951;). Here a scalable approach utilizing the designed molecularly interpenetrating interfaces is presented to achieve all&#8208;organic dielectric polymers with an ultahigh Ue of 22.89&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at &#951; &#8805; 90%, far outperforming exisitng polymer dielectrics.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are essential for advanced electronics and electrical power systems, yet they suffer from low energy density (Ue) due to their low dielectric constant (K) and the inverse relationship between K and breakdown stength (Eb). Here a scalable approach utilizing the designed molecularly interpenetrating interfaces is presented to achieve all&#8208;organic dielectric polymers with high Ue and charge&#8211;dischage efficiency (&#951;). Distinctive intermolecular interactions and microstructural changes, as demonstrated experimentally and theoretically, are introduced by the molecularly interpenetrating interfaces, resulting in simultaneous improvements in dielectric responses and mechanical strength while inhibiting electrical conduction &#8211; outcomes unattainable in conventional layered polymers. Consequently, exceptional improvments in both K and Eb are achieved, yielding a very high Ue of 22.89&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with &#951; &#8805; 90%, outperforming current layered polymer dielectrics. The bilayers can be easily fabricated into large&#8208;area films with high uniformity and outstanding capacitive stability (&gt;500&#8201;000 cycles), offering a practical route to scalable high&#8208;Ue polymer dielectrics for electrical energy storage.

         <title>Root&#8208;Growth&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Morphology&#8208;Evolution of Microsized Bismuth Surrounded by Microsized Hard Carbon for Stabilized Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

Inspired by &#8220;root growth in soil&#8221;, microsized Bi particles (&#181;m&#8208;Bi, as &#8220;seeds&#8221;) surrounded by microsized hard carbon particles (&#181;m&#8208;HC) matrix (as &#8220;soil&#8221;) are ingeniously dispersed through a simple mixing approach. This design utilizes the morphological self&#8208;evolution of &#181;m&#8208;Bi into Bi&#8208;nanonetworks between dispersed &#181;m&#8208;HC, leading to 2000 stable cycles.








Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type materials are desirable for high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Different from nanoengineering with pre&#8208;reserving void space and confined carbon coatings, microsized particles promise high specific/volumetric capacities, easy manufacturing, and low cost but are prone to rapid capacity loss. Herein, inspired by the process of &#8220;root growth in soil&#8221;, microsized Bi particles (&#181;m&#8208;Bi, as &#8220;seeds&#8221;) surrounded by microsized hard carbon particles (&#181;m&#8208;HC, as &#8220;soil&#8221;) are ingeniously dispersed through a simple mixing approach. This design utilizes the morphological self&#8208;evolution of &#181;m&#8208;Bi into Bi&#8208;nanonetworks between dispersed &#181;m&#8208;HC during repeated (de)sodiations, leading to a stable capacity retention of 99.8% for 2000 cycles, higher than that of the &#181;m&#8208;Bi electrode (7.2%) at a high mass loading of 5.5 mg cm&#8722;2. The interconnected Bi&#8208;nanonetworks and &#181;m&#8208;HC particles provide continuous electron pathways and facilitate electrolyte infiltration, which effectively boosts electrical contact, stable cycling, and high&#8208;rate capability. Especially, the hybrid Bi40HC60 (optimized weight ratio) thick&#8208;film electrode shows boosted comprehensive electrochemical performance, superior to HC and &#181;m&#8208;Bi electrodes. The Bi40HC60||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell, assembled without any pre&#8208;treatment, delivers 4500 stable cycles. This nature&#8208;inspired strategy provides a simple yet practical approach for employing the electrochemically driven evolution of micro&#8208;sized active materials and realizing high specific/volumetric capacities, fast kinetics, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Assisted Passivation Growth of 2D Ultrathin &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 Crystals for High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface&#8208;assisted passivation growth strategy is designed to synthesize ultrathin and large size &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 crystals with the thickness down to 0.77 nm and the lateral size up to 163 &#181;m. Experiments and theoretical calculations substantiate the growth mechanism. Remarkably, &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 flakes based photodetectors exhibit excellent performance and anisotropic photodetection that surpass or are comparable to other 2D materials devices.








Abstract
2D nonlayered materials (NLMs) have garnered considerable attention due to unique surface structure and bright application prospect. However, owing to the strong interatomic forces caused by intrinsic isotropic chemical bonds in all directions, the direct synthesis of ultrathin and large area 2D NLMs remains a tremendous challenge. Here, the surface&#8208;assisted passivation growth strategy is designed to synthesize ultrathin and large size &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 crystals with the thickness down to 0.77 nm and the lateral size up to 163 &#181;m. These results are primarily ascribed to the bonding between Se atoms and the unsaturated Bi atoms on the surface of &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3, resulting in the surface passivation and promoting the obtaining of ultrathin &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3. Strikingly, the photodetectors based on &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 flakes exhibit a high photoresponsivity of 71.91 A W&#8722;1, an excellent detectivity of 6.09 &#215; 1013 Jones, a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 2.4 &#215; 104%, an outstanding anisotropic photodetection and excellent UV imaging capability at 365 nm. This work sheds light on the synthesis of 2D ultrathin NLMs and promotes their applications in multifunctional optoelectronics.

         <title>Plasmonic Single&#8208;Molecule Affinity Detection at 10&#8722;20 Molar</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;resonance (SPR) typically detects in the nanomolar range. A pH&#8208;conditioning of a physisorbed biolayer, hosting trillions of capturing antibodies or probes enables SPR to detect a single protein or DNA&#8208;strand in 0.1 mL of plasma. The pH&#8208;conditioning transition the biolayer in a metastable state where a single affinity&#8208;biding event can trigger an amplification mechanism involving a broad self&#8208;propagating electrostatic rearrangement








Abstract
DNA can be readily amplified through replication, enabling the detection of a single&#8208;target copy. A comparable performance for proteins in immunoassays has yet to be fully assessed. Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;resonance (SPR) serves as a probe capable of performing assays at concentrations typically around 10&#8315;&#8313; molar. In this study, plasmonic single&#8208;molecule assays for both proteins and DNA are demonstrated, achieving limits&#8208;of&#8208;detections (LODs) as low as 10&#8315;2&#8304; molar (1&#160;&#177;&#160;1 molecule in 0.1&#160;mL), even in human serum, in 1 h. This represents an improvement in typical SPR LODs by eleven orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude. The single&#8208;molecule SPR assay is achieved with a millimeter&#8208;wide surface functionalized with a physisorbed biolayer comprising trillions of recognition&#8208;elements (antibodies or protein&#8211;probe complexes) which undergo an acidic or alkaline pH&#8208;conditioning. Potentiometric and surface&#8208;probing imaging experiments reveal the phenomenon underlying this extraordinary performance enhancement. The data suggest an unexplored amplification process within the biomaterial, where pH&#8208;conditioning, driving the biolayer in a metastable state, induces a self&#8208;propagating aggregation of partially misfolded proteins, following single&#8208;affinity binding. This process triggers an electrostatic rearrangement, resulting in the displacement of a charge equivalent to 1.5e per 102 recognition elements. Such findings open new opportunities for reliable SPR&#8208;based biosensing at the physical detection limits, with promising applications in point&#8208;of&#8208;care plasmonic systems.

         <title>Fabricating Lattice&#8208;Confined Pt Single Atoms With High Electron&#8208;Deficient State for Alkali Hydrogen Evolution Under Industrial&#8208;Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;confined Pt1/Ni(OH)2 SACs with excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are constructed by a co&#8208;reduction strategy. Mechanism studies disclose the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during HER. Finally, this facile synthesis approach is extended to fabricate other 9 lattice&#8208;confined SACs.








Abstract
The confining effect is essential to regulate the activity and stability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), but the universal fabrication of confined SACs is still a great challenge. Here, various lattice&#8208;confined Pt SACs supported by different carriers are constructed by a universal co&#8208;reduction approach. Notably, Pt single atoms confined in the lattice of Ni(OH)2 (Pt1/Ni(OH)2) with a high electron&#8208;deficient state exhibit excellent activity for basic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 just requires 15&#160;mV to get 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and the mass activity of Pt1/Ni(OH)2 is 15 times of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 assembled in an alkaline water electrolyzer shows 1030&#160;h durability under the industrial current density of 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy techniques reveal Pt&#9472;H and &#8220;free&#8221; OH radical can be directly observed for Pt1/Ni(OH)2, confirming the lattice&#8208;confined Pt single atoms play a key role during HER. Further density functional theory uncovers the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, which quickly optimizes the electronic state of the Pt site, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step to 0.16&#160;eV for HER. Finally, this synthesis method is extended to construct other 9 lattice&#8208;confined SACs.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Isolated in Mesoporous Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOFs which are exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
As an alternative to bulk counterparts, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles isolated within conductive mesoporous carbon matrices are of increasing interest for electrochemical applications. Although promising, a &#8220;clean&#8221; carbon surface is generally associated with poor compatibility and weak interactions with metal/ligand precursors, which leads to the growth of MOFs with inhomogeneous particle sizes on outer pore walls. Here, a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOF composites within mesochannels with high dispersity and stability are reported. Mesoporous polydopamine (mesoPDA)&#8208;F127 nanospheres with unique surface chemistry, e.g., nanoconfined spaces, catechol functional groups, pyrrolic N doping, and hydrophilic PEO blocks, are found to be a suitable molecular platform. Sliced cross&#8208;sectional TEM, HAADF&#8208;STEM, and corresponding EDS elemental mapping, as well as nitrogen adsorption characterizations, are utilized to visualize the in situ growth process of ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles. These careful analyses provides direct evidence that the highly dispersed ZIF&#8208;8 is exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. After moderate carbonization of the mesoPDA&#8208;F127/ZIF&#8208;8 nanocomposites, a prototype for a mesoporous carbon&#8208;isolated ZIF&#8208;8 nanostructure is achieved, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons.

         <title>Maximizing Output Energy via Suppressing Charge Loss and Increasing Load Voltage in Charge Extraction Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new charge loss and a voltage loss model are proposed and a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&#8722;2 is achieved by the effective collection of interface tribo&#8208;charges and the increase in load voltage during the charge extraction process.








Abstract
The effective collection of interfacial tribo&#8208;charges and an increase in load voltage are two essential factors that improve the output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators. However, some tribo&#8208;charges are hardly collected through one or multiple integrated side electrodes based on corona discharge, and their load voltages are limited by air breakdown in adjacent electrodes. In this study, a dynamic quasi&#8208;dipole potential distribution model is proposed to systematically reveal the mechanisms of interfacial tribo&#8208;charge loss. Based on this model, an optimization route is designed to reduce the interfacial charge loss stepwise, achieving a 15&#8208;fold improvement in charge collection from the tribo&#8208;interface.&#160;A potential difference enhancement strategy is used for the first time to increase the air breakdown threshold between the inner electrodes and increase the output voltage under a large load. By effective increase in charge collection efficiency and load voltage, a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&#8722;2 is obtained. This study refined and optimized the interfacial charge loss mechanisms and provided advanced guidance for efficiently extracting energy during the triboelectrification process.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Polymer Composite Dielectrics: Energy Storage Performance, Large&#8208;Scale Preparation, and Device Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review meticulously outlines the main effects of elevated temperatures on performance for polymer dielectrics and summarizes core modification strategies, while discussing the reasons for the performance difference between lab research and practical application from large&#8208;scale preparation and device design. This review may serve as a roadmap for the research and development of polymer dielectrics for years to come.








Abstract
Film capacitors are widely used in advanced electrical and electronic systems. The temperature stability of polymer dielectrics plays a critical role in supporting their performance operation at elevated temperatures. For the last decade, the investigations for new polymer dielectrics with high energy storage performance at higher temperatures (&gt;200 &#176;C) have attracted much attention and numerous strategies have been employed. However, there is currently still a large gap between lab research and large&#8208;scale production. In this review, the main effects of high temperature on the dielectric properties are analyzed and core modification strategies are summarized. The scientific and technological reasons for the performance difference between lab research and practical application are also discussed. Further, several processes for large&#8208;scale film preparation and typical device structure design are reviewed. The current research and product launches pertaining of high&#8208;temperature film capacitors are also summarized. Conclusive insights and future perspectives are delineated to offer strategic direction for the ongoing and prospective innovation in polymer dielectric materials.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Biomass Oxidation via Acid&#8208;Induced In Situ Surface Reconstruction of Multivalent State Coexistence in Metal Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical processes. This study introduces a novel acid&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction strategy on metal foams, enabling efficient biomass transformation. The approach is versatile, adaptable across metals and acids, and provides a scalable platform for green chemistry, demonstrating significant potential for advancing resource recycling and sustainable industrial applications.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic biomass conversion offers a sustainable route for producing organic chemicals, with electrode design being critical to determining reaction rate and selectivity. Herein, a prediction&#8208;synthesis&#8208;validation approach is developed to obtain electrodes for precise biomass conversion, where the coexistence of multiple metal valence states leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the activated redox cycle. This promising integrated foam electrode is developed via acid&#8208;induced surface reconstruction to in situ generate highly active metal (oxy)hydroxide or oxide (MOxHy or MOx) species&#160;on inert foam electrodes, facilitating the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Taking nickel foam electrode as an example, the resulting NiOxHy/Ni catalyst, featuring the coexistence of multivalent states of Ni, exhibits remarkable activity and stability with a FDCA yields over 95% and a Faradaic efficiency of 99%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical analysis reveal an Ni(OH)2/NiOOH&#8208;mediated indirect pathway, with the chemical oxidation of 5&#8208;HMF as the rate&#8208;limiting step. Furthermore, this in situ surface reconstruction approach can be extended to various metal foams (Fe, Cu, FeNi, and NiMo), offering a mild, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for preparing potent foam catalysts. This approach promotes a circular economy by enabling more efficient biomass conversion processes, providing a versatile and impactful tool in the field of sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Spin State Modulation with Oxygen Vacancy Orientates C/N Intermediates for Urea Electrosynthesis of Ultrahigh Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored transformation of high&#8208;spin Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) into low&#8208;spin Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) by introducing oxygen vacancies (Ov) can enhance reduction/adsorption of NO3&#8210;&#8594;*NO and subsequent protonation to generate *NH2 intermediate, which in situ acts as a localized proton donor to promote *CO2&#8594;*COOH on adjacent Ce3+&#8211;O site for generating *CO intermediate, following by cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced C&#8208;/N&#8208;intermediates to achieve efficient urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to synthesize urea has become an effective pathway to alternate the conventional Bosch&#8208;Meiser process, while the complexity of C&#8208;/N&#8208;containing intermediates for C&#8722;N coupling results in the urea electrosynthesis of unsatisfactory efficiency. In this work, an electronic spin state modulation maneuver with oxygen vacancies (Ov) is unveiled to effectively meliorate the oriented generation of key intermediates *NH2 and *CO for C&#8722;N coupling, furnishing urea in ultrahigh yield of 2175.47&#160;&#181;g mg&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and Faraday efficiency of 70.1%. Mechanistic studies expound that Ov can induce the conversion of the high&#8208;spin state Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) of Ni@CeO2&#8722;x to the low&#8208;spin state Ni3+ (t2g6eg1), which markedly enhances the hybridization degree of the Ni 3d and the N 2p orbitals of *NO, facilitating the selective formation of *NH2. Notably, the in situ generated *NH2 intermediates can serve as a localized proton donor to promote the electroreduction of CO2 on the adjacent site Ce3+&#8722;O to exclusively afford *CO, followed by C&#8722;N coupling of each other to efficiently synthesize urea. The strategy of tailored switching of the active site spin state provides a reliable reference to rectify the electronic structure of electrocatalysts for directional CO2 valorization.

         <title>In Situ, Treatment with Guanidinium Chloride Ligand Enables Efficient Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 23.5% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insufficient hole injection, excessive electron injection, and abundant defects on the surface of QDs are limiting the performance of blue QLEDs. An in situ patching strategy with GACl is proposed to simultaneously passivate surface defects and enhance hole injection, with the EQE increasing from 16.3% to 23.5%. The model is proposed to understand the physical mechanism of hole injection and transport.








Abstract
The poor efficiency and stability of blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting diodes (QLED) hinders the practical applications of QLEDs full&#8208;color displays. Excessive electron injection, insufficient hole injection, and abundant defects on the surface of quantum dots (QD) are the main issues limiting the performance of blue devices. Herein, an in situ treatment with bipolar small molecule polydentate ligand&#8211;guanidine chloride (GACl) is proposed to simultaneously suppress excessive electron injection, patch surface defects of QDs and enhance hole injection. GACl&#8208;treated blue QLEDs exhibited a remarkable increase in maximal external quantum Efficiency (EQE) from 16.3% to a record 23.5%, accompanied by maximal luminance (36810&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent maximal current efficiency (17.5&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1), and enhanced device stability. Combining C&#8211;V and J&#8211;V characteristics, a concise physical model of hole injection is also established: Below 3&#160;V, hole injection is controlled by the interfacial barrier, primarily through tunneling and thermionic injection; Above 3&#160;V, the interfacial barrier is eliminated, and hole injection efficiency is governed by transport within the QD layer. This study showed a clear physical model for understanding the hole injection mechanism in QLEDs, offering valuable design strategies for improving the performance of blue&#8208;QLEDs.

         <title>Directional Freeze&#8208;Casting Cryogel Loaded with Quaternized Chitosan Modified Gallium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Capture and Eradicate the Resistant Bacteria for Guided Regeneration in Infected Bone Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. This work reported a quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GaMOF), to capture the Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221; and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me). Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel (Me/QCSGa&#8208;MOF@Cryogel) is fabricated for combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. Its recurrent and resistant nature, high incidence rate, long&#8208;term hospitalization, and high medical costs have driven the efforts of the scientific community to develop new therapies to improve the situation. Considering the complex microenvironment and persistent mechanisms mediated by resistant bacteria, it is crucial to develop an implant with enhanced osseointegration and sustained and effective infection clearance effects. Here, a positively charged quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (GaMOF) is designed, to capture the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria (Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221;, and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me) via disturbing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel loaded with the Me and QCSGaMOF is fabricated by the directional freeze&#8208;casting method. The oriented porous structure has an enhanced osseointegration effect by guiding the ingrowth of osteogenic cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments prove the advantages of as&#8208;prepared Me/QCSGa&#8208;MOF@Cryogel in combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.

         <title>Buffer&#8208;Less Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a systematic method for the direct growth of GaN on six&#8208;inch silicon substrates without buffers, significantly reducing GaN&#8208;to&#8208;substrate thermal resistance while maintaining structural quality comparable to buffered approaches. As&#8208;grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this buffer&#8208;less platform demonstrate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D electron gas mobilities, paving the way for efficient III&#8208;nitride transistors and advancing fundamental research on electron dynamics.








Abstract
Thick metamorphic buffers are considered indispensable for III&#8208;V semiconductor heteroepitaxy on large lattice and thermal&#8208;expansion mismatched silicon substrates. However, III&#8208;nitride buffers in conventional GaN&#8208;on&#8208;Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) impose a substantial thermal resistance, deteriorating device efficiency and lifetime by throttling heat extraction. To circumvent this, a systematic methodology for the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on six&#8208;inch silicon substrates is demonstrated using metal&#8208;organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Crucial growth&#8208;stress modulation to prevent epilayer cracking is achieved even without buffers, and threading dislocation densities comparable to those in buffered structures are realized. The buffer&#8208;less design yields a GaN&#8208;to&#8208;substrate thermal resistance of (11 &#177; 4) m2&#160;K&#160;GW&#8722;1, an order of magnitude reduction over conventional GaN&#8208;on&#8208;Si and one of the lowest on any non&#8208;native substrate. As&#8208;grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this template show a high&#8208;quality 2D electron gas (2DEG) whose room&#8208;temperature Hall&#8208;effect mobility exceeds 2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, rivaling the best&#8208;reported values. As further validation, the low&#8208;temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov&#8208;de&#8208;Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime &gt; 0.180 ps, and tell&#8208;tale signatures of spin&#8208;splitting. These results could establish a new platform for III&#8208;nitrides, potentially enhancing the energy efficiency of power transistors and enabling fundamental investigations into electron dynamics in quasi&#8208;2D wide&#8208;bandgap systems.

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Universal Surface Residual Alkali Conversion Chemistry for Rechargeable Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal surface residual alkali conversion strategy based on NH4F treatment and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. The approach transforms residual alkali into a stable polymer coating which can enhance interfacial stability, suppress lattice oxygen release and reduce side reactions, providing a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for layered oxide cathodes in practical application.








Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are attractive cathode candidates for rechargeable secondary batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, LTMOs suffer from severe capacity attenuation, voltage decay, and sluggish kinetics, resulting from irreversible lattice oxygen evolution and unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Besides, LTMOs accumulate surface residual alkali species, like hydroxides and carbonates, during synthesis, limiting their practical application. Herein, a universal strategy is suggested to in situ convert surface residual alkali into a stable polymer coating layer for LTMOs, thus turning wastes into treasure. The formation process of polymer coating involves NH4F treatment to consume residual alkali, then utilizing generated fluorides to induce the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Implementing this strategy to Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LRM) results in a notable reduction in voltage hysteresis, along with enhanced kinetics and cycling stability in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. With this layer of encapsulation, surface lattice oxygen release and layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition of LRM are significantly alleviated with minimal mechanical degradation and surface parasitic reactions. Such strategy can also be applied to air&#8208;sensitive sodium&#8208;rich LTMOs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries,&#160;which showcases superior universality. This work might provide a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for LTMOs in practical application.

         <title>Bifunctional Group Modulation Strategy Enables MR&#8208;TADF Electroluminescence Toward BT.2020 Green Light Standard</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;bifunctional group modulation strategy&#8221; enables precise emission wavelength control while maintaining exceptionally narrow FWHM values. Non&#8208;sensitized pure green OLEDs based on DBNDS&#8208;TPh exhibited peak EQE of 34.5% and 36.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.76) and (0.19, 0.75) at the doping concentration of 1 and 3 wt.%. This is the first instance of a green OLED in a bottom&#8208;emitting device structure achieving a CIEy value of 0.76.








Abstract
Herein, a parallel &#8220;bifunctional group&#8221; modulation method is proposed to achieve controlled modulation of the emission wavelength and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. As a result, three proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, namely DBNDS&#8208;TPh, DBNDS&#8208;DFPh, and DBNDS&#8208;CNPh, are designed and synthesized, with the first functional dibenzo[b,d]thiophene unit concurrently reducing the bandgap and elevate their triplet state energy. A second functional group 1,1&#8242;:3&#8242;,1&#8243;&#8208;triphenyl, and electron acceptors 1,3&#8208;difluorobenzene and benzonitrile, respectively, to deepen the HOMO and LUMO levels. Accordingly, the CIE coordinates of DBNDS&#8208;TPh, DBNDS&#8208;DFPh, and DBNDS&#8208;CNPh are (0.13, 0.77), (0.14, 0.77), and (0.14, 0.76) respectively, in a dilute toluene solution. This marks the first instance of achieving a CIEy value of 0.77 in dilute toluene solutions. Significantly, the non&#8208;sensitized pure&#8208;green OLEDs based on DBNDS&#8208;TPh and DBNDS&#8208;DFPh demonstrate peak EQE of 35.0% and 34.5%, with corresponding CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.75), (0.17, 0.76) at the doping concentration of 1 wt.%, representing the first green OLED with a CIEy value reaching 0.76 in a bottom&#8208;emitting device structure as reported in the literature.

         <title>High&#8208;Modulus Homochiral Torsional Oxide Ceramic Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;modulus homochiral Al2O3 yarn artificial muscles with a different actuation mechanism containing volume expansion and topological structure transformation are fabricated. Under an electric drive, the torsional muscle provides a high actuation stress of 483.5 MPa, a large energy density of 9.8 J&#160;g&#8722;1, and a high output power of 10.3 W&#160;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a large stroke of 13.5%.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;based artificial muscles are soft actuators used to mimic the movement of human muscles. However, using high modulus oxide ceramics to fabricate artificial muscles with high energy and power is a challenge as they are prone to brittle fracture during torsion. Here, a ceramic metallization strategy is reported that solves the problem of low torsion and low ductility of alumina (Al2O3) ceramics by chemical plating a thin copper layer on alumina filaments. These filaments with a high modulus of &#8776;180&#160;GPa can be twisted into chiral coiled artificial muscles, exhibiting a unique electric thermal actuation mechanism. This tough and robust alumina artificial muscle can carry objects equivalent to 0.28 million times its weight and provide high actuation stress of up to 483.5&#160;MPa. In addition, it exhibits 18 times higher contraction power and 240 times higher energy density than human muscles, as well as a high energy conversion efficiency of up to 7.59%, which far exceeds most reported actuated carbon and polymer artificial muscles. This work has achieved large&#8208;scale manufacturing of high&#8208;modulus oxide ceramic muscles for the first time.

         <title>Interfacial Atomic Mechanisms of Single&#8208;Crystalline MoS2 Epitaxy on Sapphire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study conclusively resolves the atomic configuration at the growth interface, unveiling a periodic molecular MoO3 layer van der Waals epitaxially grown on a single Al&#8208;terminated sapphire (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3)&#160;surface. This structure, distinct from prior reports, aligns perfectly with experimental data and enhances the interaction between molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and &#945;&#8208;Al2O3. By introducing unique 1&#8208;fold symmetry, it enables unidirectional MoS2 alignment, offering fresh insights into interfacial atomic engineering.








Abstract
The epitaxial growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS&#8322;)&#160;on sapphire&#160;substrates enables the formation of single&#8208;crystalline monolayer MoS&#8322; with exceptional material properties on a wafer scale. Despite this achievement, the underlying growth mechanisms remain a subject of debate. The epitaxial interface is critical for understanding these mechanisms, yet its exact atomic configuration has previously been unclear. In this study, a monolayer single&#8208;crystalline MoS&#8322; grown on a sapphire substrate is analyzed, decisively visualizing the atomic structure of the epitaxial interface and elucidating its role in epitaxial growth from an atomic perspective. The findings reveal that the interface consists of a periodic molecular MoO3 interlayer, van der Waals epitaxially grown on a single Al&#8208;terminated sapphire surface. Additionally, it is discovered that MoO3 coverage enhances surface interactions and introduces a unique atomic arrangement with 1&#8208;fold symmetry at the sapphire surface, thereby facilitating the unidirectional alignment of MoS&#8322;. This discovery provides valuable insights into the growth mechanisms leading to single&#8208;crystalline MoS&#8322; formation, and suggests pathways for quantitatively monitoring and controlling growth dynamics, for the improvement of material quality and process repeatability, applicable for single&#8208;crystalline MoS&#8322; or potentially other transition metal dichalcogenides epitaxially grown on sapphire.

         <title>Supercooled Liquids in a Core&#8211;Shell Coordination Structure for Practical Long&#8208;Term Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a unique metal&#8208;organic core&#8211;shell coordination structure, new supercooled liquid materials successfully achieve mutually phase&#8208;stability and controllable phase&#8208;transition in inherent contradictory, for practical long&#8208;term thermal energy storage.








Abstract
Mutual acquisition of phase&#8208;stability and controllable phase&#8208;transition becomes a predominant criterion of phase&#8208;change materials for the practical long&#8208;term energy storage but seems contradictory always. Here a strategy combining coordination and hydrogen bonds hierarchically to create a supercooled liquid in a core&#8211;shell coordination structure is reported, addressing that demand successfully. This new material is composed of a Mn&#8208;methylurea complex (MM) core and the hierarchically bonded erythritols shell. MM glass core with a viscosity of 108 Pa&#183;s determines its thermal phase&#8208;stability. As discovered, the ingenious ligand&#8208;exchange between erythritol and Cl&#8722; ion coordinated with MM core accounts for this effectively reversible phase&#8208;transition. This can be triggered by a small shear&#8208;stress of 10&#160;Pa within tens of seconds, exhibiting good practicability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of phase&#8208;transition are explored.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Scattering Perovskite Scintillator Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution Computed Tomography Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;scattering CsPbBr3 scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging significantly suppresses light scattering and enhances the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. The scintillator array provides a high spatial&#8208;resolution 3D reconstructed tooth image at a low X&#8208;ray dosage in CT imaging.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) imaging has emerge as an effective medical diagnostic technique due to its rapid and 3D imaging capabilities, often employing indirect imaging methods through scintillator materials. Arraying scintillators that can confine light scattering to enable high&#8208;resolution CT imaging remains an area of ongoing exploration for emerging perovskite scintillators. Here an anti&#8208;scattering cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging using a cost&#8208;effective solution&#8208;processed method is reported. Due to the large refractive index contrast between the scintillator and matrix, photon propagation can be well confined within the CsPbBr3 scintillator array to significantly suppress the light scattering and enhance the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. Furthermore, the scintillator array exhibits low&#8208;dosage and high&#8208;resolution CT imaging capability by reconstructing a 3D tooth image with a good spatial resolution of 20.1 lp cm&#8722;1 at a low effective dose of 0.22 mSv. This work highlights that the CsPbBr3 scintillator array is a highly promising candidate for CT imaging.

         <title>Ultrahigh Specific Strength by Bayesian Optimization of Carbon Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization algorithm designs high&#8208;strength nanolattices made of pyrolytic carbon which offer the compressive strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam. This study combines machine learning with nanoscale strengthening and nanoscale 3D printing to achieve unattained material properties with millimeter scalability for light&#8208;weight high&#8208;strength materials.








Abstract
Nanoarchitected materials are at the frontier of metamaterial design and have set the benchmark for mechanical performance in several contemporary applications. However, traditional nanoarchitected designs with conventional topologies exhibit poor stress distributions and induce premature nodal failure. Here, using multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization and two&#8208;photon polymerization, optimized carbon nanolattices with an exceptional specific strength of 2.03&#160;MPa&#160;m3&#160;kg&#8722;1 at low densities &lt;215&#160;kg m&#8722;3 are created. Generative design optimization provides experimental improvements in strength and Young's modulus by as much as 118% and 68%, respectively, at equivalent densities with entirely different lattice failure responses. Additionally, the reduction of nanolattice strut diameters to 300&#160;nm produces a unique high&#8208;strength carbon with a pyrolysis&#8208;induced atomic gradient of 94% sp2 aromatic carbon and low oxygen impurities. Using multi&#8208;focus multi&#8208;photon polymerization, a millimeter&#8208;scalable metamaterial consisting of 18.75 million lattice cells with nanometer dimensions is demonstrated. Combining Bayesian optimized designs and nanoarchitected pyrolyzed carbon, the optimal nanostructures exhibit the strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam offering unparalleled capabilities in light&#8208;weighting, fuel reduction, and contemporary design applications.

         <title>Synergistic Control of Ferroelectric and Optical Properties in Molecular Ferroelectric for Multiplexing Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the synergistic control between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in the molecular ferroelectric material, TMCM&#8208;MnCl3. It demonstrates that FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical writing can trigger FP reversal. This enables a seamless transition between electric&#8208;writing optical&#8208;reading and optical&#8208;writing electrical&#8208;reading modes, hinting at the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory in ferroelectric fields.









Abstract
Utilizing the correlation among diverse physical properties to facilitate multiplexing and multistate memory is anticipated to emerge as an efficient strategy to enhance memory capacity, achieve device miniaturization, and ensure information security. As an important functional material, ferroelectrics have long been considered as a potential candidate in multistate memory devices. Furthermore, the integration of optical response offers an alternative path to realizing multiplexing features, further enhancing the versatility and efficiency of these devices. However, combining ferroelectricity and optical activity is always challenging because ferroelectricity is very sensitive to the crystal structure. In this study, on the correlation between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in molecular ferroelectric material, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese (TMCM&#8208;MnCl3) is reported. This research demonstrated that the FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical illumination can trigger FP reversal. Based on these, both electric&#8208;writing optical&#8208;reading (EWOR) and optical&#8208;writing electrical&#8208;reading (OWER) modes have been conclusively established, and the seamless transition between these two modes can be achieved by adjusting the excitation light intensity. These findings reveal an intriguing physical interconnection and imply the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory functionalities in systems based on ferroelectrics.

Based on these, both electric-writing optical-reading (EWOR) and optical-writing electrical-reading (OWER) modes have been conclusively established, and the seamless transition between these two modes can be achieved by adjusting the excitation light intensity. These findings reveal an intriguing physical interconnection and imply the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory functionalities in systems based on ferroelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The high&#8208;entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 cathode material prepared by ultrafast high temperature shock inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves the reversible and stable multielectron transfer, fabulous cycling stability and excellent wide&#8208;temperature range operation from &#8722;50 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The ultrafast sintering strategy provides a broad platform for the development of polyanionic materials for long&#8208;lifespan and all&#8208;climate sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Avoiding severe structural distortion, irreversible phase transition, and realizing the stabilized multielectron redox are vital for promoting the development of high&#8208;performance NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 (HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP) cathode material is prepared by ultrafast high&#8208;temperature shock, which inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves reversible and stable multielectron transfer of 2.4/2.8 e&#8722; at voltage range of 2.0&#8211;4.45/1.5&#8211;4.45 V versus Na+/Na (the capacity of 137.2/162.0 mAh g&#8722;1). The galvanostatic charge/discharge and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests indicate the sequential redox reactions and approximate solid solution phase transition behavior of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. Density functional theory calculations analyze the migration pathways and energy barriers, further confirming the superior reaction kinetics of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. Accordingly, the HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP exhibits outstanding wide temperature applicability and can operate stably in the temperature range of &#8722;50&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C, accompanied by a capacity retention of 92.8% after 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and a capacity of 73.7 mAh g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. The assembled hard carbon//HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP full&#8208;cell offers an energy density of &#8776;301 Wh kg&#8722;1 based on total cathode and anode active mass, verifying the application feasibility of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. This work provides an innovative and ultrafast pathway to rationally fabricate high&#8208;performance cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>Stress Relaxation for Lead Iodide Nucleation in Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By inducing LiOTf in SnO2/ PbI2, the defects in bulk SnO2 and at the interface are passivated and stress in PbI2 is released, thus reducing the critical Gibbs free energy for mesoporous PbI2 films which leads to highly crystalline perovskite films. Ultimately, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a champion PCE of 25.33% are fabricated.








Abstract
Porous lead iodide (PbI2) film is crucial for the complete reaction between PbI2 and ammonium salts in sequential&#8208;deposition technology so as to achieve high crystallinity perovskite film. Herein, it is found that the tensile stress in tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) is a key factor influencing the morphology and crystallization of PbI2 films. Focusing on this, lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf) is used as an interfacial modifier in the SnO2/PbI2 interface to decrease the tensile stress to reduce the necessary critical Gibbs free energy for PbI2 nuclei formation. The relaxed tensile stress facilitates the more porous PbI2 generation with larger particles and higher roughness, resulting in superior&#8208;quality perovskite films. Besides, this strategy effectively passivates the inherent electron traps of SnO2 and smooths the interfacial energy levels, boosting the charge extraction and transfer. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.33% (25.10% stabilized for 600 s) is achieved. Furthermore, the device demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE at its maximum power point tracking measurement (under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 white light illumination at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C temperature, in N2 atmosphere) after 600 h.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant progress is made in PIBs over the past decade, but the improvements based on half&#8208;cell testing, low mass loading, and low energy density are insufficient for practical applications. This review summarizes the challenges and strategies for PIBs, highlights the importance of further research focusing on full cells, and provides an analysis of their practical application potential.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), with abundant resources and low cost, are considered as a promising alternative to commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale applications. Over the past decade, significant academic progresses are made in the development of PIBs, including advancements in cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. However, most improvements are achieved under laboratory conditions (e.g., K metal&#8208;based half&#8208;cells and low mass loading of active materials), and the performance of PIBs in full cells is still far from the requirements for commercial applications. A critical insight bridging the academic research and the commercialization of PIBs is urgently needed to guide future research in this field. This review will discuss the challenges and improvement strategies in the development of PIBs, focusing on the potential practical cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes, as well as their performance in full cells. It aims to give the readers a clear and logical understanding of the development of PIBs. The application analysis is also discussed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the commercialization potential of PIBs. Finally, perspectives are provided for the future development of PIBs.

         <title>Supramolecular Organic Nanofiller: A New Reinforcement Strategy for Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks Toward Upcycling of Carbon Fiber Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers via asynchronous polymerization is proposed. The reinforcement and recyclability of the supramolecular organic nanofillers on DCPN considerably exceed those of traditional methods. This reinforcement strategy is versatile and can be successfully applied for the upcycling of high&#8208;performance CF composites.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPN) provide an important solution to the challenging recyclability of thermoset elastomers. However, dynamic bonds exhibit relatively weak bond energies, considerably decreasing the mechanical properties of DCPN. Herein, a novel reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers through asynchronous polymerization is proposed. Owing to the difference in the reactivity of the isocyanate groups and the gradual deblocking of aldimine, asynchronous cross&#8208;linking of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isocyanate&#8208;terminated prepolymer containing dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds with the deblocked tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine facilitates the transition from the molecular interpenetration of chains into immiscible polymerization. This results in thermodynamic incompatibility between the hyperbranched clusters and long chains, inducing a spontaneous formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers. Compared to traditional reinforcement strategies, supramolecular organic nanofillers considerably improve the mechanical properties of DCPN. Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions between hyperbranched clusters and dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds enable the network with excellent recyclability. The unique reinforcement and recyclability of the prepared DCPN allow their combination with carbon fibers (CF) to form CF composites with outstanding properties for personal&#8208;protection applications, achieving CF composite upcycling. This study offers a novel strategy on the reinforcement of DCPN and the upcycling of high&#8208;performance CF composites.

A controllable &#8220;oxygen vehicle&#8221; as a versatile nano&#8208;carrier. For co&#8208;delivery with lactate oxidase (LOX) significantly elevated lactate detection rates, triggering a significantly increase in IFN&#8208;&#947; and T cell infiltration. Co&#8208;delivering unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligonucleotide &#65288;CpGODN&#65289; demonstrate a remarkable increase in polarization of macrophages from M2&#8208;like to M1&#8208;like phenotypes, DCs maturation, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia severely limits the antitumor immunotherapy for breast cancer. Although efforts to alleviate tumor hypoxia and drug delivery using diverse nanostructures achieve promising results, the creation of a versatile controllable oxygen&#8208;releasing nano&#8208;platform for co&#8208;delivery with immunostimulatory molecules remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, a versatile oxygen controllable releasing vehicle PFOB@F127@PDA (PFPNPs) is developed, which effectively co&#8208;delivered either protein drug lactate oxidase (LOX) or nucleic acids drug unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligonucleotide (CpG ODNs). Upon photothermal heating, this platform triggered oxygen release, thereby augmenting LOX&#8208;mediated lactate detection rates, and improving T cells infiltrating and cytokine expression. Moreover, under an oxygenated tumor microenvironment (TME), PFPNPs co&#8208;delivered with CpG ODNs effectively reprogrammed the immunosuppressive TME by repolarizing macrophages to an M1&#8208;like phenotype, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and increasing tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells while decreasing the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Our study demonstrated that this controlled oxygen&#8208;releasing platform possessed adaptive drug&#8208;loading capabilities to meet varied immunotherapeutic demands in clinical settings.

         <title>All Light Controlled Five State Logic Gates on a Ferroelectric Ceramic Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel planar three&#8208;electrode structure is constructed on the Ti3+ self&#8208;doping 0.5Ba(Zr0.2TI0.8)O3&#8208;0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT&#8208;BCT) ceramic surface that has an obvious photovoltaic and pyroelectric response. Through a specific polarization method, the device shows a region&#8208;dependent photoelectric response. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are achieved on a single ferroelectric ceramic chip.








Abstract
Differentiating photoelectric response in a single material with a simple approach is desirable for all&#8208;in&#8208;one optoelectronic logical devices. In ferroelectric materials, significantly distinct photoelectric features should be observed if they are in diverse polarization states, unveiling a possible pathway to realize multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates through ferroelectric polarization design. In this study, the Ti3+ self&#8208;doping strategy is first applied to 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3&#8208;0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 ferroelectric ceramics (BZT&#8208;BCT&#8208;xT) through co&#8208;firing metallic Ti powders and BZT&#8208;BCT powders to enhance photoelectric output. Subsequently, on the BZT&#8208;BCT&#8208;3T ceramic surface that has optimal photoelectric properties, three individual regions are separated and heterogeneously polarized by using a novel planar three&#8208;electrodes structure. Intriguing illumination region&#8208;dependent photocurrent directions are demonstrated in this as&#8208;fabricated device. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are integrated into single ferroelectric ceramic via fully light&#8208;controlled methods, including &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221; and &#8220;NOR&#8221;. These gates can be readily switched by simply altering the output electrodes or light intensity of 405&#160;nm LED modulating light. This work not only puts forward an innovative strategy for designing ferroelectric optoelectronic logic gates, but also provides feasibility for more ferroelectric materials to be applied in logical devices.

         <title>A Universal Therapeutic Vaccine Leveraging Autologous Pre&#8208;Existing Immunity to Eliminate in Situ Uniformly Engineered Heterogeneous Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic vaccine overcomes immune evasion and resistance in diverse tumor cells by utilizing the highly immunogenic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD antigen, enhancing antigen presentation via SUSD6 shRNA, and silencing the immune checkpoint gene PD&#8208;L1 through shRNA. It further amplifies RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity with adjuvant&#8208;supported secretion of RBD&#8208;enveloped virus&#8208;like particles, achieving precise and effective eradication of engineered tumor cells.








Abstract
Tumor vaccines that activate the autologous immune system to eliminate tumor cells represent a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, limited antigen selection, insufficient antigen presentation, and the slow onset of de novo immune responses have resulted in poor universality and suboptimal response rates. In contrast, pathogen&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity acquired through infection or vaccination, can rapidly generate a more potent and enduring immune response upon re&#8208;encounter with the same antigen. Here, an adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV)&#8208;based therapeutic vaccine capable of genetically modifying diverse tumor cells to uniformly overexpress and efficiently present the highly immunogenic transmembrane SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and to release RBD&#8208;enveloped virus&#8208;like particles, which awaken and enhance the RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity, leading to significant tumor remission, is engineered. Mechanistically, this therapeutic vaccine leverages the robust RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity and heightened antibody&#8208;mediated phagocytosis to eliminate engineered tumor cells while inducing antigen spreading, thereby provoking a more diverse tumor&#8208;specific cellular immune responses. Notably, widespread administration of vaccines against various pathogens has provided a versatile pool of pre&#8208;existing immunity that can be redirected to eradicate tumors. These findings offer a novel perspective on overcoming the limitations posed by tumor heterogeneity and personalized medicine.

         <title>Engineered Neutrophil Nanovesicles for Inhibiting Corneal Neovascularization by Synergistic Anti&#8208;Inflammatory, Anti&#8208;VEGF, and Chemoexcited Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nanovesicle&#8208;based eye drop for cornea neovascularization treatment has been developed. The nanovesicle inherits the chemotactic and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities of the neutrophils and acts as a drug carrier. By incorporating ranibizumab on its surface and loading photosensitizers into the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane, a synergistic and complementary treatment of cornea neovascularization is achieved by anti&#8208;inflammation, anti&#8208;VEGF, and PDT therapy.








Abstract
Corneal neovascularization (CorNV) develops under various pathological conditions and is one of the main causes of blindness. Due to that CorNV progression involves multiple steps, anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs alone could not sufficiently suppress this process, highlighting an urgent need for an efficient delivery system for the multi&#8208;step management of CorNV. In this study, a neutrophil nanovesicle&#8208;based eye drop (NCCR) is developed for CorNV therapy that simultaneously inhibits angiogenesis and inflammation, while eliminating pathological cells through chemoexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT). NCCR targets inflammatory lesions by leveraging the expression of chemokine receptors from the source cells. Then, NCCR exerts inhibitory effects on the sequential steps of neovascularization. First, it acts as a decoy and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect by neutralizing cytokines via its receptors on the surface of nanovesicles. Second, thioketals bond&#8208;linked ranibizumab is released in the high reactive oxygen species microenvironment of CorNV sites to bind VEGF, inhibiting vascular endothelial cell activation and proliferation. Finally, chemoexcited PDT eliminates preformed corneal blood vessels, disrupting tube formation and pericyte recruitment. The synergistic effects of NCCR on angiogenesis and inflammation, combined with the induction of apoptosis in neovessels via chemoexcited PDT, offer a novel and efficient strategy for CorNV treatment.

Ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus, perovskite film demonstrates more oriented packing during the blade&#8208;coating process. The regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94&#160;cm2.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies. However, perovskite films deposited by blade&#8208;coating usually exhibit inferior film morphology compared to those fabricated by spin&#8208;coating, which hinders the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the scalable perovskite solar modules (PSMs). Herein, ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Compared to unregulated spherical colloids, the ellipsoidal colloids demonstrate more oriented packing during the blade&#8208;coating process, which is due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus. As a result of the improved film morphology, the regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve superior PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94 cm2, and 89% initial PCE after 600&#160;h continuous operation.

         <title>Engineering EVs&#8208;Mediated mRNA Delivery Regulates Microglia Function and Alleviates Depressive&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual delivery system employing extracellular vesicles to mediate the co&#8208;delivery of mRNA and nanozymes exhibits synergistic effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial injury, and their functional crosstalk. This system is capable of regulating microglia function from many aspects, including inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway, inhibiting microglia overactivation, and promoting microglia M2 polarization, and ultimately ameliorates depressive behaviors.









Abstract
The development of new non&#8208;neurotransmitter drugs is an important supplement to the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder. The latest development of mRNA therapy provides the possibility for the treatment of some major diseases. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria constitute a highly interconnected set of fundamental organelles within cells. The interconnection between them forms specific microdomains that play pivotal roles in calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, inflammation, and autophagy. Perturbations in ER&#8208;mitochondrial connections may contribute to the progression of neurological disorders and other diseases. Herein, an extracellular vesicles&#8208;based delivery system, grounded in mRNA gene therapy and integrated with nanomedicine technology is devised. This system is engineered to traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and specifically target the central nervous system (CNS), facilitating the simultaneous delivery of mRNA drugs and metallic nanozymes into the brain. This dual&#8208;pronged approach, targeting ER and mitochondrial crosstalk, inhibits microglial overactivation, promotes M2 polarization of microglia, and suppresses the NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway. Consequently, it significantly alleviates Lipopolysaccharides&#8208;induced neuroinflammatory responses and ameliorates anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors. This study demonstrates a novel antidepressant therapeutic strategy and establishes a new paradigm for mRNA gene therapy in CNS diseases.

         <title>Sargassum Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Fully Ingestible Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using food&#8208;safe sargassum nanocellulose as the binder framework, combined with food&#8208;grade additives, a highly biocompatible fully ingestible supercapacitor is successfully employed. This design introduces high mechanical strength and fast ion transport behavior of the nanofiber, achieving a disposable power supply and electrical stimulation antibacterial in vivo, which provides a promising alternative power source for novel medical electronic devices.








Abstract
Small high&#8208;performance energy modules have significant practical value in the biomedical field, such as painless diagnosis, alleviation of gastrointestinal discomfort, and electrical stimulation therapy. However, due to performance limitations and safety concerns, it is a formidable challenge to design a small, emerging ingestible power supply. Here, a fully ingestible supercapacitor (FISC) constructed of sargassum cellulose nanofiber is presented. FISCs exhibit an electrode areal capacitance of 2.29 F cm&#8722;2 and a high energy density of 307 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, over 90% of the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli is achieved during the self&#8208;discharge process. Therefore, following insertion into an enteric capsule, this device can enable a disposable power supply and electrostimulation for bacteriostasis in the intestine after being swallowed by a human, which offers new possibilities for scientific and simple therapy.

         <title>Microglial&#8208;Biomimetic Memantine&#8208;Loaded Polydopamine Nanomedicines for Alleviating Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microglial&#8208;biomimetic memantine&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanomedicine, PDA&#8208;Mem@M, that achieves blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration and brain inflammation site targeting for rapid and precise treatment of depression is designed. PDA&#8208;Mem@M effectively alleviate depression&#8208;like behaviors. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti&#8208;inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.








Abstract
Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, and monoamine&#8208;based antidepressants as first&#8208;line therapy remain ineffective in some patients. The synergistic modulation of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity could be a major strategy for treating depression. In this study, an inflammation&#8208;targeted microglial biomimetic system, PDA&#8208;Mem@M, is reported for treating depression. Microglial membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier and facilitate microglial targeting. Subsequently, owing to the excellent free radical&#8208;scavenging capacity, PDA&#8208;Mem@M attenuate&#160;the brain inflammatory microenvironment. After on&#8208;demand release from the nanoparticles, memantine increases&#160;the expression of brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factors and reverses&#160;the loss of synaptic dendritic spines. Further, in vivo studies demonstrate that PDA&#8208;Mem@M effectively alleviate&#160;depression&#8208;like behaviors to a greater extent than memantine or polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) monotherapy. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti&#8208;inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.

         <title>An Overview of Flame&#8208;Retardant Materials for Triboelectric Nanogenerators and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of flame&#8208;retardant materials in enhancing the safety and performance of TENG devices, addressing critical challenges in their design and application. It paves the way for researchers and engineers seeking to develop safer, more reliable energy&#8208;harvesting technologies.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have gained significant attention for ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. As the applications of TENG devices expand, their safety and reliability becomes priority, particularly where there is risk of fire or spontaneous combustion. Flame&#8208;retardant materials can be employed to address these safety concerns without compromising the performance and efficiency of TENGs. The primary focus of this review is on flame&#8208;retardant materials, including polymers, biomaterials, liquid polymers, aerogels, and carbon&#8208;based materials. The fundamental properties of these materials for TENG applications are elucidated. The characteristics of each material type are described, along with their potential to boost the safety and performance of TENGs. The importance of flame retardancy in advancing TENG technology can be projected from its usage in wearable electronics, self&#8208;powered sensors, and smart textiles. Current challenges such as material compatibility, fabrication complexity, and environmental concerns are addressed, along with proposed strategies for overcoming them. This review underscores the significance of flame&#8208;retardant materials in strengthening the functionality and safety of TENG devices, paving the way for their widespread adoption across various industries. &#160;

         <title>Linear Dielectric Polymers with Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Crystals for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the pivotal role of ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals in boosting the high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage of polynorbornene dielectrics. This distinctive characteristic enables the polymers to exhibit an impressive high&#8208;temperature discharge energy density of 6.76 J cm&#8722;3, even under electric fields that are far below their Weibull breakdown strength.








Abstract
Achieving optimal capacitive energy storage performance necessitates the integration of high energy storage density, typical of ferroelectric dielectrics, with the low polarization loss associated with linear dielectrics. However, combining these characteristics in a single dielectric material is challenging due to the inherent contradictions between the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric dielectrics and the adaptability of linear dielectrics to changes in the electric field. To address this issue, a linear isotactic sulfonylated polynorbornene dielectric characterized by ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals has been developed. The sulfonyl dipoles in the ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals are oriented in the same direction, thereby enabling this polymer to exhibit a considerable dielectric constant (7.5) at room temperature. Notably, when the operating temperature surpasses the polymer's glass transition temperature (Tg &#8776; 140 &#176;C), its dielectric constant rises to 12 with just minor changes in the dissipation factor. At 150 &#176;C, 90% efficiency of the discharge energy density reaches as high as 6.76 J&#160;cm&#8722;1 under a low electric field of 320 MV m&#8722;1, which is ten times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, high&#8208;temperature, capacitor&#8208;grade polyetherimide. The enhancement of high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, achieved by utilizing the crystallinity of isotactic polymers to form a polar structure, presents a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers.

         <title>Piezoelectric Vitamin&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assemblies for Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically explores piezoelectric response of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies for power generation. Vitamin molecules can self&#8208;assemble into different supramolecular structures exhibiting tunable predicted piezoelectric coefficients. Vitamin B7 D&#8208;biotin (D&#8208;BIO) self&#8208;assemblies with high piezoelectricity are fabricated into piezoelectric devices for human motion monitoring and energy harvesting. These findings will facilitate the exploration and development of biomolecule&#8208;based piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Structural diversity of biomolecules leads to various supramolecular organizations and asymmetric architectures of self&#8208;assemblies with significant piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectricity of biomolecular self&#8208;assemblies has not been fully explored and the relationship between supramolecular structures and piezoelectricity remains poorly understood, which hinders the development of piezoelectric biomaterials. Herein, for the first time, the piezoelectricity of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies for power generation is systematically explored. X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that vitamin molecules can self&#8208;assemble into different supramolecular structures, which exhibited tunable piezoelectric coefficients ranging from 3.8 to 42.8 pC&#160;N&#8722;1 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, vitamin B7 D&#8208;biotin (D&#8208;BIO) self&#8208;assemblies exhibited superior piezoelectricity due to low crystal symmetry and high polarization of supramolecular arrangements. The D&#8208;BIO assemblies&#8208;based piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) produced output voltages of &#8776;0.8 V under a mechanical force of 47 N, showing high mechanical durability after 5400 pressing&#8208;releasing cycles and high stability of at least three months. The PENG&#8208;based wearable sensor successfully detected bending motions of human limbs. Furthermore, the PENG&#8208;based insole converted biomechanical energy into stable electrical energy upon foot movement, illuminating 12 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). This work fills knowledge gaps in piezoelectricity of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies, providing paradigms for realizing high&#8208;performance piezoelectric biomaterials through supramolecular engineering.

Abstract
New types of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials have great potential in solving the current global dilemma on energy, environment, and medical care. Herein, based on two kinds of biomolecule&#8208;MOFs (Bio&#8208;MOFs) with favorable biocompatibility and degradation&#8208;reconstruction characteristics, we have established a self&#8208;powered muti&#8208;functional device to achieve an efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum environmental energy collection and biomedical applications. Combining Zn(II) and carnosine&#8208;based Zn&#8208;Car_MOF possessing a high piezoelectric response (d33 = 11.17 pm V&#8722;1) with patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, a tribo&#8208;piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator (TPHG) is constructed with a synergy output of triboelectric and piezoelectric effects. The Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG demonstrates a high output performance (131&#160;V at 100&#160;kPa) and a wide range of pressure response (1&#160;Pa&#8211;100&#160;kPa), possessing applications in environmental energy collection and biomedical sensors. To expand the application of the wearable device, a conductive hexagonal prism MOF (Cu3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Cu&#8208;HHTP)) is synthesized and employed to load thymol (Thy). Cooperating with Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG, the resulting Cu&#8208;HHTP/Thy can achieve an efficient self&#8208;powered ROS (singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH)) generation and drug synergistic broad&#8208;spectrum sterilization effect (efficiency &#8805; 98%). In a word, the flexible wearable device based on the muti&#8208;functional Bio&#8208;MOFs is sustainable and environmentally friendly, possessing wide application potential in fields of environmental energy collection, biosensors, and self&#8208;powered antibacterial.

         <title>Solvothermal Template&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Porosity in Covalent Organic Frameworks: A Pathway to Enhanced Diffusivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous covalent organic frameworks (hCOFs) are constructed using a solvothermal template&#8208;induced synthetic strategy. Commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles are employed as hard template enabling an increase in total pore volume in a series of COFs. The hierarchically porous nature of hCOFs significantly reduces diffusion limitations, thus leading to simultaneous enhancements in adsorption capacity, diffusivity, and catalytic performance.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in recent years has firmly established them as a new class of molecularly precise and highly tuneable porous materials. However, compared to other porous materials, such as zeolites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, the successful integration of hierarchical porosity into COFs remains largely unexplored. The challenge lies in identifying appropriate synthetic methods to introduce secondary pores without compromising the intrinsic structural porosity of COFs. In this study, a template&#8208;induced synthetic methodology is realized to facilitate the construction of hierarchically porous COFs (hCOFs). This novel approach utilizes commercially available zinc oxide nanoparticles as a hard template, enabling to increase the total pore volume of a series of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs as well as an imine&#8208;based COF while preserving their surface areas. In addition to transmission electron microscopy and gas adsorption analyses, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance techniques are employed to investigate the hierarchical porosity and diffusivity of guest molecules within hCOFs. This study demonstrates that the hierarchically porous nature of hCOFs significantly reduces diffusion limitations, thus leading to simultaneous enhancements in adsorption capacity, diffusivity, and catalytic performance.

         <title>Quantum Dot Luminescence Microspheres Enable Ultra&#8208;Efficient and Bright Micro&#8208;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green and red quantum dot (QD) luminescence microspheres with simultaneous excellent color conversion performance and high photoluminescence stability are synthesized by a facile wet chemical process. They further serve as color conversion materials for the fabrication of green and red micro&#8208;LEDs, which exhibit world&#8208;record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1% and high brightnesses of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;108 and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;107 cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Quantum dot (QD)&#8208;converted micrometer&#8208;scale light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs) are regarded as an effective solution for achieving high&#8208;performance full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED displays because of their narrow&#8208;band emission, simplified mass transfer, facile drive circuits, and low cost. However, these micro&#8208;LEDs suffer from significant blue light leakage and unsatisfactory electroluminescence properties due to the poor light conversion efficiency and stability of the QDs.

&lt;p&gt;Green and red quantum dot (QD) luminescence microspheres with simultaneous excellent color conversion performance and high photoluminescence stability are synthesized by a facile wet chemical process. They further serve as color conversion materials for the fabrication of green and red micro-LEDs, which exhibit world-record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1% and high brightnesses of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum dot (QD)-converted micrometer-scale light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) are regarded as an effective solution for achieving high-performance full-color micro-LED displays because of their narrow-band emission, simplified mass transfer, facile drive circuits, and low cost. However, these micro-LEDs suffer from significant blue light leakage and unsatisfactory electroluminescence properties due to the poor light conversion efficiency and stability of the QDs. Herein, the construction of green and red QD luminescence microspheres with the simultaneously high conversion efficiency of blue light and strong photoluminescence stability are proposed. These luminescence microspheres exhibit high external photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 46% under 450&#160;nm excitation, along with excellent reliability against blue light, heat, and water-oxygen degradation, owing to the waveguide and spatial confinement effects of the microspheres. The microsphere-based green and red micro-LEDs achieve world-record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1%, respectively, and high brightness values of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Finally, 0.6&#160;inch red, green, and blue monochrome micro-LED displays are demonstrated by integrating microsphere-converted micro-LED arrays with thin-film transistor backplanes, which show a pixel resolution as high as 1700 PPI and brightness exceeding 10&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Mechanical information recognition technology, which integrates information acquisition, pre&#8208;processing&#160;and processing, promises to enable applications in intelligent robotics, healthcare, and virtual reality. The mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired to develop mechanical information bionic recognition technology to address the challenges of information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. In this work, bionic strategies for information pre&#8208;processing, acquisition, and processing are summarized systematically. The potential applications, future challenges, and opportunities of MIBRT are also presented.








Abstract
Mechanical information is a medium for perceptual interaction and health monitoring of organisms or intelligent mechanical equipment, including force, vibration, sound, and flow. Researchers are increasingly deploying mechanical information recognition technologies (MIRT) that integrate information acquisition, pre&#8208;processing, and processing functions and are expected to enable advanced applications. However, this also poses significant challenges to information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. The novel and exciting mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired us to develop superior mechanical information bionic recognition technologies (MIBRT) based on novel bionic materials, structures, and devices to address these challenges. Herein, first bionic strategies for information pre&#8208;processing are presented and their importance for high&#8208;performance information acquisition is highlighted. Subsequently, design strategies and considerations for high&#8208;performance sensors inspired by mechanoreceptors of organisms are described. Then, the design concepts of the neuromorphic devices are summarized in order to replicate the information processing functions of a biological nervous system. Additionally, the ability of MIBRT is investigated to recognize basic mechanical information. Furthermore, further potential applications of MIBRT in intelligent robots, healthcare, and virtual reality are explored with a view to solve a range of complex tasks. Finally, potential future challenges and opportunities for MIBRT are identified from multiple perspectives.

         <title>Sole&#8208;Solvent High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte Realizes Wide&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Practical Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte is capable of forming stable anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases, extending the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free sodium batteries with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) are realized. Furthermore, Ah&#8208;level pouch cell delivers a leadingly high energy density (209 Wh kg&#8722;1) and a high capacity retention (83.1%) after 100 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium batteries (AFSBs) hold great promise for high&#8208;density energy storage. However, high&#8208;voltage AFSBs, especially those can stably cycle at a wide temperature range are challenging due to the poor electrolyte compatibility toward both the cathode and anode. Herein, high&#8208;voltage AFSBs with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) are realized for the first time via a sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte based on the diethylene glycol dibutyl ether solvent (D2) and NaPF6 salt. The sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte with unique solvent&#8208;ions effect of strong anion interaction and weak cation solvation enables entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte salt disassociation and high&#8208;concentration contact ion pairs, thus simultaneously forming stable anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases on cathode and anode. Moreover, the wide liquid range of D2 further extends the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, ampere&#8208;hour (Ah)&#8208;level anode&#8208;free sodium pouch cells with cyclability in a wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C are realized. Impressively, the pouch cell achieves a leadingly high cell&#8208;level energy density of 209&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 100 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C. This work provides inspirations for designing advanced electrolytes for practical AFSBs.

         <title>The First Molecular Ferroelectric Mott Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents the design and characterization of first molecular ferroelectric Mott insulator, (C7H14N)3V12O30. Accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 shows a sharp change in conductivity, implying the metal&#8211;insulator transition&#8208;like behavior. This finding opened up new possibilities for the development of strongly correlated electron systems.








Abstract
With the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance materials and high&#8208;temperature superconductors, Mott insulators can potentially undergo a transition from insulating state to metallic state. Here, in molecular ferroelectrics system, a Mott insulator of (C7H14N)3V12O30 has been first synthesized, which is a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic ferroelectric with composition of layered vanadium oxide and quinuclidine ring. Interestingly, accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 changes sharply in conductivity. The occurrence of a Mott transition has been proven by electric transport measurements and theoretical calculations. This research has significantly expanded the applicative horizons of ferroelectric materials, and offering an ideal platform for the investigation of strongly correlated electron systems.

         <title>Microenvironment Mechanical Torque from ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) Micromotors Inhibiting Tumor Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble in situ effectively and introduce mechanical force simulating primary biomechanical into the tiny target spot of TME through wireless magnetic control, which effectively inhibits tumor migration.








Abstract
Mechanical force attracts booming attention with the potential to tune the tumor cell behavior, especially in cell migration. However, the current approach for introducing mechanical input is difficult to apply in vivo. How the mechanical force affects cell behavior in situ also remains unclear. In this work, an intelligent miniaturized platform is constructed with magnetic ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) micromotors. The wireless ZFO can self&#8208;assemble in situ and rotate to generate mechanical torque of biologically relevant piconewton&#8208;scale at the target tumor site. It is observed unexpectedly that enhanced in situ mechanical rotating torque from ZFO micromotors and the active fluid inhibit the migration of highly invasive A549 tumor cells. The down&#8208;regulation of the Piezo1 channel and the suppressed signaling of ROCK1 in mechano&#8208;adaptive tumor cells is found to be related to the inhibition effect. With effectiveness confirmed with the zebrafish xenograft model, this platform provides a valuable toolkit for mechanobiology and force&#8208;associated non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy.

With effectiveness confirmed with the zebrafish xenograft model, this platform provides a valuable toolkit for mechanobiology and force-associated non-invasive tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines advancements in untethered soft robots based on 1D and 2D nanomaterials. It covers basic locomotion forms like crawling, jumping, swimming, rolling, gripping, and multimodal, along with self&#8208;sustained motions like light tracking, self&#8208;oscillating, self&#8208;crawling, self&#8208;rolling, and flying. It also summarizes progress in integrating sensing, energy harvesting, energy storage, self&#8208;healing, and color response into soft actuators.








Abstract
Biological structures exhibit autonomous and intelligent behaviors, such as movement, perception, and responses to environmental changes, through dynamic interactions with their surroundings. Inspired by natural organisms, future soft robots are also advancing toward autonomy, sustainability, and interactivity. This review summarizes the latest achievements in untethered soft robots based on 1D and 2D nanomaterials. First, the performance of soft actuators designed with different structures is compared. Then, the development of basic locomotion forms, including crawling, jumping, swimming, rolling, gripping, and multimodal, mimicking biological motion mechanisms under dynamic stimuli, is discussed. Subsequently, various self&#8208;sustained movements based on imbalance mechanisms under static stimuli are introduced, including light tracking, self&#8208;oscillating, self&#8208;crawling, self&#8208;rolling, and flying. Following that, the progress in soft actuators integrated with additional functionalities such as sensing, energy harvesting, and storage is summarized. Finally, the challenges faced in this field and the prospects for future development are discussed.

         <title>Minute&#8208;Level Room&#8208;Temperature Switching and Long Cycle Stability of Thermochromic Inorganic Perovskite Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible switching between colored and bleached phases of three colors of inorganic perovskite smart windows is induced using dimethyl sulfoxide vapor at room temperature. Compared with normal houses in field tests, the model houses with three colors of smart windows reached a maximum indoor temperature drop of 2.6, 3.6, and 4.2&#160;&#176;C at noon, respectively, showing excellent energy&#8208;saving potential.








Abstract
Perovskite smart windows (PSWs) are widely investigated owing to excellent thermochromic properties, while restricted by poor transition performance and cycle stability. Herein, dimethyl sulfoxide vapor is utilized as an induction reagent for rapid reversible switching at room temperature between the colored and bleached phases. To obtain PSWs with different optical properties and transition performance, red CsPbIBr2, yellow Rb0.5Cs0.5PbIBr2 and brown CsSn0.1Pb0.9IBr2 are prepared through alloying. The perovskites can exhibit reversible switching at 27.4&#8211;34.3&#160;&#176;C within 1.9&#8211;5.1&#160;min. Even after 100 cycles, they exhibit remarkable stability of luminous transmittance (retention &#8805;97.4%) and transition time (retention &#8805;97.6%). Experimental characterization proves that the reversible switching occurs between colored three&#8208;dimension perovskite phase and bleached zero&#8208;dimension perovskite phase. In the field test (air temperature&#160;=&#160;21.6&#8211;26.5&#160;&#176;C), model houses with PSWs exhibit a maximum indoor temperature drop of 4.2&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, they exhibit considerable temperature modulation ability up to 7.9&#160;&#176;C under a solar simulator (temperature of the control model house&#160;=&#160;60&#160;&#176;C). The decrease in the luminous transmittance of the PSWs after 20 days is 2.9%, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability. This study offers PSWs with prominent transition performance and long cycle stability.

         <title>Unconventional Ferroelectric&#8208;Ferroelastic Switching Mediated by Non&#8208;Polar Phase in Fluorite Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ atomic scale transmission electron microscopy experiment reveals a non&#8208;polar phase&#8208;mediated ferroelectric&#8208;ferroelastic coupled switching pathway in fluorite oxides.








Abstract
HfO2/ZrO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics present tremendous potential for next&#8208;generation non&#8208;volatile memory due to their high scalability and compatibility with silicon technology. Unlike the continuous polar layers in perovskite ferroelectrics, HfO2/ZrO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics are composed of alternating polar layers with oxygen shifts and non&#8208;polar spacers, which leads to a distinct ferroelectric switching mechanism. However, directly observing the switching process has been a big challenge due to the polymorph feature of nanoscale fluorites and the difficulty in in situ imaging on light elements. Here, the ferroelectric&#8208;ferroelastic coupled switching process in freestanding ZrO2 thin films is directly visualized by in situ imaging on oxygen motions. A multi&#8208;step 90&#8208;degree polarization switching mechanism is uncovered that challenges the conventional one&#8208;step 180&#8208;degree switching paradigms in fluorite oxides, which is highly consistent with the interlocked nature of ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity. A non&#8208;polar tetragonal (T) phase is discovered as a crucial intermediate state, lowering the energy barrier for polarization switching by 35%. More importantly, the T phase prevents irreversible transitions to the non&#8208;polar ground state and facilitates stable ferroelectric switching. These findings are fundamental to understanding nanoscale polarization switching mechanisms in fluorite ferroelectrics, paving the way for advanced high&#8208;durability devices.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency Through Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Molecular Epitaxial Growth of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks on BiVO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces an innovative method, achieving molecular&#8208;level epitaxial growth of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) on BiVO4 photoanodes by precisely controlling the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The seamless interface of BiVO4/MOF optimizes electron transfer and reduces recombination losses, elevating the overall efficiency of the PEC water oxidation.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface is crucial for high&#8208;performance photoelectrodes, as it directly influences the availability of surface charges for solar water oxidation. However, establishing strong molecular&#8208;level connections between these interfaces to achieve superior interfacial quality presents significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative electrochemical etching method that generates a high concentration of oxygen vacancy sites on BiVO4 surfaces (Ov&#8208;BiVO4), enabling interactions with the oxygen&#8208;rich ligands of MIL&#8208;101. This reduces the formation energy and promotes conformal growth on BiVO4. The Ov&#8208;BiVO4/MIL&#8208;101 composite exhibits an ideal semiconductor/cocatalyst interface, achieving an impressive photocurrent density of 5.91 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 VRHE, along with excellent stability. This high&#8208;performing photoanode enables an unbiased tandem device with an Ov&#8208;BiVO4/MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Si solar cell system, achieving a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 4.33%. The molecular&#8208;level integration mitigates surface states and enhances the internal electric field, facilitating the migration of photogenerated holes into the MIL&#8208;101 overlayer. This process activates highly efficient Fe catalytic sites, which effectively adsorb water molecules, lowering the energy barrier for water oxidation and improving interfacial kinetics. Further studies confirm the broad applicability of oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced molecular epitaxial growth in various MOFs, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for optimizing interfaces and enhancing photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Supramolecular Scale Hydrophilicity Regulation Enabling Efficient Dewatering and Assembly of Nanocellulose into Dense and Strong Bulk Materials as Sustainable Plastic Substitutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dewatering difficulty of nanocellulose dispersion has long been a major challenge hindering its practical utilization. Here, through a supramolecular scale hydrophilicity regulation, the water retention value is substantially decreased and efficient dewatering of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) dispersion is realized, enabling the fabrication of highly dense, strong, fire&#8208;retardant, and moldable CNF bulk materials as sustainable plastic substitutes.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are ideal building blocks for creating lightweight and strong bulk structural materials due to their unique supramolecular structure and exceptional mechanical properties within the crystalline regions. However, assembling CNFs into dense bulk structural materials with customizable shape and functionalities remains a great challenge, hindering their practical applications. Here, the dewatering issue of aqueous CNF dispersions is addressed by regulating supramolecular scale hydrophilicity using lactic acid, combined with hot&#8208;press molding. This approach enables the fabrication of transparent CNF bulk structural materials with a density of up to 1.426&#160;g cm&#8722;3. The mechanical properties, including isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strength (75.5 &#177; 4.5&#160;MPa), flexural strength (198 &#177; 20&#160;MPa), and hardness (&#8776;300&#160;MPa), surpass most engineering plastics. Moreover, unlike conventional CNF based materials, the CNF bulk structural materials exhibit remarkable water stability and flame retardancy. These unique advantages open a new avenue to bottom&#8208;up assembly of CNFs into high&#8208;performance multifunctional eco&#8208;friendly structural materials, dedicating to substitution of plastics and easing the consumption of petrochemical resources.

         <title>Fluorine Doping&#8208;Assisted Reconstruction of Isolated Cu Sites for CO2 Electroreduction Toward Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine (F) doping is an efficient strategy to facilitate the in situ aggregation of Cu single atoms and stabilize Cu+ species. Consequently, the F&#8208;doped Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction toward multicarbon products, achieving ultrahigh Cu utilization. This is attributed to the formation of abundant Cu nanocrystals with a high ratio of stable Cu+ species.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of multicarbon compounds from CO2 is a promising method for storing renewable electricity and addressing global CO2 issues. Single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising candidates for CO2 reduction, but producing high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) products using a single&#8208;atom structure remains a significant challenge. In this study, a fluorine doping strategy is proposed to facilitate the reconstruction of isolated Cu atoms, promoting multicarbon generation. The in situ formed Cu nanocrystals contain a substantial amount of stable Cu+ species, demonstrating remarkable activity for CO2&#8722;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion. Notably, they achieve the highest Cu utilization, with a C2+ partial current density of &#8722;2.01 A mgper Cu&#8722;1and a C2+ formation rate of 7.03&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mgper Cu&#8722;1at &#8776;&#8722;1&#160;V versus RHE. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations confirm the crucial role of fluorine atoms in structural evolution and electrolysis.

         <title>Novel Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Free Switching Behavior in vdW&#8208;Magnet/Oxide Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, current&#8208;driven magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching is realized in an unprecedented combination of a van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals/oxide heterostructure, with novel underlying mechanisms of precession&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization and consequent unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque. It demonstrates a novel approach to utilize both the interface and large Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling and opens a new realm by combining burgeoning van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals magnets and superior oxide spintronics.








Abstract
Magnetization switching by charge current without a magnetic field is essential for device applications and information technology. It generally requires a current&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization beyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy&#8208;metal systems, where the current&#8208;induced spin polarization aligns in&#8208;plane orthogonal to the in&#8208;plane charge current and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin current. Here, a new approach is demonstrated for magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching by fabricating a van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3 heterostructure. This new magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching is possible because the current&#8208;driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interface precess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing an ultimate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. This interpretation is further confirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in&#8208;plane initialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals magnet and oxide are successfully combined for the first time, especially taking advantage of spin&#8208;orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allows this study to establish a new way of magnetic field&#8208;free switching. This work demonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of large spin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and in doing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals magnets and oxide spintronics.

         <title>Resonantly Enhanced Hybrid Wannier&#8211;Mott&#8211;Frenkel Excitons in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Van Der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excitonic scenario depends sensitively on the interfacial molecular orientation at an organic&#8211;inorganic CuPc/MoSe2 heterostructure interface. At face&#8208;on orientation, due to interfacial hybridization, a new type of hybrid Wannier&#8211;Mott&#8211;Frenkel exciton is observed, which exhibits large oscillator strength and the signatures of Wannier&#8211;Mott and Frenkel excitons simultaneously, providing a promising platform for many&#8208;body exciton physics, ultrasensitive molecular detection, and optoelectrical applications.








Abstract
Hybrid excitons formed via resonant hybridization in 2D material heterostructures feature both large optical and electrical dipoles, providing a promising platform for many&#8208;body exciton physics and correlated electronic states. However, hybrid excitons at organic&#8211;inorganic interface combining the advantages of both Wannier&#8211;Mott and Frenkel excitons remain elusive. Here, hybrid excitons are reported in the copper phthalocyanine/molybdenum diselenide (CuPc/MoSe2) heterostructure (HS) featuring strong molecular orientation dependence by low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy. The hybrid Wannier&#8211;Mott&#8211;Frenkel excitons exhibit a large oscillator strength and display signatures of the Frenkel excitons in CuPc and the Wannier&#8211;Mott excitons in MoSe2 simultaneously through the delocalized electrons. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm the strong hybridization between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CuPc and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of MoSe2. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane molecular orientation is further employed to tune the hybridization strength and tailor the hybrid exciton states. The results reveal the hybrid excitons at the CuPc/MoSe2 interface with tunability by molecular orientation, suggesting that the organic&#8211;inorganic HS constitutes a promising platform for many&#8208;body exciton physics such as exciton condensation and optoelectrical applications.

&lt;p&gt;The excitonic scenario depends sensitively on the interfacial molecular orientation at an organic&#8211;inorganic CuPc/MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure interface. At face-on orientation, due to interfacial hybridization, a new type of hybrid Wannier&#8211;Mott&#8211;Frenkel exciton is observed, which exhibits large oscillator strength and the signatures of Wannier&#8211;Mott and Frenkel excitons simultaneously, providing a promising platform for many-body exciton physics, ultrasensitive molecular detection, and optoelectrical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid excitons formed via resonant hybridization in 2D material heterostructures feature both large optical and electrical dipoles, providing a promising platform for many-body exciton physics and correlated electronic states. However, hybrid excitons at organic&#8211;inorganic interface combining the advantages of both Wannier&#8211;Mott and Frenkel excitons remain elusive. Here, hybrid excitons are reported in the copper phthalocyanine/molybdenum diselenide (CuPc/MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) heterostructure (HS) featuring strong molecular orientation dependence by low-temperature photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy. The hybrid Wannier&#8211;Mott&#8211;Frenkel excitons exhibit a large oscillator strength and display signatures of the Frenkel excitons in CuPc and the Wannier&#8211;Mott excitons in MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously through the delocalized electrons. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm the strong hybridization between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CuPc and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The out-of-plane molecular orientation is further employed to tune the hybridization strength and tailor the hybrid exciton states. The results reveal the hybrid excitons at the CuPc/MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface with tunability by molecular orientation, suggesting that the organic&#8211;inorganic HS constitutes a promising platform for many-body exciton physics such as exciton condensation and optoelectrical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oriented Molecular Dipole&#8208;Enabled Modulation of NiOx/Perovskite Interface for Pb&#8208;Sn Mixed Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance Pb&#8208;Sn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells are achieved by introducing a 4&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid dipole interlayer at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The oriented dipole interlayer modulates energy level alignment, inhibits interface redox reactions, and improves perovskite quality. The resulting device achieves a champion efficiency of 17.4%, while also demonstrating excellent UV&#8208;radiation resistance and operational stability.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is considered as a potential hole transport material in the fabrication of lead&#8208;tin (Pb&#8208;Sn) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for tandem applications. However, the energy level mismatch and unfavorable redox reactions between Ni&#8805;3+ species and Sn2+ at the NiOx/perovskite interface pose challenges. Herein, high&#8208;performance Pb&#8208;Sn&#8208;based inorganic PSCs are demonstrated by modulating the NiOx/perovskite interface with a multifunctional 4&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;ABSA) interlayer. The 4&#8208;ABSA interlayer induces the formation of an oriented dipole moment directed from NiOx to perovskite, effectively elevating the valance band maximum of the NiOx film, thus balancing the energy level difference and promoting charge carrier extraction of the device. Moreover, the 4&#8208;ABSA molecules interact with both NiOx and perovskite, suppressing the reaction of highly active Ni&#8805;3+ species with perovskites while regulating perovskite crystallization. This results in perovskite films with reduced defect density and enlarged grains. Consequently, a remarkable device efficiency of 17.4% is obtained, representing the highest reported value for Pb&#8208;Sn&#8208;based inorganic PSCs thus far. Furthermore, the 4&#8208;ABSA interlayer enhances the UV&#8208;radiation and operational stability of the resulting devices, maintaining over 80% and 90% of the initial efficiency after 240&#160;h of UV&#8208;light exposure and 480&#160;h of 1 sun illumination, respectively.

         <title>Synergistic Adhesion and Shape Deformation in Nanowire&#8208;Structured Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer films with dense nanowire arrays exhibit synergistic adhesion and shape&#8208;changing properties. They curl toward the nanowire side under heat or chemical vapors but away from it with liquid droplets. Chemical modifications make them superoleophobic underwater, enabling precise droplet manipulation. This biomimetic design integrates enhanced adhesion with stimuli&#8208;responsive deformation, with promising applications in soft robotics and adaptive surfaces.








Abstract
Nature provides many examples of the benefits of nanoscopic surface structures in areas of adhesion and antifouling. Herein, the design, fabrication, and characterization of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films are presented with nanowire surface structures that exhibit tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive deformations and enhanced adhesion properties. The LCE films are shown to curl toward the side with the nanowires when stimulated by heat or organic solvent vapors. In contrast, when a droplet of the same solvent is placed on the film, it curls away from the nanowire side due to nanowire&#8208;induced capillary forces that cause unequal swelling. This characteristic curling deformation is shown to be reversible and can be optimized to match curved substrates, maximizing adhesive shear forces. By using chemical modification, the LCE nanowire films can be given underwater superoleophobicity, enabling oil repellency under a range of harsh conditions. This is combined with the nanowire&#8208;induced frictional asymmetry and the reversible shape deformation to create an underwater droplet mixing robot, capable of performing chemical reactions in aqueous environments. These findings demonstrate the potential of nanowire&#8208;augmented LCE films for advanced applications in soft robotics, adaptive adhesion, and easy chemical modification, with implications for designing responsive materials that integrate mechanical flexibility with surface functionality.

         <title>Creating Single Atomic Coordination for Hypoxia&#8208;Resistant Pyroptosis Nano&#8208;Inducer to Boost Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) that inherit the single atomic Fe&#8211;N4 center of hemin while creating sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon surroundings were created by a simple solvothermal treatment of hemin. HNCDs synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I, thus can significantly induce tumor pyroptosis and evoke strong antitumor immune response even under hypoxic environment.









Abstract
General synthesis and mechanical understanding of type I nano&#8208;photosensitizers are of great importance for hypoxia&#8208;resistant pyroptosis inducers. Herein, a simple solvothermal treatment is developed to convert non&#8208;photosensitive small molecules (hemin) into uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) with strong type I photodynamic activity and red fluorescence emission. These HNCDs inherit the single atomic Fe&#8211;N4 center of hemin while creating sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon surroundings, which synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I. After encapsulating HNCDs with bovine serum albumin (BSA)&#160;to facilitate in vivo applications, the resulting BSA nanoparticles (HB) can image tumors and significantly induce the pyroptosis of tumor cells even under an extremely hypoxic environment (2% O2). This evokes a strong antitumor immune response, effectively restraining tumor growth and lung metastasis in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer mice, with good biocompatibility. This work introduces an applicable pyroptosis nano&#8208;inducer to combat hypoxic tumors and highlights the regulation of Fe&#8211;N4 centers to develop hypoxia&#8208;resistant type I nano&#8208;photosensitizers for cancer treatment.

         <title>Hybrid Soft Segments Boost the Development of Ultratough Thermoplastic Elastomers with Tunable Hardness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hardness of a polymer material greatly affects its applicability, but traditionally, increasing hardness tends to reduce toughness. This study introduces a hybrid soft segment strategy that effectively regulates the hardness of thermoplastic elastomers without compromising their inherent toughness, enhancing their safety and structural integrity for broader applications.








Abstract
The hardness of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) significantly influences their suitability for various applications, but traditionally, enhancing hardness reduces toughness. Herein a method is introduced that leverages hybrid soft segments to fine&#8208;tune the hardness of TPEs without compromising their exceptional toughness. Through the selective copolymerization of polytetramethylene ether glycols (PTMEGs) at various molecular weights, supramolecular poly(urethane&#8208;urea) TPEs are molecularly engineered to cover a wide spectrum of hardness while retaining good toughness. It is achieved through the formation of graded functional zones&#8212;densely packed for enhanced hardness and strength, and loosely packed for greater extensibility and toughness&#8212;driven by variations in PTMEG chain length and mismatched supramolecular interactions. Through the establishment and systematic investigation of a TPE library, the intricate interplay between design, structure, and performance of these materials is elucidated, refining the optimization techniques. The TPEs demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including a variant with a Shore hardness of 86A and a toughness of 819&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, alongside a softer variant with a 59A hardness and a 786&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 toughness. The innovation extends to a scalable solvent&#8208;based TPE production line, promising widespread industrial application. This advancement reimagines the potential of high&#8208;performance TPEs and composites, offering versatile materials for demanding applications.

         <title>Destabilization of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Characterization, Mechanisms, and Regeneration Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), identifying five deactivation pathways across seven destabilization scenarios and detailing three key regeneration strategies. It introduces advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques relevant to these processes. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing stable and efficient SACs for energy applications.








Abstract
Numerous in situ characterization studies have focused on revealing the catalytic mechanisms of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), providing a theoretical basis for their rational design. Although research is relatively limited, the stability of SACs under long&#8208;term operating conditions is equally important and a prerequisite for their real&#8208;world energy applications, such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Recently, there has been a rise in in situ characterization studies on the destabilization and regeneration of SACs; however, timely and comprehensive summaries that provide the catalysis community with valuable insights and research directions are still lacking. This review summarizes recent advances in the destabilization mechanisms and regeneration strategies of SACs, specifically highlighting various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques employed in the studies. The factors that induce destabilization in SACs are identified by discussing the failure of active sites, coordination environments, supports, and reaction conditions under long&#8208;term operating scenarios. Next, the primary regeneration strategies for SACs are introduced, including redispersion, surface poison desorption, and exposure of subsurface active sites. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of both in situ and ex situ characterization techniques are discussed. Finally, future research directions are proposed, aimed at constructing structure&#8211;stability relationships and guiding the design of more stable SACs.

         <title>Metalloparticle&#8208;Engineered Pickering Emulsion Displaying AAV&#8208;Vectored Vaccine for Enhancing Antigen Expression and Immunogenicity Against Pathogens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pickering emulsion is stabilized by biomineralized manganese nanoparticles and aluminum hydroxide, enabling rapid and efficient loading of AAVs, diversifying AAV endocytic pathways, and further activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway for higher AAV target gene expression and stronger cellular immune responses.









Abstract
Recombinant adeno&#8208;associated viruses (rAAVs) have emerged as promising vaccine vectors due to their enduring efficacy with a single dose. However, insufficient cellular immune responses and the random and non&#8208;specific distribution of AAVs post&#8208;injection may hinder the development of AAV vaccines. Here, a novel Pickering emulsion platform stabilized by biomineralized manganese nanoparticles and aluminum hydroxide, which can rapidly and efficiently load AAVs, is reported. This platform confers AAVs with favorable in vivo distribution kinetics, diversifying AAV endocytic pathways with reduced dependency on the sialic acid receptor&#8208;mediated route, and ultimately enhancing AAV infection efficiency in antigen present cells (APCs). Concurrently, the Pickering emulsion substantially boosts endogenous 2&#8242;3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP production, further activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway for stronger immune responses and improving protective efficacy in bacterial infection models. The STING pathway activation also increases AAV target gene expression, potently augmenting the cross&#8208;protective potential of AAV vaccines for COVID&#8208;19. These synergistic effects ensure that effective immune responses are induced even at one&#8208;fifth of the AAV vaccination dose, while the Pickering emulsion further reduces the accumulation of AAV in the liver, thereby improving their safety. The findings highlight the potential of Pickering emulsions as valuable enhancers for viral vectors, providing insights for their broader clinical applicability.

         <title>Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics for Wearable Near&#8208;Sensor and In&#8208;Sensor Computing Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the flexible bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems, classified into near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing, is addressed. Fundamental aspects, including biological processes, required components, and the device types for each component, as well as applications for wearable systems, are discussed. Additionally, perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics are provided.








Abstract
Flexible neuromorphic architectures that emulate biological cognitive systems hold great promise for smart wearable electronics. To realize neuro&#8208;inspired sensing and computing electronics, artificial sensory neurons that detect and process external stimuli must be integrated with central nervous systems capable of parallel computation. In near&#8208;sensor computing, synaptic devices, and sensors are used to emulate sensory neurons and receptors, respectively. In contrast, in in&#8208;sensor computing, a single multifunctional device serves as both the receptor and neuron. Bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems efficiently detect and process stimuli through data structuring techniques, significantly reducing data volume and enabling the extension of neuromorphic applications to smart wearable systems. To construct wearable near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing, it is crucial to develop artificial sensory neurons and central nervous synapses that replicate the biological functionalities. Additionally, the integrated systems must exhibit high mechanical flexibility and integration density. This review addresses research on flexible bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems, classified into near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing. It covers fundamental aspects, including biological cognitive processes, the required components, and the structures for each component, as well as applications for wearable smart systems. Finally, it offers perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics in smart wearable systems connected to the next&#8208;generation Internet of Things.

Scalable synaptic transistor memory from solution&#8208;processed carbon nanotubes, exhibiting&#160;reconfigurable weights and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity, enables parallel neuromorphic data processing with a speed of 1 M bit per second per input channel.








Abstract
Neural networks as a core information processing technology in machine learning and artificial intelligence demand substantial computational resources to deal with the extensive multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. Neuromorphic computing is an emergent solution to address this problem, allowing the computation performed in memory arrays in parallel with high efficiencies conforming to the neural networks. Here, scalable synaptic transistor memories are developed from solution&#8208;sorted carbon nanotubes. The transistors exhibit a large switching ratio of over 105, a significant memory window of &#8776;12&#160;V arising from charge trapping, and low response delays down to tens of nanoseconds. These device characteristics endow highly stabilized reconfigurable conductance states, successful emulation of synaptic functions, and a high data processing speed. Importantly, the devices exhibit uniform characteristic metrics, e.g., with a 1.8% variation in the memory window, suggesting an industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing capability of the fabrication. Using the memories, a hardware convolution kernel is designed and parallel image processing is demonstrated at a speed of 1&#160;M bit per second per input channel. Given the efficacy of the convolution kernel, a promising prospect of the memories in implementing neuromorphic computing is envisaged. To explore the potential, large&#8208;scale convolution kernels are simulated and high&#8208;speed video processing is realized for autonomous driving.

         <title>Magnesium Nanocomposite Hydrogel Reverses the Pathologies to Enhance Mandible Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative design offers an injectable bone substitute that addresses various detrimental pathologies associated with medication&#8208;related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). It promotes vascularization, reduces inflammation, activates stem cells, and inhibits pathogens. The convenient implantation, assistance in blood clotting, and robust osteopromotive effects make it a promising solution for filling irregular bone defects and realizing functional regeneration.








Abstract
The healing of bone defects after debridement in medication&#8208;related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a challenging medical condition with impaired angiogenesis, susceptible infection, and pro&#8208;inflammatory responses. Magnesium (Mg) nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to specifically tackle multiple factors involved in MRONJ. Mg&#8208;oxide nanoparticles tune the gelation kinetics in the reaction between N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide&#8208;functionalized hyperbranched poly (ethylene glycol) and proteins. This reaction allows an enhanced mechanical property after instant solidification and, more importantly, also stable gelation in challenging environments such as wet and hemorrhagic conditions. The synthesized hydrogel guides mandible regeneration in MRONJ rats by triggering the formation of type H vessels, activating Osterix+ osteoprogenitor cells, and generating anti&#8208;inflammatory microenvironments. Additionally, this approach demonstrates its ability to suppress infection by inhibiting specific pathogens while strengthening stress tolerance in the affected alveolar bone. Furthermore, the enhanced osteogenic properties and feasibility of implantation of the hydrogel are validated in mandible defect and iliac crest defect created in minipigs, respectively. Collectively, this study offers an injectable and innovative bone substitute to enhance mandible defect healing by tackling multiple detrimental pathologies.

&lt;p&gt;The innovative design offers an injectable bone substitute that addresses various detrimental pathologies associated with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). It promotes vascularization, reduces inflammation, activates stem cells, and inhibits pathogens. The convenient implantation, assistance in blood clotting, and robust osteopromotive effects make it a promising solution for filling irregular bone defects and realizing functional regeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing of bone defects after debridement in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a challenging medical condition with impaired angiogenesis, susceptible infection, and pro-inflammatory responses. Magnesium (Mg) nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to specifically tackle multiple factors involved in MRONJ. Mg-oxide nanoparticles tune the gelation kinetics in the reaction between N-hydroxysuccinimide-functionalized hyperbranched poly (ethylene glycol) and proteins. This reaction allows an enhanced mechanical property after instant solidification and, more importantly, also stable gelation in challenging environments such as wet and hemorrhagic conditions. The synthesized hydrogel guides mandible regeneration in MRONJ rats by triggering the formation of type H vessels, activating Osterix+ osteoprogenitor cells, and generating anti-inflammatory microenvironments. Additionally, this approach demonstrates its ability to suppress infection by inhibiting specific pathogens while strengthening stress tolerance in the affected alveolar bone. Furthermore, the enhanced osteogenic properties and feasibility of implantation of the hydrogel are validated in mandible defect and iliac crest defect created in minipigs, respectively. Collectively, this study offers an injectable and innovative bone substitute to enhance mandible defect healing by tackling multiple detrimental pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transcriptome&#8208;Optimized Hydrogel Design of a Stem Cell Niche for Enhanced Tendon Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a pioneering materiomics approach to rationally design a stem cell&#8208;laden hydrogel (TenoGel) for tendon repair. Unlike traditional biomaterial empiricism, this systematic, data&#8208;driven strategy integrates RNA&#8208;seq bioinformatics and mathematical modeling, providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights with quantitative assessment and prediction of optimal tenogenic design parameters. This presents a transformative advancement in biomaterial engineering for regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Bioactive hydrogels have emerged as promising artificial niches for enhancing stem cell&#8208;mediated tendon repair. However, a substantial knowledge gap remains regarding the optimal combination of niche features for targeted cellular responses, which often leads to lengthy development cycles and uncontrolled healing outcomes. To address this critical gap, an innovative, data&#8208;driven materiomics strategy is developed. This approach is based on in&#8208;house RNA&#8208;seq data that integrates bioinformatics and mathematical modeling, which is a significant departure from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods. It aims to provide both mechanistic insights and quantitative assessments and predictions of the tenogenic effects of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells induced by systematically modulated features of a tendon&#8208;mimetic hydrogel (TenoGel). The knowledge generated has enabled a rational approach for TenoGel design, addressing key considerations, such as tendon extracellular matrix concentration, uniaxial tensile loading, and in vitro pre&#8208;conditioning duration. Remarkably, our optimized TenoGel demonstrated robust tenogenesis in vitro and facilitated tendon regeneration while preventing undesired ectopic ossification in a rat tendon injury model. These findings shed light on the importance of tailoring hydrogel features for efficient tendon repair. They also highlight the tremendous potential of the innovative materiomics strategy as a powerful predictive and assessment tool in biomaterial development for regenerative medicine.

         <title>Extracellular Silica Nanomatrices Promote In Vitro Maturation of Anti&#8208;tumor Dendritic Cells via Activation of Focal Adhesion Kinase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanozigzags (NZs) facilitate the in vitro maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) via mechanoactivation of focal adhesion kinase. The NZ&#8208;maturated DCs in vitro prime the cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes (CTLs) into the programmed cell death protein&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)lowCD44high effector memory CTLs, and in vivo suppress the growth of tumors, indicating a promising new strategy for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The efficacy of dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based cancer vaccines is critically determined by the functionalities of in vitro maturated DCs. The maturation of DCs typically relies on chemicals that are cytotoxic or hinder the ability of DCs to efficiently activate the antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes (CTLs) against tumors. Herein, the maturation chemicals are replaced with extracellular silica nanomatrices, fabricated by glancing angle deposition, to promote in vitro maturation of murine bone marrow&#8208;derived DCs (mBMDCs). The extracellular nanomatrices composed of silica nanozigzags (NZs) enable the generation of mature mBMDCs with upregulated levels of co&#8208;stimulatory molecules, C&#8208;C chemokine receptor type&#8208;7, X&#8208;C motif chemokine recetpor&#8208;1, DC&#8208;specific ICAM&#8208;3 grabbing nonintegrin, and enhanced endocytic capacity. The in vitro maturation is partially governed by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that is mechanically activated in the curved cell adhesions formed at the DC&#8208;NZ interfaces. The NZ&#8208;maturated mBMDCs can prime the antigen&#8208;specific CTLs into programmed cell death protein&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)lowCD44high memory phenotypes in vitro and suppress the growth of tumors in vivo. Meanwhile, the NZ&#8208;mediated beneficial effects are also observed in human monocyte&#8208;derived DCs. This work demonstrates that the silica NZs promote the anti&#8208;tumor capacity of in vitro maturated DCs via the mechanoactivation of FAK, supporting the potential of silica NZs being a promising biomaterial for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Angular&#8208;Inertia Regulated Stable and Nanoscale Sensing of Single Molecules Using Nanopore&#8208;In&#8208;A&#8208;Tube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>

The study develops a nanopore&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;tube (NIAT) device that precisely regulates molecule translocation in a funnel&#8208;shaped nanopore by controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed in a centrifuge. This ensures stable signal readout with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling nanoscale sensing of single molecules.








Abstract
Nanopore is commonly used for high&#8208;resolution, label&#8208;free sensing, and analysis of single molecules. However, controlling the speed and trajectory of molecular translocation in nanopores remains challenging, hampering sensing accuracy. Here, the study proposes a nanopore&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;tube (NIAT) device that enables decoupling of the current signal detection from molecular translocation and provides precise angular inertia&#8208;kinetic translocation of single molecules through a nanopore, thus ensuring stable signal readout with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, the funnel&#8208;shaped silicon nanopore, fabricated at a 10&#8208;nm resolution, is placed into a centrifugal tube. A light&#8208;induced photovoltaic effect is utilized to achieve a counter&#8208;balanced state of electrokinetic effects in the nanopore. By controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed, the angular inertial force is harnessed effectively for regulating the translocation process with high precision. Consequently, the speed and trajectory of the molecules are able to be adjusted in and around the nanopore, enabling controllable and high SNR current signals. Numerical simulation reveals the decisive role of inertial angle in achieving uniform translocation trajectories and enhancing analyte&#8208;nanopore interactions. The performance of the device is validated by discriminating rigid Au nanoparticles with a 1.6&#8208;nm size difference and differentiating a 1.3&#8208;nm size difference and subtle stiffness variations in flexible polyethylene glycol molecules.

         <title>Photo&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy: Fabricating Chromium&#8208;Based Nanocomposites to Enhance CAR&#8208;T Cell Infiltration and Cytotoxicity against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium nanoparticles (Cr NPs) coated with a layer of biodegradable polydopamine can empower the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy against solid tumors. Upon laser irradiation, the induced hyperthermia can &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME) and boost the therapeutic effect of CAR&#8208;T cells. The Cr3+ ions released can also promote the CAR&#8208;T cell migration and infiltration for effective inhibition of tumor growth in tumor&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
The infiltration and cytotoxicity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cells are crucial for effective elimination of solid tumors. While metallo&#8208;immunotherapy is a promising strategy that can activate the antitumor immunity, its role in promoting CAR&#8208;T cell therapy remains elusive. The first single&#8208;element nanomaterial based on chromium nanoparticles (Cr NPs) for cancer photo&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy has been reported previously. Herein, an extended study using biodegradable polydopamine as a versatile carrier for these nanoparticles, enabling synergistic CAR&#8208;T cell therapy, is reported. The results show that these nanocomposites with or without further encapsulation of the anticancer drug alpelisib can promote the CAR&#8208;T cell migration and antitumor effect. Upon irradiation with near&#8208;infrared light, they caused mild hyperthermia that can &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME). The administration of B7&#8208;H3 CAR&#8208;T cells to NOD severe combined immunodeficiency gamma mice bearing a human hepatoma or PIK3CA&#8208;mutated breast tumor can significantly inhibit the tumor growth after the induction of tumor hyperthermia by the nanocomposites and promote the secretion of serum cytokines, including IL&#8208;2, IFN&#8208;&#947;, and TNF&#8208;&#945;. The trivalent Cr3+ ions, which are the major degradation product of these nanocomposites, can increase the CXCL13 and CCL3 chemokine expressions to generate tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the tumor tissues, facilitating the CAR&#8208;T cell infiltration.

Upon irradiation with near-infrared light, they caused mild hyperthermia that can &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME). The administration of B7-H3 CAR-T cells to NOD severe combined immunodeficiency gamma mice bearing a human hepatoma or PIK3CA-mutated breast tumor can significantly inhibit the tumor growth after the induction of tumor hyperthermia by the nanocomposites and promote the secretion of serum cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-&#947;, and TNF-&#945;. The trivalent Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which are the major degradation product of these nanocomposites, can increase the CXCL13 and CCL3 chemokine expressions to generate tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the tumor tissues, facilitating the CAR-T cell infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nano&#8208;electromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Fabrication&#8208;disorder&#8208;induced random frequency variation can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate. These results represent an important advance in topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.








Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nano&#8208;electromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefits the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. These results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Homing Phage Nanofibers for Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Targeted Breast Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically engineered phages display a nanozyme&#8208;nucleating peptide on the sidewall and a tumor&#8208;homing peptide at the tip. They site&#8208;specifically nucleate Pt nanozyme on the sidewall. The resultant phages can home to breast tumor and catalyze the conversion of tumoral hydrogen peroxide into oxygen. This strategy solves the problem of tumor hypoxia and improves the efficacy of photodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) eliminates cancer cells by converting endogenous oxygen into reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, its efficacy is significantly hindered by hypoxia in solid tumors. Hence, to engineer filamentous fd phage, a human&#8208;friendly bacteria&#8208;specific virus is proposed, into a nanozyme&#8208;nucleating photosensitizer&#8208;loaded tumor&#8208;homing nanofiber for enhanced production of ROS in a hypoxic tumor. Specifically, Pt&#8208;binding and tumor&#8208;homing peptides are genetically displayed on the sidewall and tip of the fd phage, respectively. The Pt&#8208;binding peptides induced nucleation and orientation of Pt nanozymes (PtNEs) on the sidewall of the phage. The resultant PtNE&#8208;coated tumor&#8208;homing phage exhibits significantly enhanced sustained catalytic conversion of hydrogen peroxide in hypoxic tumors into O2 for producing ROS needed for PDT, compared to non&#8208;phage&#8208;templated PtNE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify the catalytic mechanism of the phage&#8208;templated PtNE. After intravenous injection of the PtNE&#8208;coated indocyanine green (ICG)&#8208;loaded tumor&#8208;homing phages into breast tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the nanofibers home to the tumors and effectively inhibit tumor growth by the PtNE&#8208;enhanced PDT. The nanofibers can also serve as a tumor&#8208;homing imaging probe due to the fluorescence of ICG. This work demonstrates that filamentous phage, engineered to become tumor&#8208;homing nanozyme&#8208;nucleating tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;relieving nanofibers, can act as cancer&#8208;targeting nanozymes with improved catalytic performance for effective targeted PDT.

Magnesium Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Inspired by &#8220;Jingwei Reclamation&#8221;, the cover with a phoenix, symbolizes nirvana and rebirth, representing hope and resilience in challenging environments. The phoenix utilizes magnesium nanocomposite hydrogel as a &#8220;stone&#8221; to fill the vast sea that represents challenging mandible defects. The surrounding mountains intricately portray the structure of trabecular bones. The shape of phoenix and hydrogel looks like &#8220;60&#8221;, celebrating the 60th anniversary of CUHK. More details can be found in article number 2312920 by Ling Qin, Jiankun Xu, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>3D Nanofabrication via Directed Material Assembly: Mechanism, Method, and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided material assembly, as an important mechanism of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanofabrication, has led to breakthroughs in fabrication resolution, material generality, and throughput, and enabled numerous new opportunities for nanotechnology. This review summarizes recent advances in this promising strategy with an emphasis on the synergy among different microscopic driving forces with different regioselective designs to achieve nanoscale assembly precision and sophisticated 3D structure design.








Abstract
Fabrication of complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures at nanoscale is the core of nanotechnology, as it enables the creation of various micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;devices such as micro&#8208;robots, metamaterials, sensors, photonic devices, etc. Among most 3D nanofabrication strategies, the guided material assembly, an efficient bottom&#8208;up approach capable of directly constructing designed structures from precise integration of material building blocks, possesses compelling advantages in diverse material compatibility, sufficient driving forces, facile processing steps, and nanoscale resolution. In this review, we focus on assembly&#8208;based fabrication methods capable of creating complex 3D nanostructures (instead of periodic or 2.5D&#8208;only structures). Recent advances are classified based on the different assembly mechanisms, i.e., assembly driven by chemical reactions, physical interactions, and the synergy of multiple microscopic interactions. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies with an emphasis on their respective advantages, e.g., structural design flexibility, material compatibility, resolution, or applications are analyzed. In the summary and outlook, existing challenges, as well as possible paths to solutions for future development are reviewed. We believe that with recent advances in assembly&#8208;based nanofabrication strategies, 3D nanofabrication has achieved tremendous progress in resolution, material generality, and manufacturing cost, for it to make a greater impact in the near future.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures: Basic Physics and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the realm of topological spin structures in a variety of magnetic materials. It delves into the fundamental magnetic properties of these spin textures, experimental observations in various materials, and their potential applications, highlighting the significant influence these advancements may have on future technological innovations.








Abstract
In the face of escalating modern data storage demands and the constraints of Moore's Law, exploring spintronic solutions, particularly the devices based on magnetic skyrmions, has emerged as a promising frontier in scientific research. Since the first experimental observation of skyrmions, topological spin textures have been extensively studied for their great potential as efficient information carriers in spintronic devices. However, significant challenges have emerged alongside this progress. This review aims to synthesize recent advances in skyrmion research while addressing the major issues encountered in the field. Additionally, current research on promising topological spin structures in addition to skyrmions is summarized. Beyond 2D structures, exploration also extends to 1D magnetic solitons and 3D spin textures. In addition, a diverse array of emerging magnetic materials is introduced, including antiferromagnets and 2D van der Waals magnets, broadening the scope of potential materials hosting topological spin textures. Through a systematic examination of magnetic principles, topological categorization, and the dynamics of spin textures, a comprehensive overview of experimental and theoretical advances in the research of topological magnetism is provided. Finally, both conventional and unconventional applications are summarized based on spin textures proposed thus far. This review provides an outlook on future development in applied spintronics.

         <title>Swarm Autonomy: From Agent Functionalization to Machine Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Swarm behaviors observed in nature have inspired the development of synthetic swarms. This review covers key aspects of synthetic swarms, including features of individual agents, external stimuli, swarm behaviors, and applications, examines underlying mechanisms of swarm generation and the emergence of machine intelligence, and envisions the realization of swarm autonomy.








Abstract
Swarm behaviors are common in nature, where individual organisms collaborate via perception, communication, and adaptation. Emulating these dynamics, large groups of active agents can self&#8208;organize through localized interactions, giving rise to complex swarm behaviors, which exhibit potential for applications across various domains. This review presents a comprehensive summary and perspective of synthetic swarms, to bridge the gap between the microscale individual agents and potential applications of synthetic swarms. It is begun by examining active agents, the fundamental units of synthetic swarms, to understand the origins of their motility and functionality in the presence of external stimuli. Then inter&#8208;agent communications and agent&#8208;environment communications that contribute to the swarm generation are summarized. Furthermore, the swarm behaviors reported to date and the emergence of machine intelligence within these behaviors are reviewed. Eventually, the applications enabled by distinct synthetic swarms are summarized. By discussing the emergent machine intelligence in swarm behaviors, insights are offered into the design and deployment of autonomous synthetic swarms for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>In Vivo Interactions of Nucleic Acid Nanostructures With Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid nanostructures have been intracellular drug carriers for nanomedicine applications for two decades, but their interaction with cells in vivo has gained clarity only recently. This review features their cellular&#8208;level distribution in various organs and the cellular responses induced in rodents, large animals, and humans. It concludes with directions for probing cell&#8208;nanoparticle interactions and regulatory updates for clinical translation.








Abstract

Nucleic acid nanostructures, derived from the assembly of nucleic acid building blocks (e.g., plasmids and oligonucleotides), are important intracellular carriers of therapeutic cargoes widely utilized in preclinical nanomedicine applications, yet their clinical translation remains scarce. In the era of &#8220;translational nucleic acid nanotechnology&#8221;, a deeper mechanistic understanding of the interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells in vivo will guide the development of more efficacious nanomedicines. This review showcases the recent progress in dissecting the in vivo interactions of four key types of nucleic acid nanostructures (i.e., tile&#8208;based, origami, spherical nucleic acid, and nucleic acid nanogel) with cells in rodents over the past five years. Emphasis lies on the cellular&#8208;level distribution of nucleic acid nanostructures in various organs and tissues and the cellular responses induced by their cellular entry. Next, in the spirit of preclinical translation, this review features the latest interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells in large animals and humans. Finally, the review offers directions for studying the interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells from both materials and biology perspectives and concludes with some regulatory updates.

         <title>Embedded Physical Intelligence in Liquid Crystalline Polymer Actuators and Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal polymers have garnered substantial interest in the pursuit of intelligent robots, thanks to their capacity for reversible shape transformation and the vast potential for manifesting physical intelligence. In this review, a focused summary of the stimulation methodologies employed from various perspectives is provided and discusses current research trends in robotics to imbue physical intelligence into LC polymer systems.








Abstract
Responsive materials possess the inherent capacity to autonomously sense and respond to various external stimuli, demonstrating physical intelligence. Among the diverse array of responsive materials, liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) stand out for their remarkable reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;morphing properties and their potential for creating soft robots. While numerous reviews have extensively detailed the progress in developing LCP&#8208;based actuators and robots, there exists a need for comprehensive summaries that elucidate the underlying principles governing actuation and how physical intelligence is embedded within these systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in developing actuators and robots endowed with physical intelligence using LCPs. This review is structured around the stimulus conditions and categorizes the studies involving responsive LCPs based on the fundamental control and stimulation logic and approach. Specifically, three main categories are examined: systems that respond to changing stimuli, those operating under constant stimuli, and those equip with learning and logic control capabilities. Furthermore, the persisting challenges that need to be addressed are outlined and discuss the future avenues of research in this dynamic field.

Another substantial concern pertains to overheating issues that occur during prolonged operation. Therefore, the design of multifunctional soft electronics exhibiting excellent capabilities in sensing, EMI shielding, and thermal management is of paramount importance. Because of the prominent advantages in chemical stability, electrical and thermal conductivity, and easy functionalization, new carbon materials including carbon nanotubes, graphene and its derivatives, graphdiyne, and sustainable natural&#8208;biomass&#8208;derived carbon are particularly promising candidates for multifunctional soft electronics. This review summarizes the latest advancements in multifunctional soft electronics based on new carbon materials across a range of performance aspects, mainly focusing on the structure or composite design, and fabrication method on the physical signals monitoring, EMI shielding, and thermal management. Furthermore, the device integration strategies and corresponding intriguing applications are highlighted.

         <title>Photonics for Neuromorphic Computing: Fundamentals, Devices, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines advancements in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, focusing on materials and device engineering breakthroughs needed to advance the field. We analyze various technologies in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, evaluating energy efficiency and compute density. Highlighting components like PCSEL lasers and optical interconnects, we discuss recent breakthroughs and recognize obstacles to achieving peta&#8208;level performance. Potential innovations in devices, materials, and integration are explored to overcome these challenges and transform AI and scientific computing in the near future.









Abstract
In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. As the Moore's Law approaches its terminus, there is an urgent need for alternative computing paradigms that satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the barrier of the von Neumann model. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. This review studies the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms that has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub&#8208;nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. In particular, various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PCSEL lasers are examined. Lastly, it is recognized that existing neuromorphic technologies encounter obstacles in meeting the peta&#8208;level computing speed and energy efficiency threshold, and potential approaches in new devices, fabrication, materials, and integration to drive innovation are also explored. As the current challenges and barriers in cost, scalability, footprint, and computing capacity are resolved one&#8208;by&#8208;one, photonic neuromorphic systems are bound to co&#8208;exist with, if not replace, conventional electronic computers and transform the landscape of AI and scientific computing in the foreseeable&#160;future.

         <title>Bioactive Glass in Tissue Regeneration: Unveiling Recent Advances in Regenerative Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, various regenerative strategies based on bioactive glass (BG) (e.g. application of BG dissolution products, surface functionalization of BG, loading of biochemical factor/gene in BG particles/nanoparticles, composite polymer&#8208;BG scaffold, and BG&#8208;induced production of extracellular vesicles) targeting different tissues/organs (e.g. muscle, cartilage, skin, oral tissue, gastrointestinal tissue) are introduced.








Abstract
Bioactive glass (BG) is a class of biocompatible, biodegradable, multifunctional inorganic glass materials, which is successfully used for orthopedic and dental applications, with several products already approved for clinical use. Apart from exhibiting osteogenic properties, BG is also known to be angiogenic and antibacterial. Recently, BG's role in immunomodulation has been gradually revealed. While the therapeutic effect of BG is mostly reported in the context of bone and skin&#8208;related regeneration, its application in regenerating other tissues/organs, such as muscle, cartilage, and gastrointestinal tissue, has also been explored recently. The strategies of applying BG have also expanded from powder or cement form to more advanced strategies such as fabrication of composite polymer&#8208;BG scaffold, 3D printing of BG&#8208;loaded scaffold, and BG&#8208;induced extracellular vesicle production. This review presents a concise overview of the recent applications of BG in regenerative medicine. Various regenerative strategies of BG will be first introduced. Next, the applications of BG in regenerating various tissues/organs, such as bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, skin, and gastrointestinal tissue, will be discussed. Finally, clinical applications of BG for tissue regeneration will be summarized, and future challenges and directions for the clinical translation of BG will be outlined.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Materials in Droplet Manipulation for Biochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation strategies, featured in contactless interaction, high&#8208;spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility, are considered promising, particularly for biochemical applications. Special attention is paid to the underlying mechanisms, recent advancements of light&#8208;responsive materials, and the most notable applications of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation in this review.








Abstract
Miniaturized droplets, characterized by well&#8208;controlled microenvironments and capability for parallel processing, have significantly advanced the studies on enzymatic evolution, molecular diagnostics, and single&#8208;cell analysis. However, manipulation of small&#8208;sized droplets, including moving, merging, and trapping of the targeted droplets for complex biochemical assays and subsequent analysis, is not trivial and remains technically demanding. Among various techniques, light&#8208;driven methods stand out as a promising candidate for droplet manipulation in a facile and flexible manner, given the features of contactless interaction, high spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility. This review therefore compiles an in&#8208;depth discussion of the governing mechanisms underpinning light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation. Besides, light&#8208;responsive materials, representing the core of light&#8211;matter interaction and the key character converting light into different forms of energy, are particularly assessed in this review. Recent advancements in light&#8208;responsive materials and the most notable applications are comprehensively archived and evaluated. Continuous innovations and rational engineering of light&#8208;responsive materials are expected to propel the development of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation, equip droplets with enhanced functionality, and broaden the applications of droplets for biochemical studies and routine biochemical investigations.

Abstract
The quantity of sensor nodes within current computing systems is rapidly increasing in tandem with the sensing data. The presence of a bottleneck in data transmission between the sensors, computing, and memory units obstructs the system's efficiency and speed. To minimize the latency of data transmission between units, novel in&#8208;memory and in&#8208;sensor computing architectures are proposed as alternatives to the conventional von Neumann architecture, aiming for data&#8208;intensive sensing and computing applications. The integration of 2D materials and 2D ferroelectric materials has been expected to build these novel sensing and computing architectures due to the dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, ultra&#8208;fast polarization flipping, and ultra&#8208;low power consumption of the 2D ferroelectrics. Here, the recent progress of 2D ferroelectric devices for in&#8208;sensing and in&#8208;memory neuromorphic computing is reviewed. Experimental and theoretical progresses on 2D ferroelectric devices, including passive ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices and active ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices, are reviewed followed by the integration of perception, memory, and computing application. Notably, 2D ferroelectric devices have been used to simulate synaptic weights, neuronal model functions, and neural networks for image processing. As an emerging device configuration, 2D ferroelectric devices have the potential to expand into the sensor&#8208;memory and computing integration application field, leading to new possibilities for modern electronics.

         <title>Musculoskeletal Organs&#8208;on&#8208;Chips: An Emerging Platform for Studying the Nanotechnology&#8211;Biology Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in musculoskeletal organs&#8208;on&#8208;chips (OoCs) and discusses the integration of nanotechnology in musculoskeletal OoCs for precise control of the nanoscale environment and facilitated functional evaluation. The role of musculoskeletal OoCs&#160;in improving the precision, safety, and efficacy of nanomedicine is then addressed. Finally, the challenges and potential of nanotechnology in OoCs&#160;are envisioned. 








Abstract
Nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches are promising for the treatment of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, which present significant clinical burdens and challenges, but their clinical translation requires a deep understanding of the complex interplay between nanotechnology and MSK biology. Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OoC) systems have emerged as an innovative and versatile microphysiological platform to replicate the dynamics of tissue microenvironment for studying nanotechnology&#8211;biology interactions. This review first covers recent advances and applications of MSK OoCs and their ability to mimic the biophysical and biochemical stimuli encountered by MSK tissues. Next, by integrating nanotechnology into MSK OoCs, cellular responses and tissue behaviors may be investigated by precisely controlling and manipulating the nanoscale environment. Analysis of MSK disease mechanisms, particularly bone, joint, and muscle tissue degeneration, and drug screening and development of personalized medicine may be greatly facilitated using MSK OoCs. Finally, future challenges and directions are outlined for the field, including advanced sensing technologies, integration of immune&#8208;active components, and enhancement of biomimetic functionality. By highlighting the emerging applications of MSK OoCs, this review aims to advance the understanding of the intricate nanotechnology&#8211;MSK biology interface and its significance in MSK disease management, and the development of innovative and personalized therapeutic and interventional strategies.

         <title>Photothermal CO2 Catalysis toward the Synthesis of Solar Fuel: From Material and Reactor Engineering to Techno&#8208;Economic Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent progress in photothermal CO2 conversion, focusing on catalyst design, mechanism analysis, reactor engineering, and techno&#8208;economic aspects. It emphasizes the need to address rising atmospheric CO2 levels by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable solar energy, offering insights and future research directions in managing the anthropogenic carbon cycle.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2), a member of greenhouse gases, contributes significantly to maintaining a tolerable environment for all living species. However, with the development of modern society and the utilization of fossil fuels, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased to 400&#160;ppm, resulting in a serious greenhouse effect. Thus, converting CO2 into valuable chemicals is highly desired, especially with renewable solar energy, which shows great potential with the manner of photothermal catalysis. In this review, recent advancements in photothermal CO2 conversion are discussed, including the design of catalysts, analysis of mechanisms, engineering of reactors, and the corresponding techno&#8208;economic analysis. A guideline for future investigation and the anthropogenic carbon cycle are provided.

         <title>Emerging&#8239;Strategies for the Synthesis of Correlated Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the research status and synthetic challenges in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are showcased. Existing strategies, such as the regulation of nucleation kinetics, nanoscale confinement, defect&#8208;assisted metal trapping, precise control via ligand chemistry, and stepwise deposition, are highlighted. A complementary perspective on emerging methods is provided for high throughput screening and upscaling toward the next&#8208;stage catalyst production.








Abstract
People have been looking for an energy&#8208;efficient and sustainable method to produce future chemicals for decades. Heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with atomic dispersion of robust, well&#8208;characterized active centers are highly desirable. In particular, correlated SACs with cooperative interaction between adjacent single atoms allow the switching of the single&#8208;site pathway to the dual or multisite pathway, thus promoting bimolecular or more complex reactions for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Herein, the structural uniqueness of correlated SACs, including the intermetal distance and electronic interaction in homo/heteronuclear metal sites is featured. Recent advances in the production methods of correlated SACs, showcasing the research status and challenges in traditional methods (such as pyrolysis, wet impregnation, and confined synthesis) for building a comprehensive multimetallic SAC library, are summarized. Emerging strategies such as process automation and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis are highlighted, minimizing the inconsistency in laboratory batch production and allowing high throughput screening and upscaling toward the next&#8208;stage chemical production by correlated SACs.

Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable energy provides a promising route to CO2 conversion and utilization. However, the widely used neutral/alkaline electrolyte consumes a large amount of CO2 to produce (bi)carbonate byproducts, leading to significant challenges at the device level, thereby impeding the further deployment of this reaction. Conducting CO2RR in acidic electrolytes offers a promising solution to address the &#8220;carbonate issue&#8221;; however, it presents inherent difficulties due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, necessitating concerted efforts toward advanced catalyst and electrode designs to achieve high selectivity and activity. This review encompasses recent developments of acidic CO2RR, from mechanism elucidation to catalyst design and device engineering. This review begins by discussing the mechanistic understanding of the reaction pathway, laying the foundation for catalyst design in acidic CO2RR. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth analysis of recent advancements in acidic CO2RR catalysts is provided, highlighting heterogeneous catalysts, surface immobilized molecular catalysts, and catalyst surface enhancement. Furthermore, the progress made in device&#8208;level applications is summarized, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance acidic CO2RR systems. Finally, the existing challenges and future directions in the design of acidic CO2RR catalysts are outlined, emphasizing the need for improved selectivity, activity, stability, and scalability.

         <title>Achieving Environmentally&#8208;Adaptive and Multifunctional Hydrodynamic Metamaterials through Active Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active&#8208;mode hydrodynamic metamaterial is developed with flow&#8208;dipoles, enabling active control of the flow field with various functionalities. By adjusting the flow&#8208;dipole moment, invisibility, flow shielding, and flow enhancing are achieved. Furthermore, it is environmentally adaptive and maintains proper functions in different environments. Thus, this design can significantly enhance tunability and adaptability of hydrodynamic metamaterials in complex and ever&#8208;changing environments. 








Abstract
As hydrodynamic metamaterials continue to develop, the inherent limitations of passive&#8208;mode metamaterials become increasingly apparent. First, passive devices are typically designed for specific environments and lack the adaptability to environmental changes. Second, their unique functions often rely on intricate structures, or challenging material properties, or a combination of both. These limitations considerably hinder the potential applications of hydrodynamic metamaterials. In this study, an active&#8208;mode hydrodynamic metamaterial is theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated by incorporating source&#8208;and&#8208;sink flow&#8208;dipoles into the system, enabling active manipulation of the flow field with various functionalities. By adjusting the magnitude and direction of the flow&#8208;dipole moment, this device can easily achieve invisibility, flow shielding, and flow enhancing. Furthermore, it is environmentally adaptive and can maintain proper functions in different environments. It is anticipated that this design will significantly enhance tunability and adaptability of hydrodynamic metamaterials in complex and ever&#8208;changing&#160;environments.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Approaches to Engineer Fluorescent Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Optimizing surface chemistry and photophysics of these sensors is essential, but current methods limit throughput. This article discusses bottlenecks and highlights opportunities and requirements for high throughput and the scalability of non&#8208;classical recognition strategies.








Abstract
Optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Because of their optoelectronic properties, nanomaterials are often used as building blocks. To transduce the chemical interaction with the analyte into an optical signal, the interplay between surface chemistry and nanomaterial photophysics has to be optimized. Understanding these aspects promises major opportunities for tailored sensors with optimal performance. However, this requires methods to create and explore the many chemical permutations. Indeed, many current approaches are limited in throughput. This affects the chemical design space that can be studied, the application of machine learning approaches as well as fundamental mechanistic understanding. Here, an overview of selection&#8208;limited and synthesis&#8208;limited approaches is provided to create and identify molecular nanosensors. Bottlenecks are discussed and opportunities of non&#8208;classical recognition strategies are highlighted such as corona phase molecular recognition as well as the requirements for high throughput and scalability. Fluorescent carbon nanotubes are powerful building blocks for sensors and their huge chemical design space makes them an ideal platform for high throughput approaches. Therefore, they are the focus of this article, but the insights are transferable to any nanosensor system. Overall, this perspective aims to provide a fresh perspective to overcome current challenges in the nanosensor field.

         <title>RAFT Polymerization for Advanced Morphological Control: From Individual Polymer Chains to Bulk Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is a transformative technique in polymer science, offering unprecedented control over polymer morphology across a vast range of length scales. Recent advances leverage RAFT's precision and versatility to enable advanced materials design by dictating monomer sequences at the molecular level, manipulating self&#8208;assembly to make mesoscale structures, and controlling micro&#8208;phase separation for intricate 3D printed structures.








Abstract
Control of the morphology of polymer systems is achieved through reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques such as Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT). Advanced RAFT techniques offer much more than just &#8220;living&#8221; polymerization &#8212; the RAFT toolkit now enables morphological control of polymer systems across many decades of length&#8208;scale. Morphological control is explored at the molecular&#8208;level in the context of syntheses where individual monomer unit insertion provides sequence&#8208;defined polymers (single unit monomer insertion, SUMI). By being able to define polymer architectures, the synthesis of bespoke shapes and sizes of nanostructures becomes possible by leveraging self&#8208;assembly (polymerization induced self&#8208;assembly, PISA). Finally, it is seen that macroscopic materials can be produced with nanoscale detail, based on phase&#8208;separated nanostructures (polymerization induced microphase separation, PIMS) and microscale detail based on 3D&#8208;printing technologies. RAFT control of morphology is seen to cross from molecular level to additive manufacturing length&#8208;scales, with complete morphological control over all length&#8208;scales.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Pixel Event Photoactive Device for Real&#8208;Time, In&#8208;Sensor Spatiotemporal Optical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device with selective carrier integration that merges spatiotemporal event sensing and built&#8208;in short&#8208;term memory. It processes multibit parallel data and recognizes patterns ultrafast (0.4&#160;&#181;s) with ultralow energy use (25 femtojoules). Adjusting its speed allows trajectory and position detection of events through optical flow sensing.








Abstract
The increasing demand for energy&#8208;efficient, sophisticated optical sensing technologies in various applications, from machine vision to optical communication, highlights the necessity for innovations in spatiotemporal information sensing and processing at a nearly single&#8208;pixel scale. Traditional methods, including multi&#8208;pixel photodetector arrays and event&#8208;based camera systems, often fail to provide rapid, real&#8208;time detection and processing of dynamic events within the sensor. This shortcoming is particularly notable in handling high&#8208;dimensional spatiotemporal data, where the dependency on sequential data input and external processing tools leads to latency, reduced throughput, and heightened energy consumption, thereby impeding real&#8208;time parallel data processing capabilities. Here, a carrier&#8208;selective, single&#8208;pixel, position&#8208;sensitive planar photoactive device that integrates spatiotemporal event sensing with inherent short&#8208;term memory capabilities is introduced. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device enables in&#8208;sensor spatiotemporal parallel optical information processing, efficiently managing multibit (&gt;4 bit) data simultaneously and facilitating ultrafast (&#8776;0.4&#160;&#181;s) recognition of input patterns with low energy consumption (25 femtojoules). Additionally, by adjusting the operating speed from continuous to pulsed light illumination, the sensor array can detect trajectories and absolute position of events, offering in&#8208;sensor optical flow detection. This single&#8208;pixel event photodetector marks significant advancement toward developing compact, energy&#8208;efficient, ultrafast sensors suitable for a wide range of in sensor&#8208;based photonic applications.

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Wetting Transition through the Concave Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the pulvilli of the leaf beetle (Gastrophysa atrocyanea), a new design strategy is introduced to enhance the wetting stability of superhydrophobic surfaces through the implementation of concave structures. The air caps forming on the concavity contribute to preventing the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition under continuous exposure to various impacts and hydrostatic pressures.








Abstract
Water&#8208;repellent superhydrophobic surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. The fundamental understanding of bio/bio&#8208;inspired structures facilitates practical applications surmounting metastable superhydrophobicity. Typically, the hierarchical structure and/or reentrant morphology have been employed hitherto to suppress the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition (CWT). Herein, a new design concept is reported, an effect of concave structure, which is vital for the stable superhydrophobic surface. The thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the concave pillars are evaluated by continuous exposure to various hydrostatic pressures and sudden impacts of water droplets with various Weber numbers (We), comparing them to the standard superhydrophobic normal pillars. Specifically, the concave pillar exhibits reinforced impact resistance preventing CWT below a critical We of &#8776;27.6, which is &#8776;1.6 times higher than that of the normal pillar (&#8776;17.0). Subsequently, the stability of underwater air film (plastron) is investigated at various hydrostatic pressures. The results show that convex air caps formed at the concave cavities generate downward Laplace pressure opposing the exerted hydrostatic pressure between the pillars, thus impeding the hydrostatic pressure&#8208;dependent underwater air diffusion. Hence, the effects of trapped air caps contributing to the stable Cassie&#8208;Baxter state can offer a pioneering strategy for the exploration and utilization of superhydrophobic surfaces.

         <title>Anisotropic Ferroelectricity in Polar Vortices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the existence and anisotropic nature of macroscopic polarization components that emerge within lattices of nanoscale polar vortices are demonstrated. In particular, the component parallel to the vortex axis shows novel switching behavior that can be harnessed for multistate memory, with excellent stability of numerous intermediate states demonstrated.








Abstract
The exotic polarization configurations of topologically protected dipolar textures have opened new avenues for realizing novel phenomena absent in traditional ferroelectric systems. While multiple recent studies have revealed a diverse array of emergent properties in such polar topologies, the details of their atomic and mesoscale structures remain incomplete. Through atomic&#8208; and meso&#8208;scale imaging techniques, the emergence of a macroscopic ferroelectric polarization along both principal axes of the vortex lattice while performing phase&#8208;field modeling to probe the atomic scale origins of these distinct polarization components is demonstrated. Additionally, due to the anisotropic epitaxial strain, the polarization switching behavior perpendicular and parallel to the vortices is highly anisotropic, with switching along the vortex axes occurring over numerous decades in field&#8208;pulse width. This slow switching process allows for the deterministic control of the polarization state, enabling a non&#8208;volatile, multi&#8208;state memory with excellent distinguishability and long retention&#160;times.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Rapid Elimination of Antibiotic Resistance Contaminations Using Graphitic Carbon Nitride Tailored with Carrier Confinement Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carrier confinement domains alter the inherent sp2 hybridized plane structure of graphitic carbon nitride, further inducing stronger electron delocalization and long&#8208;range order, which promotes faster separation and migration of photogenerated carrier, accelerates redox reaction decoupling and photodynamic antibiotic resistance removal.








Abstract
Solar water disinfection facilitated by photocatalyst has been considered a viable point&#8208;of&#8208;use (POU) method for mitigating antibiotic resistance contaminations at the household or community levels. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to guide the fabrication of a carrier confinement domains (CCD)&#8208;decorated graphitic carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst. The CCD integration effectively disrupts the electron distribution symmetry of CN, amplifies its local electron density, and facilitates the formation of a long&#8208;range ordered structure, thereby enhancing charge separation efficiency. Importantly, the CCD directs the migration of photogenerated carriers to specific regions upon light illumination, effectively minimizing their spatial proximity. As a result, the overall reactive oxygen species level of the photocatalytic system is markedly elevated, with a twelvefold increase in H2O2 concentration, alongside a significant rise in &#8226;O2&#8722; and &#8226;OH steady&#8208;state concentrations. Remarkably, a record&#8208;high disinfection efficiency is attained, successfully inactivating 7 log of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria within 30&#160;min. Additionally, the photocatalyst can be integrated into a continuous&#8208;flow fixed&#8208;bed reactor, facilitating clean water production for up to 60&#160;h at a rate of 121&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;day&#8722;1, highlighting its significant potential for POU applications.

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limit for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Inhibited and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass transport limit is circumvented by the pulsed charging protocols, achieving (002)&#8208;textured, dendrite&#8208;free, and hydrogen&#8208;evolution&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping at ultrahigh current density up to 160 mA cm&#8722;2. The Zn batteries accordingly achieve high current density (50&#8211;100 mA cm&#8722;2), high areal mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2), and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
It is commonly accepted that batteries perform better at low current densities below the mass&#8208;transport limit, which restricts their current rate and capacity. Here, it is demonstrated that the performance of Zn metal electrodes can be dramatically enhanced at current densities and cut&#8208;off capacities exceeding the mass&#8208;transport limit by using pulsed&#8208;current protocols. These protocols achieve cumulative plating/stripping capacities of 11.0 Ah cm&#8722;2 and 3.8 Ah cm&#8722;2 at record&#8208;high current densities of 80 and 160 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The study identifies and understands the promoted (002)&#8208;textured Zn growth and suppressed hydrogen evolution based on the thermodynamics and kinetics of competing reactions. Furthermore, the over&#8208;limiting pulsed&#8208;current protocol enables long&#8208;life Zn batteries with high mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2) and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2), outperforming cells using constant&#8208;current protocols at equivalent energy and time costs. The work provides a comprehensive understanding of the current&#8208;capacity&#8208;performance relationship in Zn plating/stripping and offers an effective strategy for dendrite&#8208;free metal batteries that meet practical requirements for high capacity and high current rates.

The multifunctional Nb3Se12I photodetector integrated broadband imaging and encrypted communications are realized based on the photothermoelectric effect and polarization sensitivity. The photothermoelectric and photoconductive effect synergistic detection mechanism enable high responsivity and rapid operation across a broad wavelength spectrum from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz. The encrypted method of polarization state compensation for photothermoelectric current converting image data into polarization states enhances information security. This work provides an effective strategy to advance anisotropic thermoelectric materials for high&#8208;capacity, secure communication applications.








Abstract
Securing high&#8208;capacity and safe communication holds great potential for ushering in the new era of digital society. In this study, a wide&#8208;band photodetector based on the quasi&#8208;1D niobium selenide compounds (Nb3Se12I), showing up photothermoelectric (PTE) dominated multiple synergistic effects with high responsivity across a wide wavelength range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet (254&#160;nm) to terahertz (0.30 THz), providing an efficient strategy for high&#8208;capacity optical processing is introduced. Combined with the polarized&#8208;sensitive property of the Nb3Se12I photodetector, an encrypted imaging technology using polarization&#8208;resolved PTE current is developed. This technology is capable of transforming encrypted messages into polarization states, which can be restored through a specially designed decryption algorithm, greatly enhancing the concealment and security of the information transmission process. Overall, the Nb3Se12I&#8208;based detector manifests in terms of high responsivity (283.2 A W&#8722;1 to 520&#160;nm, 1632.4 A W&#8722;1 to 980&#160;nm, and 1868.1 A W&#8722;1 for short&#8208;wave infrared light of 2200&#160;nm), suitable response speed of 43 &#181;s for 0.30 THz wave and polarization anisotropy ratio of 1.83. The versatile abilities of photodetector in the realm of ultrabroadband polarized detection and encryption imaging may advance the use of anisotropic thermoelectric materials in high&#8208;capacity and secure information communication applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene@CuCo2O4 /PE Separator for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Large&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>

This study presents a multifunctional ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene/CuCo2O4/PE separator that can suppress LiPSs shuttling, enhance sulfur redox kinetics, and regulate Li+ deposition, and consequently achieve an outstanding energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 10Ah&#8208;level pouch cell.








Abstract
The shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), sluggish reaction kinetics, and uncontrolled lithium deposition/stripping remain the main challenges in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), which are aggravated under practical working conditions, i.e., high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte in large&#8208;capacity pouch cells. This study introduces a Ti3C2Tx MXene@CuCo2O4 (MCC) composite on a polyethylene (PE) separator to construct an ultrathin MXene@CuCo2O4/PE (MCCP) film. The MCCP functional separator can deliver superior LiPSs adsorption/catalysis capabilities via the MCC composite and regulate the Li+ deposition through a conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene framework, enhancing redox kinetics and cycling lifetime. When paired with sulfur/carbon (S/C) cathode and lithium metal anode, the resultant 10 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with the ultrathin MCCP separator achieves an energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the whole cell and a stable running of 100 cycles under practical operation conditions (cathode loading = 10.0&#8201;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, negative/positive areal capacity ratio (N/P ratio) = 2, and electrolyte/sulfur weight ratio (E/S ratio) = 2.6&#8201;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). Furthermore, through a systematic evaluation of the as&#8208;prepared Li&#8208;S pouch cell, the study unveils the operational and failure mechanisms of LSBs under practical conditions. The achievement of ultrahigh energy density in such a large&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;sulfur pouch cell will accelerate the commercialization of LSBs.

         <title>Dirac&#8208;Like Fermions Anomalous Magneto&#8208;Transport in a Spin&#8208;Polarized Oxide 2D Electron System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous magneto&#8208;transport dominated by non&#8208;trivial Berry curvature and Dirac&#8208;like fermions is exhibited by an engineered 2D electron system (2DES) at (111) LaAlO3/EuTiO3/SrTiO3 interface, where structural and electronic properties are tailored to mimic that of magnetic gapped topological insulators.









Abstract
In a 2D electron system (2DES) the breaking of the inversion, time&#8208;reversal and bulk crystal&#8208;field symmetries is interlaced with the effects of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) triggering exotic quantum phenomena. Here, epitaxial engineering is used to design and realize a 2DES characterized simultaneously by ferromagnetic order, large Rashba SOC and hexagonal band warping at the (111) interfaces between LaAlO3, EuTiO3, and SrTiO3 insulators. The 2DES displays anomalous quantum corrections to the magneto&#8208;conductance driven by the time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking occurring below the magnetic transition temperature. The results are explained by the emergence of a non&#8208;trivial Berry phase and competing weak anti&#8208;localization/weak localization back&#8208;scattering of Dirac&#8208;like fermions, mimicking the phenomenology of gapped topological insulators. These findings open perspectives for the engineering of novel spin&#8208;polarized functional 2DES holding promises in spin&#8208;orbitronics and topological&#160;electronics.

         <title>Bidirectional Photovoltage&#8208;Driven Oxide Transistors for Neuromorphic Visual Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor is constructed by connecting the different electrodes of two perovskite solar cells to the two gates of ion&#8208;regulated In2O3 transistors. The mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition.








Abstract
Biological vision is one of the most important parts of the human perception system. However, emulating biological visuals is challenging because it requires complementary photoexcitation and photoinhibition. Here, the study presents a bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor (BPNVS) that is constructed by monolithically integrating two perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with dual&#8208;gate ion&#8208;gel&#8208;gated oxide transistors. PSCs act as photoreceptors, converting external visual stimuli into electrical signals, whereas oxide transistors generate neuromorphic signal outputs that can be adjusted to produce positive and negative photoresponses. This device mimics the human vision system's ability to recognize colored and color&#8208;mixed patterns. The device achieves a static color recognition accuracy of 96% by utilizing the reservoir computing system for feature extraction. The BPNVS mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition. This work is a significant step forward in neuromorphic sensing and complex pattern recognition.

Benefiting from the presence of intrinsic STEs, the photoconductive effects induced by STEs can enhance their applicability in photodetection with remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum performance.








Abstract
Exploring novel materials with intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. In this study, 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4, featuring broken inversion symmetry, is introduced to investigate intrinsic STEs. This material exhibits a broadband photoluminescence (PL) emission with a full width at half maximum of 164&#160;nm and a large Stokes shift of &#8776;0.6&#160;eV, which arises from the distortion of [ZnS4]6&#8208; tetrahedral unit induced by the symmetry breaking and strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The photophysical properties of the STEs exhibit a high Huang&#8208;Rhys factor (15.0), rapid STEs formation time (166&#160;fs), and extended STEs lifetime (1039&#160;ps), as demonstrated by experimental evidence from temperature&#8208;dependent PL, Raman spectroscopy, and ultrafast absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, STE&#8208;induced photoconductive&#160;effect is elucidated, indicating that intrinsic STEs in 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can provide a synergistic effect that enhances absorption capacity, localization, and lifetime by capturing the self&#8208;trapped hole state. Consequently, the 2D 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 photodetector exhibits remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum photosensitivity, including a photo&#8208;switching ratio of 11286, response times of less than 0.6&#160;ms, responsivity of 15.2&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, detectivity of 1.02&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#185;&#185; Jones, and external quantum efficiency of 5032% under 375&#160;nm light. These findings provide new ideas for exploring materials with intrinsic STEs to achieve novel high&#8208;performance photodetector applications.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Tunable Enhancement of Piezoelectricity in a Novel Molecular Multiferroic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first strain engineering in molecular ionic multiferroics. Under a strain of 2.0%, a tenfold increase in piezoelectric performance and a significant reduction of 50% in the ferroelectric coercive field are observed, which unveils a novel strategy to augment the performance of molecular multiferroics.








Abstract
Multiferroics are appealing because of application potentials in data storage devices, sensors, transducers, and energy harvesters. Molecular multiferroics emerge as a promising alternative to inorganic multiferroics due to flexibility, light weight, low toxicity, solution processing, structural diversity, and chemical tunability. While researches have predominantly focused on perovskite structures, studies on molecular ionic multiferroics remain relatively limited. It is urgent to creatively build a novel platform for studying and developing the coupling and interaction between the stress, electricity, and magnetism. Knowing this, the work focuses on a novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid multiferroic N&#8208;ethyl&#8208;N&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylethylammonium tetrabromoferrate (III) showing coexisting magnetic and electric orderings. It undergoes antiferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferroelastic transitions. Notably, under a strain of 2.0%, the piezoelectric response increases tenfold, and the coercive field of ferroelectric polarization is reduced by half. The strain&#8208;induced enhancement of piezoelectricity is rarely reported in molecular multiferroics. Density functional theory is employed to predict that the mechanism of the large piezoelectric response under strain engineering is related to the cation rotation and phase switching between the stable phase and an energetically competitive metastable phase. This study creates a new paradigm to develop molecular multiferroics and future microelectronic devices for energy conversion.

         <title>Evidence of Quasi&#8208;Na Metallic Clusters in Sodium Ion Batteries through In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets&#8208;8 (HDCS&#8208;8) anode uniformly adsorbs Na+ in the high&#8208;voltage slope region, resulting in the formation of small particle hexagonal quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters. Subsequently, the HDCS&#8208;8 anode transforms the small particle hexagonal systems clusters into large particle orthorhombic systems of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in the low&#8208;voltage region.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials have been considered the most promising anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, good electrical conductivity, and structural stability. The main challenge of carbonaceous anodes prior to their commercialization is low initial coulomb efficiencies, derived from a lack of an efficient technique to reveal a fundamental comprehension of sodium storage mechanisms. Here, the direct observation of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in carbonaceous anodes during cycling through in situ XRD is reported. By means of such a technique, a strong self&#8208;adsorption behavior forming quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters is detected within a rationally designed highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets (HDCS) anode. Such a self&#8208;adsorption and crystalline system transformation mechanism in HDCS brings capacity retention about 100% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work provides a new principle for designing high&#8208;performance carbon anodes for SIBs.

         <title>Disrupting Intracellular Homeostasis by Copper&#8208;Based Nanoinducer with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Activities to Induce Disulfidptosis&#8208;Enhanced Pyroptosis for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) aimed to disrupt intracellular metabolism and redox homeostasis for inducing tumor cells disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced immunogenic pyroptosis. The combination of these two cell death modes could promote the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines, reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immune cells infiltration. The evoked robust immune responses helped to suppress tumor progression.








Abstract
Given the crucial role of abnormal homeostasis in tumor cells for maintaining their growth, it may be more efficient with less effort to develop anti&#8208;tumor strategies that target multiple combined mechanisms by disrupting intracellular homeostasis. Here, a copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) with multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities is designed and constructed to induce disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis through disrupting multiple intracellular homeostasis for effective tumor immunotherapy. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), CGBH NNs can disrupt intracellular glucose homeostasis and inhibit NADPH production, leading to accumulation of cystine, which further blocked the substrate and key enzyme for synthesizing glutathione. Subsequently, through cascade catalytic reactions involving enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like, glucose oxidase and peroxidase&#8208;like activities), CGBH NNs can produce massive reactive oxygen species&#160;(ROS) and further disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis, resulting in the disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis. The tumor cells undergoing immunogenic pyroptosis can release various cytosolic contents and inflammatory factors, eliciting robust immune responses by facilitating immune cell infiltration, and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. After the combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, CGBH NNs can effectively suppress the tumor growth and prolong the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a novel paradigm to trigger disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis by destroying intracellular homeostasis for anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Enhanced Photosensitizer Wettability via Anchoring Competition of Violet Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Breakthroughs in Photodynamic Film Sterilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy to enhance the wettability of photosensitizers in photodynamic films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) by anchoring violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs). This approach effectively boosts the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antibacterial efficacy. Computational modeling and experimental findings demonstrate the promising potential of VP/Hy&#8208;BC films for applications in antibacterial packaging.








Abstract
Wettability is important for photodynamic film sterilization since higher wettability enhances the capture of bacteria in contact with photosensitizers. Herein, a small number of violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs) are anchored into hypericin bacterial cellulose films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) to improve wettability, reducing the water contact angle from 56.8&#176; to 33.0&#176;. This modification facilitated more effective interactions between the bacteria and photosensitizers, rapidly inactivating 7 log10 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus within 60&#160;min. First&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that VPQDs, with their low spatial site resistance, reduced the intermolecular Hy self&#8208;aggregation force.

     alt="Enhanced Photosensitizer Wettability via Anchoring Competition of Violet Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Breakthroughs in Photodynamic Film Sterilization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work presents a novel strategy to enhance the wettability of photosensitizers in photodynamic films (VP/Hy-BC films) by anchoring violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs). This approach effectively boosts the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antibacterial efficacy. Computational modeling and experimental findings demonstrate the promising potential of VP/Hy-BC films for applications in antibacterial packaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wettability is important for photodynamic film sterilization since higher wettability enhances the capture of bacteria in contact with photosensitizers. Herein, a small number of violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs) are anchored into hypericin bacterial cellulose films (VP/Hy-BC films) to improve wettability, reducing the water contact angle from 56.8&#176; to 33.0&#176;. This modification facilitated more effective interactions between the bacteria and photosensitizers, rapidly inactivating 7 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; CFU/mL of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; within 60&#160;min. First-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that VPQDs, with their low spatial site resistance, reduced the intermolecular Hy self-aggregation force. This increased the solvent-accessible surface area of VP/Hy by &#8776;25.7%, thereby decreasing hydrophobic photosensitizer aggregation. Consequently, more active sites are exposed, remarkably improving the photoelectron transfer efficiency. VP/Hy-BC demonstrated exceptional efficacy in inhibiting bacterial proliferation; for instance, it extended beef shelf life by up to 10 days. The findings of this study will aid the development of health-conscious, eco-friendly, and efficient antimicrobial packaging films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Carrier Transport in Quasi&#8208;2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;2D/3D heterojunction&#8208;based WBG perovskite is constructed to repair the surface defects and weaken the quantum&#8208;well confinement effect. These advances reduce interfacial carrier transport loss, contributing to balanced carrier recombination in the interconnecting layer. The resulting perovskite/organic tandems exhibit record power conversion efficiencies of 25.92% (0.0628&#160;cm2) and 24.63% (1.004&#160;cm2), as well as robust operational stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites are continuously in the limelight owing to their applicability in tandem solar cells. The main bottlenecks of WBG perovskites are interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination and carrier transport loss caused by interfacial defects and large energy&#8208;level offsets, which induce additional energy losses when WBG perovskites are stacked with organic solar cells in series because of unbalanced carrier recombination in interconnecting layer (ICL). To solve these issues, 1,3&#8208;propanediammonium iodide (PDADI) is incorporated to form Dion&#8211;Jacobson &#8208;phase quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with mixed high&#8208;n&#8208;values in WBG perovskites. PDADI simultaneously repairs the shallow/deep defects and establishes a Type&#8208;II energy&#8208;level alignment between quasi&#8208;2D/3D and 3D perovskites for rapid carrier extraction. More importantly, the short&#8208;chain diammonium cation in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite with high n&#8208;values results in a short Pb&#8211;I inorganic layer spacing, which enhances the interlayer electronic coupling and weakens the quantum&#8208;well confinement effect that restricts carrier transport. The suppressed transport loss increases the electron concentration in the ICL for balanced carrier recombination. The 0.0628 and 1.004 cm2 perovskite/organic tandems achieve remarkable efficiencies of 25.92% and 24.63%, respectively. The quasi&#8208;2D capping layer can inhibit ion migration, allowing perovskite/organic tandems to show excellent operational stability (T85 &gt;&#160;1000&#160;h).

         <title>Substantially Enhanced Spin Polarization in Epitaxial CrTe2 Quantum Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A firm and clear picture of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin texture indeed gives direct evidence of the intrinsic effective spin polarization of CrTe2. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, opens up an exciting opportunity to investigate exotic spin physics in 2D limit.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which extend to the monolayer (ML) limit, are rapidly gaining prominence in logic applications for low&#8208;power electronics. To improve the performance of spintronic devices, such as vdW magnetic tunnel junctions, a large effective spin polarization of valence electrons is highly desired. Despite its considerable significance, direct probe of spin polarization in these 2D magnets has not been extensively explored. Here, using 2D vdW ferromagnet of CrTe2 as a prototype, the spin degrees of freedom in the thin films are directly probed using Mott polarimetry. The electronic band of 50 ML CrTe2 thin film, spanning the Brillouin zone, exhibits pronounced spin&#8208;splitting with polarization peaking at 7.9% along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. Surprisingly, atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, achieving 23.4% polarization even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The demonstrated correlation between spin polarization and film thickness highlights the pivotal influence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, interlayer interactions, and itinerant behavior on these properties, as corroborated by theoretical analysis. This groundbreaking experimental verification of intrinsic effective spin polarization in CrTe2 ultrathin films marks a significant advance in establishing 2D ferromagnetic atomic layers as a promising platform for innovative vdW&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Intratumoral Injectable Redox&#8208;Responsive Immune Niche Improves the Abscopal Effect in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intratumoral injectable nanofiber&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) is engineered with redox&#8208;responsive IL&#8208;2 nanogels (NGs), &#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 NGs, and poly(I:C). The TIN converts X&#8208;ray radiotherapy (XRT)&#8208;treated tumor into in situ cancer vaccine by expanding neoantigen&#8208;specific tumor&#8208;infiltrating lymphocytes at the treated primary tumor site, thereby eliciting robust systemic anticancer activity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (XRT) is often utilized to improve the immune checkpoint blockade response in cancer management. Such combination treatment can enhance the abscopal effect, facilitating a prolonged and durable systemic response. However, despite intense research efforts, only a minority of patients respond to this approach, and novel strategies to increase the abscopal effect are urgently needed. Here, the development of an intratumoral (i.t.) injectable nanofiber (NF)&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) that converts XRT&#8208;treated tumors into an in situ cancer vaccine, eliciting robust systemic antitumor immunity, is reported. This NF&#8208;based immune niche incorporates redox&#8208;degradable anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 (&#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4) nanogels (NGs) and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) NGs for controlled release in hypoxic irradiated tumors, reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into a pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment, and expanding the tumor&#8208;infiltrating CD8+ T cell population. Additionally, it is functionalized with polyinosinic&#8208;polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) to promote antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation and prime neoantigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells. In vitro studies demonstrate TIN's ability to prime antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and increase antigen&#8208;specific cell&#8208;killing efficiency under in vitro immunosuppressive conditions. In vivo studies confirm TIN's ability to elicit robust systemic anticancer activity in mouse melanoma and colorectal cancer models without inducing severe immune&#8208;related adverse events.

         <title>Wearable Haptics for Orthotropic Actuation Based on Perpendicularly Nested Auxetic SMA Knotting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable haptics for orthotropic actuation (WHOA) can be used for teleoperation of drones and robots with directional sensory perception in 3D space. The perpendicularly nested auxetic pattern with parylene coating provide orthotopically decoupled tactile feedback and wearable multimodal haptics.








Abstract
Smart wearable tactile systems, designed to deliver different types of touch feedback on human skin, can significantly improve engagement through diverse actuation patterns in virtual or augmented reality environments. Here, a perpendicularly nested auxetic wearable haptic interface is reported for orthotropically decoupled multimodal actuation (WHOA), capable of producing diverse tactile feedback modes with 3D sensory perception. WHOA incorporates shape memory alloy wires that are intricately knotted into an auxetic structure oriented along orthotropic dual axes. Its perpendicularly nested auxetic structure enables orthotropic actuation, allowing independent expansion and contraction along both x and y&#8208;axes, as confirmed by force&#8208;strain and displacement&#8208;time performance tests. Additionally, the perylene coating provides orthogonal electrical isolation to WHOA, allowing for stripe&#8208;specific localized actuation and enabling multiple tactile feedback modes. As an orthotropic wearable haptic interface, WHOA distinguishes between x&#8208;axis and y&#8208;axis directions and ultimately delivers multi&#8208;dimensional information regarding movements in 3D space through tactile feedback.

     alt="Wearable Haptics for Orthotropic Actuation Based on Perpendicularly Nested Auxetic SMA Knotting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearable haptics for orthotropic actuation (WHOA) can be used for teleoperation of drones and robots with directional sensory perception in 3D space. The perpendicularly nested auxetic pattern with parylene coating provide orthotopically decoupled tactile feedback and wearable multimodal haptics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart wearable tactile systems, designed to deliver different types of touch feedback on human skin, can significantly improve engagement through diverse actuation patterns in virtual or augmented reality environments. Here, a perpendicularly nested auxetic wearable haptic interface is reported for orthotropically decoupled multimodal actuation (WHOA), capable of producing diverse tactile feedback modes with 3D sensory perception. WHOA incorporates shape memory alloy wires that are intricately knotted into an auxetic structure oriented along orthotropic dual axes. Its perpendicularly nested auxetic structure enables orthotropic actuation, allowing independent expansion and contraction along both &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y-&lt;/i&gt;axes, as confirmed by force-strain and displacement-time performance tests. Additionally, the perylene coating provides orthogonal electrical isolation to WHOA, allowing for stripe-specific localized actuation and enabling multiple tactile feedback modes. As an orthotropic wearable haptic interface, WHOA distinguishes between &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-axis and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;-axis directions and ultimately delivers multi-dimensional information regarding movements in 3D space through tactile feedback. As a result, when worn on the foot or arm, WHOA naturally delivers spatiotemporal tactile information to the user, facilitating navigation and teleoperation with 3D sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Structural Hydrogels Reinforced by Gradient Twisted Plywood Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural design of natural structural hydrogels in crustacean exoskeletons, this work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels with gradient twisted plywood structure. The structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength, modulus, and toughness, coupled with recorded high fatigue threshold, superior impact resistance, and programmable shape morphing capability.








Abstract
Naturally structural hydrogels such as crustacean exoskeletons possess a remarkable combination of seemingly contradictory properties: high strength, modulus, and toughness coupled with exceptional fatigue resistance, owing to their hierarchical structures across multiple length scales. However, replicating these unique mechanical properties in synthetic hydrogels remains a significant challenge. This work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels by employing cholesteric liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly followed by nanocrystalline engineering. The resulting hydrogels exhibit a long&#8208;range ordered gradient twisted plywood structure with high crystallinity to mimic the design of crustacean exoskeletons. Consequently, the structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength (46&#160;&#177;&#160;3&#160;MPa), modulus (496&#160;&#177;&#160;25&#160;MPa), and toughness (170&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), together with recorded high fatigue threshold (32.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) and superior impact resistance (48&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;kJ m&#8722;1). Additionally, through controlling geometry and compositional gradients of the hierarchical structures, a programmable shape morphing process allows for the fabrication of complex 3D hydrogels. This study not only offers valuable insights into advanced design strategies applicable to a broad range of promising hierarchical materials, but also pave the ways for load&#8208;bearing applications in tissue engineering, wearable devices, and soft robotics.

This study introduces a novel single&#8208;step proximity vapor transfer technique to develop large, transparent neuromorphic devices using van der Waals materials. The device exhibits biological synapse&#8208;like behavior, supporting logic gate operations, neurotransmission, and imaging.

Abstract
Neuromorphic computing, which involves the creation of artificial synapses capable of mimicking biological brain activity, has intrigued researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). To advance neuromorphic computing, a highly efficient 2D material&#8208;based artificial synapse capable of performing logical and arithmetic operations must be developed. However, fabricating large, uniform films or high&#8208;quality structures of 2D materials remains challenging because of their multistep and complex fabrication processes. In the present study, to produce large (&#216; &#8776; 3 in.), uniform, transparent neuromorphic devices, a novel single&#8208;step approach called proximity vapor transfer (PVT) that utilizes van der Waals (vdW) materials is employed. This single&#8208;step technique, which involves the fabrication of vdW materials on various substrates (glass, ITO, AZO, Mo, and Cu), allows control of the thickness and bandgap tunability. The Schottky device developed via the PVT method using vdW SnS with neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)&#8208;like functionality emulates biological synapses and exhibits photoelectronic synaptic behavior with wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view synaptic plasticity. In addition, logic gate operations (NOT, OR, AND), reward&#8208;cascade neurotransmission, and imaging can be performed using 3 &#215; 3 arrays of the device. This study represents a significant step toward the development of transparent and large&#8208;area synaptic devices, which are crucial for advancing AI applications.

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Chaperoned Deep&#8208;NIR Triarylmethane Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast In Vivo Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;phototherapy necessitates bright, stable, biocompatible fluorophores absorbing/emitting beyond 800 nm. Molecular engineering guidelines are established that brightness may be improved via rigidification, stability via steric shielding, and biocompatibility via the installation of multiple water&#8208;soluble groups. Nevertheless, the resulting fluorochromic scaffold is expected to be synthetically challenging. BSA&#8208;chaperoning of a structurally flexible deep NIR&#8208;absorbing dye is a feasible solution to the problem.








Abstract
Fluorophores absorbing/emitting in the deep near&#8208;infrared (deep NIR) spectral region, that is, 800 nm and beyond, hold great promise for in vivo bioimaging, diagnosis, and phototherapy due to deeper tissue penetration. The bottleneck is the lack of bright, stable, and readily synthesized deep NIR fluorophores. Here, it is reported that the albumin&#8208;chaperon strategy is a viable one&#8208;for&#8208;all strategy to address these difficulties. A focused library of deep&#8208;NIR absorbing dyes (EA5) is easily synthesized via a two&#8208;step cascade. They are neither very stable nor bright in phosphate buffer&#160;due to a propeller&#8208;type flexible scaffold. Through screening, EA5_c3 is found to exhibit a high affinity toward bovine serum albumin (BSA). Binding&#8208;associated structural rigidification resulted in a gigantic 26&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement. The albumin chaperone also greatly improved the stability of EA5_c3 by shielding the bisbenzannulated triarylmethane core from nucleophilic or oxidative species. The resulting EA5_c3@BSA exhibits high biocompatibility. It offered high&#8208;resolution vasculature, lymph systems, tumors, and other tissue imaging with its bright deep NIR emission. At the same time, it exhibits prominent potential in photoacoustic imaging and photothermal treatment of subcutaneous and orthotopic breast tumors. These findings provide insights into robust and high&#8208;performance fluorophores with deep NIR regions for theranostic against aggressive cancers.

         <title>Boosting the Structural and Electrochemical Stability of Chloride&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Perovskite Solid Electrolytes by Alkali Ion Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali ion doping is proposed to endow the CsSnCl3 solid electrolyte with a robust cubic structure against broad temperature variations at 213&#8722;473 K or a high relative humidity of 90%. Mild annealing further modifies the microstructure, resulting in a two fold increase in chloride ion conductivity and impressive electrochemical stability in various solid&#8208;state chloride ion batteries.








Abstract
The use of chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes derived from Lewis acid&#8210;base reactions enables the construction of various new rechargeable batteries, such as chloride ion batteries (CIBs). However, a critical problem with these electrolytes is their poor stability under low&#8208;temperature, moist, or electrochemical conditions, which can lead to deterioration of the phase structure and a loss of ion conduction. Herein, the robust cubic structure of tin&#8208;based perovskite chloride&#8212;a chloride ion conductor&#8212;is achieved by alkali ion doping at the tin site via direct mechanical milling. The as&#8208;prepared cubic CsSn0.925Na0.075Cl2.925 (CSNC) electrolyte exhibits outstanding structural stability over a broad temperature range of 213&#8722;473 K or under a high relative humidity of up to 90%, at which the typical chloride electrolytes previously reported deteriorate because of moisture. Importantly, mild annealing can modify the microstructure of the CSNC, resulting in a two fold increase in ionic conductivity and an increase in electrochemical stability, which is superior to those of other chloride electrolytes reported in previous studies. The effective chloride&#8208;ion transfer and wide electrochemical window of the CSNC are further demonstrated in different solid&#8208;state CIBs.

The as-prepared cubic CsSn&lt;sub&gt;0.925&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.075&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2.925&lt;/sub&gt; (CSNC) electrolyte exhibits outstanding structural stability over a broad temperature range of 213&#8722;473 K or under a high relative humidity of up to 90%, at which the typical chloride electrolytes previously reported deteriorate because of moisture. Importantly, mild annealing can modify the microstructure of the CSNC, resulting in a two fold increase in ionic conductivity and an increase in electrochemical stability, which is superior to those of other chloride electrolytes reported in previous studies. The effective chloride-ion transfer and wide electrochemical window of the CSNC are further demonstrated in different solid-state CIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Cathode for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neoteric strategy is put forward using a redox&#8208;bipolar covalent organic framework cathode constructed from aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units to explore the ion co&#8208;storage characteristics in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. With this delicate structure and special storage mode, the resultant cathode shows impressive electrochemical properties at a wide temperature range, and all&#8208;organic sodium ion batteries also showcase the possibility of practical applications.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the construction of redox&#8208;bipolar COFs with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage feature for SIBs is rarely reported. Herein, redox&#8208;bipolar COF constructed from aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#160;is developed as the cathode material in SIBs for the first time. The unique integration of conductive aniline skeletons and quinone redox centers endows TPAD&#8208;COF with high ionic/electrical conductivity, abundant redox&#8208;active sites, and fascinating bipolar features. Consequently, the elaborately tailored TPAD&#8208;COF cathode exhibits higher specific capacity (186.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance (over 2000 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with 0.015% decay rate per cycle). Impressively, TPAD&#8208;COF also displays a high specific capacity of 101&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, all&#8208;organic SIBs (AOSIBs) are assembled using TPAD&#8208;COF cathode and disodium terephthalate anode, which also show impressive electrochemical properties, indicating the potential application of TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in AOSIBs. The work will pave the avenue toward advanced COFs cathode for rechargeable batteries through rational molecular design.

         <title>Regulating the Local Spin States in Spinel Oxides to Promote the Activity of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study regulates the local spin states by incorporating Ni into Co3O4 and explores their impact on activity in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. High spin Ni ions facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the unoccupied orbitals of CO2, providing sufficient active sites for the nucleation and growth of small Li2CO3 crystals, thereby improving reversibility.








Abstract
Due to the high energy barrier, slow reaction kinetics, and complex reaction environments of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, the development of durable and efficient catalysts is essential. Transition metal oxides are promising for their availability, stability, and 3d electronic features, with spin states playing an important role in CO2 activation. In this study, the local spin states are regulated by incorporating Ni into Co3O4 and its impact on activity in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries is explored. The results show that Ni atoms with high spin states in Ni0.1Co2.9O4 facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the unoccupied orbitals of CO2, providing sufficient active sites for the nucleation and growth of small Li2CO3 crystals. These small crystals have a low decomposition barrier, leading to improved battery efficiency. Therefore, Ni0.1Co2.9O4 shows superior catalytic performance with an overpotential of 0.72&#160;V and an energy efficiency of &#8776;70% after 500&#160;h. This work provides insights into the relationship between spin states and CO2 reactions, highlighting a promising avenue for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Observation of Highly Spin&#8208;Polarized Dangling Bond Surface States in Rare&#8208;Earth Pnictide Tellurides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique type of surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting is realized. Spin ARPES measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, arising from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. This work presents an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, shedding lights on potential spintronic applications.








Abstract
To generate and manipulate spin&#8208;polarized electronic states in solids are crucial for modern spintronics. The textbook routes employ quantum well states or Shockley/topological type surface states whose spin degeneracy is lifted by strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking at the surface/interface. The resultant spin polarization is usually truncated because of the intertwining between multiple orbitals. Here a unique type of surface states is realized, namely, dangling bond surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides RePnTe (Re = La, Gd, Ce; Pn = Sb, Bi), with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting. Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, which, according to the theoretical analysis, arise from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. The work extends the so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden spin polarization&#8221; from the bulk to the surface, presenting an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, which may shed lights on potential spintronic applications.

         <title>Vacancies Engineering in Molybdenum Boride MBene Nanosheets to Activate Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental realization of 2D Mo&#8208;vacancy molybdenum boride (Mo4/3B2) MBene nanosheets is demonstrated with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic character by selectively etching bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K.








Abstract
The rapid development of low energy dissipation spintronic devices has stimulated the search for air&#8208;stable 2D nanomaterials possessing room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. Here the experimental realization of 2D Mo4/3B2 nanosheets is reported with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic characteristics by vacancy engineering. These nanosheets are synthesized by etching the bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 into Mo4/3B2 nanosheets in ZnCl2 molten salt. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties, with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, while vacancy&#8208;free MoB MBene exhibits paramagnetism. It is elucidated that the Mo&#8208;vacancy defect generates large density of states near the Fermi surface and spontaneously spin&#8208;split bands through first&#8208;principles calculations, which contributes to the non&#8208;zero magnetic moment in Mo4/3B2 nanosheets. This work lays the groundwork for activating the magnetic properties of MBene nanosheets by vacancy engineering, offering the possibilities for development of practical spintronic devices.

The Mo&lt;sub&gt;4/3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties, with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300&#160;K, while vacancy-free MoB MBene exhibits paramagnetism. It is elucidated that the Mo-vacancy defect generates large density of states near the Fermi surface and spontaneously spin-split bands through first-principles calculations, which contributes to the non-zero magnetic moment in Mo&lt;sub&gt;4/3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. This work lays the groundwork for activating the magnetic properties of MBene nanosheets by vacancy engineering, offering the possibilities for development of practical spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage of Twisted Structures in Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using machine learning, a variety of PU&#8208;based polymers are forecasted and successfully synthesized two with a high dielectric constant (K) and thermal stability. Combining these with PI via hydrogen bonds to form twisted HNP, both K and Eb are improved. Impressively, HNP&#8208;20% reaches an Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess outstanding advantages for high&#8208;power energy storage applications such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while both of them decrease rapidly at elevated temperatures. Although several strategies have been evaluated to enhance Eb and heat resistance, the discharged energy density (Ud) is still limited by the planar conjugated structure. In this study, a novel approach to manipulate polymer morphology is introduced, thereby influencing dielectric properties. A range of polyurea (PU)&#8208;based polymers are predicted from different structural unit combinations by machine learning and synthesized two representative polymers with high dielectric constants (K) and thermal stability. These polymers are combined with PI to form a twisted polymer via hydrogen bonding interactions (HNP). Both experimental results and computational simulations demonstrate the twisted structure disrupts the conjugated structure to widen the bandgap and increase dipole moment through the twisting of polar groups, leading to simultaneous improvements in both K and Eb. Consequently, HNP&#8208;20% achieves an ultrahigh Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200 &#176;C. This work opens a new avenue to scalable high Ud all&#8208;polymer dielectric for high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Chiral Nematic Graphene Films with a mesoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition method is presented for the precise fabrication of chiral nematic graphene film, which exhibits uniform Na plating without dendrite formation and noteworthy thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding performance. This work paves the way for creating a large family of chiral nematic materials in various applications of photoelectric conversion, energy storage, electromagnetism, and separation.








Abstract
Ordering a crucial material like pure&#8208;graphene into the chiral nematic structure can potentially revolutionize the fields of photonics, chiral separation, and energy storage. However, the controlled fabrication of highly ordered graphene films with a long&#8208;range chiral nematic mesoporous structure is very challenging and as such, has not been achieved. Here, a chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition growth strategy is presented for the precise fabrication of mesoporous chiral nematic graphene films by using nanocrystalline cellulose as templates. It is evidenced that such graphene films possess the left&#8208;hand helical ordering, chiral nematic mesoporous structure with adjustable pore sizes (6.4&#8211;13.1&#160;nm), tailored pitch, excellent electrical conductivity (556 S cm&#8722;1), high specific surface area (1508 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and mechanical flexibility. By coating Na anode with this film, uniform Na plating is achieved with no dendrite formation, resulting from its unique chiral nematic structure and tunable physicochemical properties. The films also achieved impressive thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding, i.e., 35&#8211;63&#160;dB, demonstrating their potentially multi&#8208;disciplinary applications.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Functionalized Cellulose Hydrogel Electrolyte for Dual&#8208;Interface Stabilization in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique one&#8208;gel&#8208;for&#8208;two&#8208;electrodes strategy is developed to simultaneously solve the challenges at both anode and cathode interfaces in aqueous zinc batteries. By constructing a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized cellulose hydrogel electrolyte, the solvation structure of Zn2+ at Zn anode and the unfavored deposition of byproducts at phenazine cathode can be effectively regulated, thus enabling the dendrite&#8208;free and side reaction&#8208;suppressed aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are considered one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, achieving a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface remains a challenge for developing high&#8208;performance AZBs. Herein, taking the Zn||phenazine (PNZ) system as a prototype, where the proton uptake/removal mechanism dominates in the cathode, a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized cellulose hydrogel electrolyte is designed to simultaneously solve the issues at both the anode and cathode interfaces. Specifically, the hydrogel electrolyte can not only regulate Zn2+ ions at the Zn anode side but also supply H+ ions at the PNZ cathode side to avoid the unfavored deposition of zinc sulfate hydroxides. Benefiting from the unique one&#8208;gel&#8208;for&#8208;two&#8208;electrodes strategy, the dendrite&#8208;free and side reaction&#8208;suppressed aqueous Zn||PNZ cells are developed with a high specific capacity (311 mAh g&#8722;1, 99% utilization of the theoretical capacity) and a long cycle life (over 1500 cycles within 2 months). This study proposes a facile and low&#8208;cost electrolyte strategy for stabilizing AZBs.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell and Zn&#8208;Air Battery via Hole Inner Edge Reconstruction of 2D Pd Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widespread hole inner edge reconstruction (HIER) phenomenon as overstretched outermost crystal facets is revealed in Pd nanomeshes prepared through a facile gram&#8208;scale room&#8208;temperature reduction method. Contributed by the HIER phenomenon, a tremendous improvement in the electrocatalytic activity is identified, which significantly improved the anion exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn&#8208;air batteries assembled with Pd NM/C cathode catalyst.








Abstract
Platinum group metals (PGM) have yet to be the most active catalysts in various sustainable energy reactions. Their high cost, however, has made maximizing the activity and minimizing the dosage become an urgent priority for the practical applications of emerging technologies. Herein, a novel 2D&#160;Pd nanomesh structure possessing hole inner reconstructed edges (HIER) with exposed high energy facets and overstretched lattice parameters is fabricated through a facile room&#8208;temperature reduction method at gram&#8208;scale yields. The HIER enhances the catalytic performance of Pd in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), achieving superior mass activity (MA) of 2.672 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 27.8 fold and 23.6 fold higher, respectively, than those of the commercial Pt/C (0.096 A mgPt&#8722;1) and Pd/C (0.113 A mgPd&#8722;1) at 0.9 VRHE. Most significantly, in H2&#8208;air anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) applications, this unique Pd catalyst delivers a much&#8208;outperformed peak power density of 0.86 and 0.22&#160;W cm&#8722;2, respectively, compared with 0.54 and 0.13&#160;W cm&#8722;2 of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, indicating a novel pathway in electrocatalyst designs through HIER engineering.

         <title>Unlocking the Trade&#8208;off Between Intrinsic and Interfacial Thermal Transport of Boron Nitride Nanosheets by Surface Functionalization for Advanced Thermal Interface Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) within thermal interface material. The surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high thermal conductivity of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix.








Abstract
The increasing computing power of AI presents a major challenge for high&#8208;power chip solution and heat dissipation. Boron nitride nanosheet&#8208;based thermal interface materials (BNNS&#8208;based TIMs) exhibit excellent electrical insulation property, ensuring the secure and stable operation of chips. However, the efficiency of micro/nano interfacial thermal transport is limited, impeding further enhancements in the thermal conductivity (TC) of BNNS&#8208;based TIMs. Here, a strategy of surface functionalization is reported to unlock the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of BNNS within TIMs. These results suggest that the surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high TC of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix by 50% and 26.1%, respectively. The BNNS&#8208;based TIMs exhibit excellent TC (&#8776;21&#8211;25&#160;W/(m&#183;K)) and ultralow Young's modulus, which can promote the development of flexible high&#8208;performance chip cooling technology in the AI industry.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Electronic Properties of Cobalt Oxide via &#8220;Tb&#8221; Single Atom for Uphill Urea and Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen (H2) production via water electrolysis benefits from switching the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The topologically doped rare&#8208;earth single atom &#8216;Tb&#8217; on defective Co3O4 (TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4) achieves superior UOR performance. The catalyst achieves 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.27&#160;V, &#8722;35&#160;mV, and 1.22&#160;V for UOR, H2 evolution reaction, and Bifunctional UOR electrolyzer, respectively with remarkable stability.








Abstract
Exploring single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysts in hybrid urea&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers a viable alternative to both Hydrogen (H2) generation and polluted water treatment. However, the unfavorable electronic stabilization, low SA content, intrinsically slow kinetics, and imbalanced adsorption&#8208;desorption steps are the bottleneck for its scale&#8208;up implementation. Herein, a rare&#8208;earth Terbium single atom (TbSA) is topologically stabilized on defect&#8208;rich Co3O4 (TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4) by Tb&#9472;O co&#8208;ordination for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and H2 evolution reaction (HER). Benefitting from the strong TbSA interaction with the d&#8208;Co3O4, the TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.27&#160;V and &#8722;35&#160;mV for UOR and HER, respectively. Remarkably, when TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4 is applied as a bi&#8208;functional catalyst in a two&#8208;electrode system, it merely requires 1.22&#160;V to acquire 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with excellent operational stability for 100 h. The hybrid electrolyzer can be successfully empowered by the triboelectric nanogenerator, AA battery, and solar panel with a nominal potential of 1.5&#160;V. The mechanistic investigation predicts &#8220;TbSA&#8221; insertion in d&#8208;Co3O4 lowered the potential determining step, attributed to balanced reaction energetics for adsorption&#8208;desorption of intermediates and favorable charge transfer characteristics for UOR. This work offers a new paradigm to explore the catalytic properties of rare&#8208;earth &#8220;f&#8208;block&#8221; elements to create advanced electrocatalysts via structural modulation.

         <title>Reversible Configurations of 3&#8208;Coordinate and 4&#8208;Coordinate Boron Stabilize Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathodes with Superior Cycling Stability for Practical Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work demonstrates a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, delivering a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This is the first time to realize the real B&#8208;doping, which exists in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations with high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, greatly stabilizing oxygen anions and impeding Ni&#8208;ion migration with high structure stability and rapid Li&#8208;ion diffusion.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes are the leading candidate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and ultrahigh capacity. However, the increased Ni content causes larger volume variations and worse lattice oxygen stability during cycling, resulting in capacity attenuation and kinetics hysteresis. Herein, a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode that well&#8208;addresses all the above issues, which is also the first time to realize the real doping of B ions is demonstrated. The as&#8208;obtained cathode delivers a reversible capacity of up to 237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 (924 Wh kg&#8722;1cathode) and a superior capacity retention of 84.2% after 500 cycles at 1C in pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cells. Advanced characterizations and calculations verify that the boron&#8208;doping is existed in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations and their high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, which greatly stabilizes oxygen anions and impedes Ni&#8208;ion migration to Li layer. Furthermore, the B&#8208;doping engineers the primary particle microstructure for better relaxing the lattice strain and accelerating Li&#8208;ion diffusion. This work advances the energy density of cathode materials into the domain of above 900&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and the concept will inspire more intensive study on ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable PHT aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and PFA. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of materials renowned for their ultralow thermal conductivity and highly porous architecture, making them ideal for applications in thermal insulation, catalysis, and chemical absorption. However, these polymeric networks pose environmental concerns as their permanently crosslinked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. To tackle this issue and develop next&#8208;generation organic aerogel, a set of polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT)&#160;aerogels specifically designed for closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling are prepared. Remarkably, these innovative materials can selectively be synthesized in a one&#8208;step condensation reaction using commercially available aromatic amines.

     alt="One-Step Synthesis of Closed-Loop Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple one-step synthesis of closed-loop recyclable PHT aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and PFA. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic aerogels are an advanced class of materials renowned for their ultralow thermal conductivity and highly porous architecture, making them ideal for applications in thermal insulation, catalysis, and chemical absorption. However, these polymeric networks pose environmental concerns as their permanently crosslinked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. To tackle this issue and develop next-generation organic aerogel, a set of polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT)&#160;aerogels specifically designed for closed-loop chemical recycling are prepared. Remarkably, these innovative materials can selectively be synthesized in a one-step condensation reaction using commercially available aromatic amines. They showcase outstanding thermally insulating performance, along with strong mechanical performance, pronounced thermal stability, and intrinsic hydrophobicity, all achieved without the need for additional modifications. More importantly, these aerogels exhibit quantitative depolymerization under acidic aqueous conditions, achieving high yields and purities of the recovered monomers. The successful preparation of fresh organic aerogels from recycled monomers with nearly identical material properties underscores the efficiency and reliability of this recycling process. The facile one-step synthesis process, combined with the high-performance properties and excellent recyclability of these PHT aerogels, accelerates the advancement of sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anomalously High Apparent Young's Modulus of Ultrathin Freestanding PZT Films Revealed by Machine Learning Empowered Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neural network machine learning model is developed to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves, with which anomalously high Young's modulus is discovered of ultrathin PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4 &#177; 12.1 GPa. The enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776; 200 nC&#160;m&#8722;1.








Abstract
The mechanical properties at small length scales are not only significant for understanding the intriguing size&#8208;dependent behaviors but also critical for device applications. Nanoindentation via atomic force microscopy is widely used for small&#8208;scale mechanical testing, yet determining the Young's modulus of quasi&#8208;2D films from freestanding force&#8211;displacement curve of nanoindentation remains challenging, complicated by both bending and stretching that are highly nonlinear. To overcome these difficulties, a machine learning model is developed based on the back propagation (BP) neural network and finite element training to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves simultaneously, improving the computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude over conventional brute force curve fitting. Using this technique, anomalously high apparent Young's modulus is discovered of 2.8&#160;nm thick PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4&#160;&#177;&#160;12.1&#160;GPa, much higher than the bulk value. The enhancement can be attributed to the strain gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776;200&#160;nC&#160;m&#8722;1. The method is developed to enable an artificial intelligence (AI) system to study the mechanical properties of a wide range of low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Engineered Biomimetic Cancer Cell Membrane Nanosystems Trigger Gas&#8208;Immunometabolic Therapy for Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) generated by MP@AL&#8208;mediated gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy inhibited tumor cell respiration, on the one hand, to ensure the continuation of the lactate depletion response and reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, and on the other hand, NO&#8208;induced tumor immunogenic cell death, synergistically stimulating the immune response and amplifying the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Despite great progress in enhancing tumor immunogenicity, conventional gas therapy cannot effectively reverse the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME), limiting immunotherapy. The development of therapeutic gases that are tumor microenvironment responsive and efficiently reverse the TIME for precisely targeted tumor gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy remains a great challenge. In this study, a novel cancer cell membrane&#8208;encapsulated pH&#8208;responsive nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing biomimetic nanosystem (MP@AL) is prepared. Lactate oxidase (Lox) in MP@AL consumed oxygen to promote the decomposition of lactate, a metabolic by&#8208;product of tumor glycolysis, and the generation of H2O2, while L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;Arg) in MP@AL is oxidized by H2O2 to generate nitric oxide (NO). For one thing, NO led to mitochondrial dysfunction in tumor cells to reduce oxygen consumption and promote the efficiency of Lox in lactate decomposition, thus reversing lactate&#8208;induced TIME; for another, NO effectively triggered immunogenic cell death, activated anti&#8208;tumor immune response and long&#8208;term immune memory, and ensured a favorable effect in the synergistic interaction with PD&#8208;L1 antibody for inhibiting tumor growth and recurrence. Therefore, a novel gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy dual closed&#8208;loop nanosystem for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and remodeling lactate&#8208;induced TIME is established. Overall, this work will provide new ideas for gas therapy to effectively remodel the TIME to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Congruent Glass Composite Scintillator for Efficient High&#8208;Energy Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The congruent glass composite scintillator with good processing capability&#160;and high scintillation light yield is constructed, which solves the problem of poor preparation and processing properties of scintillation single crystal and ceramic. The constructed glass composite scintillator is further verified in applications such as X&#8208;ray imaging and real&#8208;time radiation detection of fibers. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.








Abstract
The scintillator is the most crucial component in the high&#8208;energy ray detection system. The available scintillators suffer from the insurmountable drawbacks including poor shaping ability for single crystal and ceramic and low efficiency for glass. Here, a glass composite scintillator is proposed from a congruent crystallization system which possesses both excellent processability and high scintillating yield. It can be fabricated into diverse shapes and sizes including the bulk and tiny fiber. Benefitting from the unique compositing combination with a high crystallization ratio, the glass composite exhibits a giant scintillating light yield of &#8776;26,000 photons per MeV. The practical application for X&#8208;ray imaging is demonstrated and a high spatial resolution of 12 l&#160;p&#160;mm&#8722;1 is achieved. Furthermore, the fiber derived detector is built and the remote and micro&#8208;area detection is realized. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.

         <title>Dynamic Transition Metal Network via Orbital Population Design Stabilizes Lattice Oxygen Redox in Stoichiometric Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered transition metal (TM) network is crucial for the activity and reversibility of lattice oxygen in batteries. A t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work establishes a promising pathway for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes by controlling TM ordering.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries employing stoichiometric layered Li metal oxides as cathodes are now reaching the energy density limits due to single cationic redox chemistry. Lattice oxygen redox (LOR) has been discovered in these materials, as a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density paradigm observed in Li&#8208;rich materials. Nevertheless, the origin of this process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, employing stoichiometric Ni&#8208;based cathodes, it is demonstrated that LOR originates from a dynamic transition metal (TM) network caused by ion migration during the electrochemical process. This network is confirmed to be ribbon through both ex&#8208; and in&#8208;situ STEM observations, facilitating reversible LOR. Finally, a t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work explains the mechanism of LOR in stoichiometric layered cathode materials, and sets a promising direction for the design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes through the regulation of TM ordering.

         <title>Superhydrophobicity With Self&#8208;Adaptive Water Pressure Resistance and Adhesion of Pistia Stratiotes Leaf</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pistia stratiotes leaf exhibits superhydrophobicity with high water pressure resistance and low adhesion, attributed to its self&#8208;adaptive deformable microstructure with unique re&#8208;entrant features. Under pressure, these microstructures deform to increase the solid&#8208;liquid contact area, enhancing water pressure resistance. The re&#8208;entrant features elevate the deformation threshold, enabling an effective adaptive response.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces are promising for optimizing amphibious aircraft by minimizing water drag and adhesion. Achieving this involves ensuring these surfaces can resist high liquid pressure caused by deep water and fluid flow. Maximizing the solid&#8208;liquid contact area is a common strategy to improve liquid pressure resistance. However, this approach inevitably increases solid&#8208;liquid adhesion, making it challenging to guarantee a trade&#8208;off between the two wetting characteristics. Here, it is found that the Pistia stratiotes leaf exhibits superhydrophobicity with high water pressure resistance and low adhesion, attributed to its self&#8208;adaptive deformable microstructure with unique re&#8208;entrant features. Under pressure, these microstructures deform to increase the solid&#8208;liquid contact area, thereby enhancing water pressure resistance. The re&#8208;entrant features elevate the deformation threshold, enabling higher modulus microstructures to achieve adaptive response. This facilitates the recovery of deformed microstructures, restoring the air layer and maintaining low adhesion. Following these concepts, Pistia stratiotes leaf&#8208;inspired surfaces are fabricated, achieving an 183% improvement in water impact resistance and an &#8776;80% reduction in adhesion after overpressure compared to conventional superhydrophobic surfaces. The design principles inspired by Pistia stratiotes promise significant advancements in amphibious aircraft and other trans&#8208;media vehicles.

         <title>In&#8208;Device Ballistic&#8208;Electron&#8208;Emission Spectroscopy for Accurately In Situ Mapping Energy Level Alignment at Metal&#8211;Organic Semiconductors Interface</title>

         <dc:description>
A precise in situ method&#8212;employing in&#8208;device ballistic&#8208;electron&#8208;emission spectroscopy with hot&#8208;electron transistor configuration&#8212;is presented for detecting energy barriers at metal/organic semiconductor interfaces, achieving an accuracy of &#177;0.03&#160;eV. This technique is applicable to n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type and ambipolar semiconductors and can detect subtle barrier changes caused by film treatment processes, providing a reliable tool for organic electronics.








Abstract
Energy level alignment at metal/organic semiconductors (OSCs) interface governs electronic processes in organic electronics devices, making its precise determination essential for understanding carrier transport behaviors and optimizing device performance. However, it is proven that accurately characterizing the energy barrier at metal/OSC interface under operational conditions remains challenging due to the technical limitations of traditional methods. Herein, through integrating highly&#8208;improved device constructions with an ingenious derivative&#8208;assisted data processing method, this study demonstrates an in&#8208;device ballistic&#8208;electron&#8208;emission spectroscopy using hot&#8208;electron transistors to accurately characterize the energy barrier at metal/OSC interface under in&#8208;operando conditions. This technique is found that a remarkable improvement in measurement accuracy, reaching up to &#177;0.03&#160;eV, can be achieved&#8212;surpassing previous techniques (&#177;0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;eV). The high accuracy allows us to monitor subtle changes in energy barriers at metal/OSC interface caused by variations in the aggregation state of OSCs, a phenomenon that is theoretically possible but failed to be directly demonstrated through conventional methods. Moreover, this study makes demonstration that this technology is universally applicable to various metal/OSC interfaces consisting of electron&#8208;transporting, hole&#8208;transporting, and ambipolar OSCs. These findings manifest the great potential of this method to advance both theoretical exploration and technical applications in organic electronics.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulation of Atomically Precise Nanoclusters in Reticular Frameworks via Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical synthesis approach to encapsulate atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) in reticular frameworks in a controlled manner is proposed. This method significantly broadens the range of APNC@framework composites, facilitating the on&#8208;demand construction and regulation of component&#8208;specific nanocomposites.








Abstract
The combination of atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) and reticular frameworks is promising for generating component&#8208;specific nanocomposites with emergent properties. However, traditional liquid&#8208;phase synthesis often hampers this potential by damaging APNCs and limiting combination diversity. Here, mechanochemical synthesis to explore the encapsulation of diverse oil&#8208; and water&#8208;soluble APNCs within various reticular frameworks is employed, establishing a database of 21 unique APNC&#8722;framework combinations, including metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8722;organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen&#8722;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), and multivariate MOFs. These framework coatings not only spatially immobilize APNCs but also secure their structures, preventing aggregation and degradation while enhancing stability and activity. Encapsulating Au25 in HOFs resulted in a remarkable 315&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Au25 homogeneous catalyst, highlighting the framework's crucial role in catalytic enhancement. The mechanochemical synthesis strategy facilitates tailored support screening, catering to specific needs, and shows promise for developing multifunctional systems, including enzyme&#8722;APNC@frameworks material for cascade reactions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Level Chirality Transfer and Amplification in Liquid Crystal Supramolecular Assembly for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from point chirality of small molecules to helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals consisting of chiral nonfluorescent polymers and nematic liquid crystals is constructed. Full&#8208;color and white CPL are realized via further introducing achiral fluorophores. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed.








Abstract
Chiral liquid crystal supramolecular assembly provides an ideal strategy for constructing excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, the chirality transfer in chiral liquid crystals normally occurs at two levels from the configurational chirality to the supramolecular phase chirality. The more precise and more levels of chirality transmission are fascinating but remain challenging. The present work reports the first success of three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from configurationally point chirality of small molecules to conformationally helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular phase chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals composed of chiral nonfluorescent polymers (P46) and nematic liquid crystals. Noticeably, the helical twisting power of P46 is five&#8208;fold larger than its monomer. Full&#8208;color and white CPL with maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor up to 1.54 and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63.8% are realized utilizing helical supramolecular assembly combined with selective reflection mechanism. Also significantly, the electrically stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL switching device as well as anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed. This study deepens the understanding of chirality transfer and amplification across different hierarchical levels.

         <title>Augmenting Protein Degradation Capacity of PROTAC through Energy Metabolism Regulation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>

A strategy is presented to augment the protein degradation capability of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) by modulating external nutrient supply and employing nanocarrier&#8208;based targeted delivery. The results demonstrate that a reduction in nutrient supply can enhance protein metabolism and significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs when combined with nanocarriers.








Abstract
The ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degrading over 70&#8211;80% of cellular proteins. Consequently, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are developed to induce the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins of interest (POIs) by the UPS. To amplify the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs, energy metabolism regulation is first harnessed to boost UPS function in tumor cells. Proteomic and ubiquitinome analyzes reveal that total ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome activity are significantly increased in 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells following fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) treatment. As a result, the degradation efficiency of PROTACs targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK&#8208;P) or bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4&#8208;P) is significantly enhanced in FMD&#8208;treated 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells. Then, silica&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticles are developed modified with tumor cell membranes for targeted delivery of PROTACs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging confirm that nanocarriers significantly improve the delivery efficiency of PROTACs in FMD&#8208;treated 143B or MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumors. In vivo studies demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of FAK&#8208;P and BRD4&#8208;P is greatly augmented when combined with targeted delivery and FMD treatment. Overall, this study presents a strategy to enhance the efficacy of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Durable Organic Coating&#8208;Free Superhydrophobic Metal Surface by Paracrystalline State Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic coating&#8208;free durable self&#8208;superhydrophobic metal surface is achieved by a strategy of femtosecond laser element doping microstructuring on Al alloys followed by repetitive low&#8208;temperature annealing in this work. This novel design, which endows the metal surface with properties of unique air storage nanostructures, low free energy, and high chemical stability, can effectively avoid disadvantages of traditional sticking organic modifiers to long&#8208;termly keep the extreme water repellency.








Abstract
The chemical instability of traditional organically&#8208;decorated superhydrophobic metal surfaces is a significant issue, severely limiting practical applications. This is due to the susceptibility of low surface energy coatings to ion permeation, decomposition, and exfoliation, especially in harsh environments. Here, organic coating&#8208;free, durable superhydrophobic surfaces on Al alloys by developing the paracrystalline state of a bionic anthill tribe structure is successfully achieved, using femtosecond laser element&#8208;doping microstructuring followed by repetitive annealing processes. Remarkably, the inherent superhydrophobic properties of the sample are maintained for &#8776;2000 h in a corrosive 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, significantly surpassing the performance of traditional organic coatings. Moreover, this inherent superhydrophobicity remains nearly unchanged, even after rigorous electrochemical reaction measurements. Additional tests involving UV irradiation (&gt;100 h), freezing cycles (&gt;100 cycles), and acid/alkali resistance (&gt;65 h) further demonstrate that the environmental adaptability of the surface far exceeds that of silane&#8208;coated surfaces. Ab initio calculations reveal that the formation of the paracrystalline state reduces surface energy and enhances chemical stability, thereby extending the durability of the superhydrophobic metal. These findings offer a powerful strategy for utilizing atomic&#8208;level structural rearrangements to design inherent superhydrophobic surfaces without the need for organic coatings.

         <title>A Synergistically Enhanced Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Generator Enabled by Multifunctional Amorphous Alloy for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Powered System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating multifunctional Fe72Si8B20 into the hybrid generator not only increases the output current and current retention of TENG by 28.75% and 85.24%, respectively, but also boosts the output power of EMG by 51.05%. Additionally, the variable impedance system effectively utilizes the output characteristics of TENG and EMG, resulting in a 198% improvement in energy utilization efficiency compared to conventional constant impendence systems.








Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid generator (TEHG) has emerged as an effective technology for mechanical energy harvesting. However, the independent operation of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG), along with tribo&#8208;materials wear and magnetic field divergence, constrain the device's overall performance. To address these challenges, a synergistically enhanced TEHG (SE&#8208;TEHG) is proposed based on the multifunctional amorphous alloy. Following detailed material analyses, Fe72Si8B20 is selected as the synergistic layer for its low surface roughness, high Vickers&#8208;hardness, amorphous structure, and high magnetization. Compared to Al, this material not only boosts TENG's output current and current retention rate by 28.75% and 85.24%, but also improves EMG's output power by 51.05%. In constructing a self&#8208;powered system with TEHG, a significant impedance discrepancy exists between the energy harvester (with matched impendence of 16 M&#937; for TENG and 110 k&#937; for EMG) and the application end. Without power management circuits, the demonstrated self&#8208;powered variable impedance system achieves an energy utilization efficiency that is 2.98 times greater than the conventional constant impedance system. The integration of multifunctional materials to realize strong&#8208;coupling hybrid generators, combined with the customization of variable impedance systems, set a milestone in efficient mechanical energy harvesting and utilization.

         <title>Mesoporous Acridinium&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated Exciton Mediated Photocatalytic [4+2] Annulation</title>

         <dc:description>
An Acridinium&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COFs) featuring systematic trap states is designed to generate charge&#8208;separated excitons with enhanced lifetime. Large 4&#160;nm&#8208;sized mesoporous channels and ultra&#8208;stable excitons resulted in the COF functioning as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst toward Diels&#8208;Alder type oxidative [4+2] annulation with a million times enhanced interfacial charge dissipation response.








Abstract
Readily tuneable porosity and redox properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) result in highly customizable photocatalysts featuring extended electronic delocalization. However, fast charge recombination in COFs severely limits their photocatalytic activities. Herein a new mode of COF photocatalyst design strategy to introduce systematic trap states is programmed, which aids the formation and stabilization of long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated excitons. Installing cationic acridinium functionality in a pristine electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine COF via postsynthetic modification resulted in a semiconducting photocatalytic donor&#8211;acceptor dyad network that performed rapid and efficient oxidative Diels&#8208;Alder type [4+2] annulation of styrenes and alkynes to fused aromatic compounds under the atmospheric condition in good to excellent yields. Large mesopores of &#8776;4&#160;nm diameter ensured efficient mass flow within the COF channel. It is confirmed that the catalytic performance of COF originates from the ultra&#8208;stable charge&#8208;separated excitons of 1.9&#160;nm diameter with no apparent radiative charge&#8208;recombination pathway, endorsing almost a million times better photo&#8208;response and catalysis than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Facet&#8208;Selective Copper Nanowires for Activating CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a nickel&#8208;doped copper nanowire catalyst for highly selective ethanol production from CO electroreduction. The theoretical calculations and operando spectroelectrochemical investigations cooperatively demonstrate that nickel&#8208;doping onto copper surface can regulate the interfacial water structure and water dissociation kinetics, which significantly influences the hydrogenation kinetics of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH), and thus leading to a high selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol.








Abstract
Ethanol isa promising energy vector for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle through reversible electrochemical redox. Currently, ethanol electrosynthesissuffers from low product selectivity due to the competitive advantage of ethylene in CO2/CO electroreduction. Here, a facet&#8208;selective metal&#8208;doping strategy is reported, tuning the reaction kinetics of CO reduction paths and thus enhancing the ethanol selectivity. The theoretical calculations reveal that nickel (Ni)doped Cu(100) surface facilitates water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen, which promotesselective electrochemical hydrogenation of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH) toward ethanol path over ethylene path. Experimentally, a solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a Ni&#8208;doped {100}&#8208;dominated Copper nanowires (Cu NWs) catalyst is reported, enabling an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a selectivity ratio of ethanol to ethylene of 2.7, which are &#8776;4 and 15 times larger than those of undoped Cu NWs, respectively. The operando spectroscopic characterizations&#160;confirm that Ni&#8208;doping in Cu NWs can alter the interfacial water activity and thus regulate the C2 product selectivity.

     alt="Nickel-Doped Facet-Selective Copper Nanowires for Activating CO-to-Ethanol Electrosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research reports a nickel-doped copper nanowire catalyst for highly selective ethanol production from CO electroreduction. The theoretical calculations and operando spectroelectrochemical investigations cooperatively demonstrate that nickel-doping onto copper surface can regulate the interfacial water structure and water dissociation kinetics, which significantly influences the hydrogenation kinetics of a key C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate (&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CHCOH), and thus leading to a high selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol isa promising energy vector for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle through reversible electrochemical redox. Currently, ethanol electrosynthesissuffers from low product selectivity due to the competitive advantage of ethylene in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO electroreduction. Here, a facet-selective metal-doping strategy is reported, tuning the reaction kinetics of CO reduction paths and thus enhancing the ethanol selectivity. The theoretical calculations reveal that nickel (Ni)doped Cu(100) surface facilitates water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen, which promotesselective electrochemical hydrogenation of a key C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate (&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CHCOH) toward ethanol path over ethylene path. Experimentally, a solution-phase synthesis of a Ni-doped {100}-dominated Copper nanowires (Cu NWs) catalyst is reported, enabling an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a selectivity ratio of ethanol to ethylene of 2.7, which are &#8776;4 and 15 times larger than those of undoped Cu NWs, respectively. The operando spectroscopic characterizations&#160;confirm that Ni-doping in Cu NWs can alter the interfacial water activity and thus regulate the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; product selectivity. With further electrode engineering, a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer using Ni-doped Cu NWs catalysts demonstrates an ethanol Faradaic efficiency over 50% at 300&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a full cell voltage of &#8776;2.7&#160;V and operates stably for over 300 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoelectric Heterojunctions as Bacteria&#8208;Killing Bone&#8208;Regenerative Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2/Bi2WO6 piezoelectric heterojunctions with engineered oxygen vacancies, interfacial built&#8208;in electric fields and piezoelectric properties are constructed as bone implants. The heterojunctions achieve highly efficient and dynamic antimicrobial functions through near infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered photothermal and photodynamic therapies. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implants trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields in situ, significantly promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Heterojunctions are widely used in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and photodetection, but have not been fully explored in regenerative medicine. In particular, piezoelectric heterojunctions have never been examined in tissue regeneration. Here the development of piezoelectric heterojunctions is shown to promote bone regeneration while eradicating pathogenic bacteria through light&#8208;cellular force&#8208;electric coupling. Specifically, an array of heterojunctions (TiO2/Bi2WO6), made of piezoelectric nanocrystals (Bi2WO6) decorating TiO2 nanowires, is fabricated as a biocompatible implant. Upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light, the piezoelectric heterojunctions generate reactive oxygen species and heat to kill bacteria through photodynamic and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implant trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields that further promote osteogenesis to achieve osteointegration. The heterojunctions effectively suppress postoperative recurrent infections while promoting osseointegration through the local electric fields induced by cells. Therefore, the piezoelectric heterojunctions represent a promising antibacterial tissue&#8208;regenerative implant.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Electrical Decoupled Phototransistor for Starlight Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study develops a heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) based on an opto&#8208;electric decoupling mechanism, designed to suppress noise and enhance sensitivity, enabling starlight detection. The infrared HGFET detector demonstrates a detectivity exceeding 1014 Jones at 1300 nm, with a detectable radiation intensity as low as 0.46 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a maximum speed in tens of microseconds, showing great potential for high&#8208;resolution, cost&#8208;effective passive night vision imaging sensors.








Abstract
Highly sensitive shortwave infrared (SWIR) detectors are essential for detecting weak radiation (typically below 10&#8722;8 W&#183;Sr&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;&#181;m&#8722;1) with high&#8208;end passive image sensors. However, mainstream SWIR detection based on epitaxial photodiodes cannot effectively detect ultraweak infrared radiation due to the lack of inherent gain. Here, we develop a heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) consisting of a colloidal quantum dot (CQD)&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n heterojunction and a carbon nanotube (CNT) field&#8208;effect transistor, which achieves a high inherent gain based on an opto&#8208;electric decoupling mechanism for suppressing noise. The stacked heterojunction absorbs infrared radiation and separates electron&#8211;hole pairs. Then, the generated photovoltage tunes the drain current of the CNT FET through an Y2O3 gate insulator. As a result, the HGFET significantly detects and amplifies SWIR signals with a high inherent gain while minimally amplifying noise, leading to a recorded specific detectivity above 1014&#8201;Jones at 1300&#160;nm and a recorded maximum gain&#8208;bandwidth product of 69.2 THz. Direct comparative testing indicates that the HGFET can detect weak infrared radiation at 0.46 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 levels; thus, compared to commercial and reported SWIR detectors, this detector is much more sensitive and enables starlight detection or vision. As the fabrication process is very compatible with CMOS readout integrated circuits, the HGFET is a promising SWIR detector for realizing passive night vision imaging sensors with high resolutions that are high&#8208;end, highly sensitive, and inexpensive.

         <title>Balanced Miscibility and Crystallinity by 2D Acceptors Enabled Halogen&#8208;Free Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells to Achieve 19.28% Efficiency</title>

Linear and branch side chains on chemical structures lead to the unique crystal structures of the elliptical and rectangular frameworks, respectively. The difference in intermolecular interaction significantly impacts the self&#8208;aggregation tendency and compatibility with a guest acceptor. It found that excessive crystallinity with great self&#8208;aggregation negatively affected molecular packing, while a moderate crystalline collaborated well with the guest acceptor and achieved a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 19.28% based on scalable and stable halogen&#8208;free solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells.








Abstract
Two highly crystalline 2D acceptors, ATIC&#8208;C11 and ATIC&#8208;BO, with acenaphthene&#8208;expanded quinoxaline central cores, have been demonstrated with very different characteristics in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). The difference in side chains induces their distinctive molecular packing mode and unique crystal structure, in which ATIC&#8208;C11 displays a 3D structure with an elliptical framework, and ATIC&#8208;BO gives a rectangular framework. Their high crystallinity contributes to organized molecular packing in ternary devices, thus low energetic disorder and suppressed energy loss. Through the analysis of morphology and carrier kinetics, it is found that ATIC&#8208;BO's strong self&#8208;aggregation and immiscibility induce large aggregates and severely impede charge transfer (CT) and dissociation. Conversely, ATIC&#8208;C11's suitable crystallinity and compatibility positively regulate the crystalline kinetics during film formation, thus forming much&#8208;ordered molecular packing and favorable phase separation size in blend films. As a result, ATIC&#8208;C11&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a high efficiency of 19.28% with potential in scalability and stability, which is the top&#8208;ranking efficiency among nonhalogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. This work not only displays highly efficient and stable halogen&#8208;free solvent&#8208;processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs), but also offers a new thought for material design and selection rule on the third component in highly efficient ternary OSCs.

         <title>Fabrication of Ultrathin Ferroelectric Al0.7Sc0.3N Films under Complementary&#8208;Metal&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Semiconductor Compatible Conditions by using HfN0.4 Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), an innovative material for ferroelectric memory applications, is scaled down to an ultra&#8208;thin thickness of 3 nm while maintaining compatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor fabrication standards, marking a notable breakthrough in the field. Moreover, reducing the operating voltage to 4.35 V represents a significant milestone in advancing low&#8208;voltage AlScN&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memories, offering a much higher remanent charge density than other materials with a stable ferroelectric phase. However, the inherently high coercive field requires a substantial decrease in film thickness to lower the operating voltage. Significant leakage currents present a severe challenge during the thickness scaling, especially when maintaining compatibility with complementary&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication standards. This study adopts a HfN0.4 bottom electrode, which minimizes lattice mismatch with Al0.7Sc0.3N (ASN), forming a coherent bottom interface that effectively reduces leakage currents even at thickness &lt;&#160;5&#160;nm.

&lt;p&gt;Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), an innovative material for ferroelectric memory applications, is scaled down to an ultra-thin thickness of 3 nm while maintaining compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication standards, marking a notable breakthrough in the field. Moreover, reducing the operating voltage to 4.35 V represents a significant milestone in advancing low-voltage AlScN-based devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation ferroelectric memories, offering a much higher remanent charge density than other materials with a stable ferroelectric phase. However, the inherently high coercive field requires a substantial decrease in film thickness to lower the operating voltage. Significant leakage currents present a severe challenge during the thickness scaling, especially when maintaining compatibility with complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication standards. This study adopts a HfN&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt; bottom electrode, which minimizes lattice mismatch with Al&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;N (ASN), forming a coherent bottom interface that effectively reduces leakage currents even at thickness &amp;lt;&#160;5&#160;nm. CMOS-compatible HfN&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;/ASN/TiN stack, deposited without vacuum break between each layer, demonstrates exceptional scalability, confirming the ferroelectricity of ASN films at thicknesses down to 3&#160;nm. The coercive voltage is decreased to 4.35&#160;V, significantly advancing low-voltage AlScN devices that align with CMOS standards.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Orientation and Steric Hindrance Induced by Alkyl Chain Length in Ammonium Salt Passivator Toward High&#8208;performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic ammonium salts with varying alkyl chain lengths are used to passivate perovskite surface defects and optimize energy band alignment. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) achieves superior passivation through optimal molecular orientation and minimized steric hindrance, leading to 25.79% PCE in inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions.









Abstract
Organic ammonium salts are extensively utilized for passivating surface defects in perovskite films to mitigate trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. However, the influence of alkyl chain length on the molecular orientation and spatial steric hindrance of ammonium salt remains underexplored, hindering advancements in more effective passivators. Here, a series of organic ammonium salts is reported with varying alkyl chain lengths to passivate surface defects and optimize band alignment. It is revealed that long alkyl chains promote parallel molecular orientation on the perovskite surface, thereby reinforcing interaction with surface defects, whereas excessive chain length introduces steric hindrance, weakening anion&#8208;perovskite interactions. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) with optimal chain length achieves the ideal balance between chemical interactions, resulting in superior passivation. Through NAAc passivation, high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules are achieved, with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 25.79% (certified 25.12%) and 19.62%, respectively. This marks a record PCE for inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions. Additionally, the NAAc&#8208;passivated devices retain 91% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation. This work offers new insights into the interplay between molecular orientation and steric hindrance, advancing the design of high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Constructing 3D Crosslinked Macromolecular Networks as a Highly Efficient Interface Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D macromolecular network consisting of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) is constructed as an interface layer for Zn metal anode. The StZ network provides abundant Zn2+ transport channels and facilitates Zn2+ desolvation, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition while minimizing parasitic reactions. This approach offers an efficient strategy for achieving excellent electrochemical performance in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are experiencing rapid development due to their high theoretical capacity, abundant zinc resources, and intrinsic safety. However, the progress of AZIBs is hindered by uncontrollable parasitic reactions and excessive dendrite growth, which compromise the durability and effective utilization of zinc metal anodes. To address these challenges, the study has constructed a 3D crosslinked macromolecular network composed of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) as an interface layer on Zn foil (StZ&#8208;Zn) to inhibit hydrogen evolution, regulate Zn2+ flux, and ensure uniform Zn deposition. Density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, and in situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the 3D StZ interface layer facilitates Zn2+ desolvation by restructuring the solvation shells. This process reduces the concentration of H2O at the anode, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, Zn2+ transport is more efficient, promoting a homogeneous Zn2+ flux and enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. As a result, StZ&#8208;Zn||StZ&#8208;Zn symmetric cell delivers a superb lifespan of 4800 h at the current density of 5 mA cm&#8722;2, and the corresponding cumulative capacity is as high as 12000 mAh cm&#8722;2. Notably, StZ&#8208;Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell can stably operate for 2500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 with an outstanding capacity retention of 92%.

         <title>Adaptable Hydrogel with Strong Adhesion of Wet Tissue for Long&#8208;Term Protection of Periodontitis Wound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prime challenge in hydrogel treatment of periodontitis is short retention. An in situ light&#8208;curing hydrogel is designed to achieve long&#8208;term protection of periodontal wounds. A paste precursor is configured to achieve stayability before curing, and rapid light&#8208;curing achieves strong adhesion between hydrogel and tissue. This design concept provides a promising solution for novel long&#8208;lasting oral medical hydrogel dressings.









Abstract
Periodontitis is a severe gum infection characterized by inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth. The disease is challenging to manage due to its exposure to a wet and dynamic oral environment, where conventional hydrogels often suffer from weak adhesion, short residence time, and vulnerability to bacterial invasion. In this study, an innovative hydrogel system based on in situ light curing is proposed. The hydrogel precursor, comprising sodium alginate and a calcium ion network, is designed and adhere to the irregular and smooth surfaces of periodontal tissue before curing. Upon light irradiation, a second network polymerizes rapidly, establishing multiple interactions with the tissue, which enhances adhesion strength. Benefited from this engineering strategy, the hydrogel&#160;exhibits a low swelling rate, effectively mitigating adhesion loss in the moist oral environment. Additionally, the hydrogel demonstrates excellent long&#8208;lasting wet adhesion, maintaining its presence in periodontal tissue over 120 hours. It also serves as an effective physical barrier against bacterial invasion, achieving a blocking efficiency of 99.9%. This novel design concept offers a promising approach for developing advanced medical dressings for periodontitis, providing sustained therapeutic benefits.

         <title>Multifunctional Biocomposite Materials from Chlorella vulgaris Microalgae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fabrication and post&#8208;processing technique is introduced to achieve uniform, lightweight, biocomposites based on C. vulgaris through extrusion 3Dprinting. The bioink formulation and dehydration process yield materials with mechanical properties and thermal conductivity comparable to traditional polymer and wood&#8208;based composites. This approach can be adapted to using other microalgae for large&#8208;scale production, in response to increasing global material demand.








Abstract
Extrusion 3D&#8208;printing of biopolymers and natural fiber&#8208;based biocomposites enables the fabrication of complex structures, ranging from implants' scaffolds to eco&#8208;friendly structural materials. However, conventional polymer extrusion requires high energy consumption to reduce viscosity, and natural fiber reinforcement often requires harsh chemical treatments to improve adhesion. We address these challenges by introducing a sustainable framework to fabricate natural biocomposites using Chlorella vulgaris microalgae as the matrix. Through bioink optimization and process refinement, we produced lightweight, multifunctional materials with hierarchical architectures. Infrared spectroscopy analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding plays a critical role in the binding and reinforcement of Chlorella cells by hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). As water content decreases, the hydrogen bonding network evolves from water&#8208;mediated interactions to direct hydrogen bonds between HEC and Chlorella, enhancing the mechanical properties. A controlled dehydration process maintains continuous microalgae morphology, preventing cracking. The resulting biocomposites exhibit a bending stiffness of 1.6 GPa and isotropic heat transfer and thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature, demonstrating effective thermal insulation. These characteristics make Chlorella biocomposites promising candidates for applications requiring both structural performance and thermal insulation, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to growing environmental demands.

A controlled dehydration process maintains continuous microalgae morphology, preventing cracking. The resulting biocomposites exhibit a bending stiffness of 1.6 GPa and isotropic heat transfer and thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature, demonstrating effective thermal insulation. These characteristics make &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt; biocomposites promising candidates for applications requiring both structural performance and thermal insulation, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to growing environmental demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene Readout Silicon&#8208;Based Microtube Photodetectors for Encrypted Visible Light Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetectors are designed for Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication reception. The device enable effective photodetection and rapid readout, resulting in a 75&#160;ns response time and 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 responsivity. The photodetector achieves a 140&#176; field of view and dichroic ratio up to 16.09, offering the potential in internet of things and information security.








Abstract
The implementation of an advanced light receiver is imperative for the widespread application of visible light communication. However, the integration of multifunctional and high&#8208;performance visible light receivers is still limited by device structure and system complexity. Herein, a graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetector is proposed as the receiver for omnidirectional Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication. The integration of graphene&#8208;semiconductor material systems simultaneously ensures the effective absorption of incident light and rapid readout of photogenerated carriers, and the device exhibits an ultrafast response speed of 75&#160;ns and high responsivity of 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. In addition, the microtube photodetector realizes the omnidirectional light&#8208;trapping and enhanced polarization photodetection. As the receiving end of the visible light communication system, the microtube photodetector achieves a data rate of up to 778&#160;Mbps, a field of view of 140&#176;, and the encrypted visible light communication of polarized light, providing a new possibility for the future development of the internet of things and information security.

         <title>A Pressure&#8208;Sensitive, Repositionable Bioadhesive for Instant, Atraumatic Surgical Application on Internal Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
While ubiquitous in everyday life, pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (e.g., scotch tape) are limited to dry surfaces. By integrating hydrogels and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive that adheres to internal organs is fabricated. The unique adhesive properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives enable the atraumatic interfacing between surgical equipment and internal tissues for tissue stabilization and fault&#8208;tolerant integration of bioelectronics.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives are widely utilized due to their instant and reversible adhesion to various dry substrates. Though offering intuitive and robust attachment of medical devices on skin, currently available clinical pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives do not attach to internal organs, mainly due to the presence of interfacial water on the tissue surface that acts as a barrier to adhesion. In this work, a pressure&#8208;sensitive, repositionable bioadhesive (PSB) that adheres to internal organs by synergistically combining the characteristic viscoelastic properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives and the interfacial behavior of hydrogel bioadhesives, is introduced. Composed of a viscoelastic copolymer, the PSB absorbs interfacial water to enable instant adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, and removal after use without causing any tissue damage. The PSB's capabilities in diverse on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios including tissue stabilization of soft organs and the integration of bioelectronic devices in rat and porcine models, are demonstrated.

         <title>Photocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene to Polymer&#8208;Grade Ethylene with Molecular and Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Cobaloximes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photocatalytic systems based on homogeneous and heterogeneous cobaloximes are reported. By leveraging their hydrogen atom transfer catalytic activity, exquisitely efficient and selective acetylene photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation is reported. Integrating the cobaloximes in a metal&#8211;organic framework results in more stable and durable catalysis.








Abstract
The semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene&#8208;rich gas streams is a high&#8208;priority industrial chemical reaction for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene. Traditional thermocatalytic routes for acetylene reduction to ethylene, despite progress, still require high temperatures and high H2 consumption, possess relatively low selectivity, and use a noble metal catalyst. Light&#8208;powered strategies are starting to emerge, given that they have the potential to use directly the abundant and sustainable solar irradiation, but are ineffective. Here an efficient, &gt;99.9% selective, visible&#8208;light powered, catalytic conversion of acetylene to ethylene is reported. The catalyst is a homogeneous molecular cobaloxime that operates in tandem with a photosensitizer at room temperature and bypasses the use of non&#8208;environmentally friendly and flammable H2 gas feed. The reaction proceeds through a cobalt&#8208;hydride intermediate with &#8776;100% conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co&#8208;feed) conditions after only 50 min, and with no evolution of H2 or over&#8208;hydrogenation to ethane. The cobaloxime is further incorporated as a linker in a metal&#8211;organic framework; the result is a heterogeneous catalyst for the conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co&#8208;feed) conditions that can be recycled up to six times and remains catalytically active for 48 h, before significant loss of performance is observed.

         <title>Unlocking Topological Effects in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three fully conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinct topologies are designed and synthesized for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. The topological effects play a crucial role in regulating the charge carrier dynamics in COFs. The hxl topology significantly enhances charge separation and transport, achieving an unprecedented 1.41% efficiency for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic H2O2 production in COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a compelling platform for the efficient photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Constructed with diverse topologies from various molecular building units, COFs can exhibit unique photocatalytic properties. In this study, three &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinctly different topologies (hcb, sql, and hxl) are designed to investigate the topological effect on the overall photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen. Despite their similar chemical and band structures, the QP&#8208;HPTP&#8208;COF with hxl topology outperformed other COFs in the photosynthesis of H2O2, demonstrating a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.41%. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed that the hxl topology can substantially improve charge separation and transfer, thereby significantly enhancing photocatalytic performance. This study not only unravels the topology&#8208;directed charge carrier dynamics in COFs but also establishes a molecular engineering framework for developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)&#8208;Inspired Fully Printed Soft Pressure Sensor Array with Self&#8208;Adaptive Pressurization for Highly Reliable Individualized Long&#8208;Term Pulse Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system to enable 3D reconstruction of the pulse.








Abstract
Reliable, non&#8208;invasive, continuous monitoring of pulse and blood pressure is essential for the prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, the pulse wave varies drastically among individuals or even over time in the same individual, presenting significant challenges for the existing pulse sensing systems. Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system can identify the optimal pulse signal. Besides the detected pulse rate/width/length, &#8220;Cun, Guan, Chi&#8221; position, and &#8220;floating, moderate, sinking&#8221; pulse features, the PSP combined with a machine learning&#8208;based linear regression model can also accurately predict blood pressure such as systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure values. The developed diagnostic platform is demonstrated for highly reliable long&#8208;term monitoring and analysis of pulse and blood pressure across multiple human subjects over time. The design concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept demonstrations also pave the way for the future developments of flexible sensing devices/systems for adaptive individualized monitoring in the complex practical environments for personalized medicine, along with the support for the development of digital TCM.

         <title>Standing 1D Chains Enable Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Selenium Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;heating strategy is adopted to facilitate the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate, enabling the growth of Se films with a vertical orientation. The resulting Se films exhibit a 4&#8208;times increase in carrier mobility compared to horizontally&#8208;oriented Se films. Solar cells fabricated using these Se films achieve a record efficiency of 8.1%.








Abstract
The recent surge in tandem solar cells and indoor photovoltaics has renewed interest in selenium (Se), the world's first photovoltaic material, due to its intrinsic wide bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV, high stability, and non&#8208;toxicity in small quantities when applied in photovoltaics. However, with a 1D chained crystal structure, Se tends to grow crystalline films with a lying orientation&#8212;chains parallel to substrates arising from the low surface energy; this results in poor carrier transport across chains held together by weak van der Waals forces. Here a substrate&#8208;heating strategy that facilitates the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate is introduced, enabling the growth of Se films with a standing orientation&#8212;chains perpendicular to substrates. This achieves efficient carrier transport along covalently bonded chains. The resulting Se films thereby exhibit a fourfold increase in carrier mobility compared to lying&#8208;oriented Se films. Consequently, Se solar cells are achieved with the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.1% under AM1.5G 1&#8208;sun illumination. The unencapsulated devices exhibit negligible efficiency loss after 1&#160;000 h of storage under ambient conditions.

         <title>Transcytosable and Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Liposome Enables Deep Penetration of Biofilm for Surgical Site Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascular&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1)&#8208;targeted and ultrasound&#8208;activated liposome (ligand&#8208;modified, perfluoropentane&#8208;encapsulated, and dual Ce6 and OTM&#8208;integrated liposome) is capable of overcoming the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection. VCAM1&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic&#8208;cavitation&#8208;induced EPS collapse consecutively achieve efficient drug accumulation and deep penetration, then lead to potent biofilm eradication.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection (BSSI) is a common and grievous postoperative complication lacking effective remedies, mainly due to the poor drug accumulation and penetration in the biofilms featured by dense extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Here, it is found that the vascular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1) is highly overexpressed in the vascular cells of BSSI. It is proposed that the combination of VCAM1&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation can consecutively overcome the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and EPS for biofilm eradication. To demonstrate the feasibility, a VCAM1&#8208;targeted and ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated liposome (LPCOTML) loaded with a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive lipoid prodrug of oleoyl meropenem, sonosensitizer of lipoid Ce6, and perfluoropentane is developed. LPCOTML can recognize the receptors on vascular cells, and initiate receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis for transendothelial transport into the BSSI periphery. LPCOTML subsequently transforms from nanoparticle into microbubble via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition under US irradiation, triggering strong ultrasonic cavitation to blow up the EPS and deeply penetrate the biofilms. The sonosensitizer Ce6 induces ROS production under US irradiation and triggers the release of meropenem to induce potent antibacterial effect in a BSSI model. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the biological barriers in BSSI via combining receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Empowered Customized Chiral Metasurface for Calibration&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a deep learning&#8208;driven data iteration strategy alongside a global optimization network, showcasing excellent capabilities in expediting metasurface design and unearthing complex light&#8208;matter interactions. As anticipated, it enables the customized and easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement design of chiral metasurfaces and advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples in a calibration&#8208;free manner.








Abstract
As a 2D metamaterial, metasurfaces offer an unprecedented avenue to facilitate light&#8208;matter interactions. The current &#8220;one&#8208;by&#8208;one design&#8221; method is hindered by time&#8208;consuming, repeated testing within a confined space. However, intelligent design strategies for metasurfaces, limited by data&#8208;driven properties, have rarely been explored. To address this gap, a data iterative strategy based on deep learning, coupled with a global optimization network is proposed, to achieve the customized design of chiral metasurfaces. This methodology is applied to precisely identify different chiral molecules in a label&#8208;free manner. Fundamentally different from the traditional approach of collecting data purely through simulation, the proposed data generation strategy encompasses the entire design space, which is inaccessible by conventional methods. The dataset quality is significantly improved, with a 21&#8208;fold increase in the number of chiral structures exhibiting the desired circular dichroism (CD) response (&gt;0.6). The method's efficacy is validated by a monolayer structure that is easily prepared, demonstrating advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples. These results demonstrate the superior capability of data&#8208;driven schemes in photonic design and the potential of chiral metasurface&#8208;based platforms for calibration&#8208;free biosensing applications. The proposed approach will accelerate the development of complex systems for rapid molecular detection, spectroscopic imaging, and other applications.

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells With Full Lifecycle Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;step air&#8208;processed efficient PSCs with full lifecycle management are effectively realized by the polymer&#8208;stabilized precursor ink. The modified PSCs deliver an impressive efficiency of 25.18% with superior environmental and mechanical stability. The end&#8208;of&#8208;life PSCs with lead leakage suppression and device regeneration will not pose a threat to the environmental and biological safety.








Abstract
Despite the outstanding power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) realized over the years, the entire lifecycle from preparation and operation to discarding of PSCs still needs to be carefully considered when it faces the upcoming large&#8208;scale production and deployment. In this study, bio&#8208;derived chitin&#8208;based polymers are employed to realize the full lifecycle regulation of air&#8208;processed PSCs by forming multiple coordinated and hydrogen bonds to stabilize the lead iodide and organic salt precursor inks, accelerating the solid&#8211;liquid reaction and crystallization of two&#8208;step deposition process, then achieving the high crystalline and oriented perovskites with less notorious charge defects in the open air.

&lt;p&gt;The two-step air-processed efficient PSCs with full lifecycle management are effectively realized by the polymer-stabilized precursor ink. The modified PSCs deliver an impressive efficiency of 25.18% with superior environmental and mechanical stability. The end-of-life PSCs with lead leakage suppression and device regeneration will not pose a threat to the environmental and biological safety.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the outstanding power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) realized over the years, the entire lifecycle from preparation and operation to discarding of PSCs still needs to be carefully considered when it faces the upcoming large-scale production and deployment. In this study, bio-derived chitin-based polymers are employed to realize the full lifecycle regulation of air-processed PSCs by forming multiple coordinated and hydrogen bonds to stabilize the lead iodide and organic salt precursor inks, accelerating the solid&#8211;liquid reaction and crystallization of two-step deposition process, then achieving the high crystalline and oriented perovskites with less notorious charge defects in the open air. The air-prepared PSCs exhibit a decent efficiency of 25.18% with high preparation reproducibility and improved operational stability toward the harsh environment and mechanical stress stimuli. The modified PSCs display negligible fatigue behavior with keeping 92% of its initial efficiency after operating for 32 diurnal cycles (ISOS-LC-1 protocol). Meanwhile, closed-loop lead management of end-of-life PSCs including suppression of lead leakage, toxicity evaluation of broken devices, and recycling of lead iodide components are comprehensively investigated. This work sheds light on a promising avenue to realize the entire lifecycle regulation of air-processed efficient and stable PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x significantly lowers the formation energy of sulfur vacancies in ZnIn2S4, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich surface within the ZnIn2S4/MoO3&#8208;x photocatalyst. This enhances CO2 adsorption and activation, reduces the energy barrier for HCOO* formation, and promotes efficient *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling. Consequently, the system achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 92.0%.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products, increasing the number of CO2 adsorption sites and lowering the energy barriers for key intermediates are critical. A ZnIn2S4 (ZIS)/MoO3&#8208;x (Z&#8208;M) photocatalyst is presented, in which plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x generates hot electrons, creating a multielectron environment in ZIS that facilitates efficient C&#9472;C coupling reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MoO3&#8208;x reduces the formation energy of sulfur vacancies (SV) in ZIS, thereby enhancing CO2 adsorption and activation. The SV&#8208;rich surface lowers the energy barrier for forming HCOO* to &#8722;0.33 eV whereas the energy barrier for forming *COOH is 0.77 eV. Successive hydrogenation of HCOO* leads to *CH2, which converts to *CH3 with an energy barrier of &#8722;0.63 eV. The energy barrier for *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling is 0.54 eV, which is lower than the 0.73 eV for *CH2&#8208;CH2 coupling to form *C2H4. Thus, Z&#8208;M preferentially produces C2H6 over C2H4. Under visible light, Z&#8208;M achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 92.0% selectivity. This work highlights the dual role of plasmonic photocatalysts in enhancing CO2 adsorption and improving C2+ production in CO2 reduction.

Tissue Adhesives
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, such as scotch tape, demonstrate adhesion limited to dry substrates. By integrating the interfacial behavior of hydrogels, Yuhan Lee, Hyunwoo Yuk, Seongjun Park, and co&#8208;workers have synthesized a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive capable of instant and repositionable adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the lungs. This class of adhesives exhibits potential utility in on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios, including fault&#8208;tolerant integration of surgical tools and sensors. More details can be found in article number 2407116.

Superhydrophobic Concave Pillar
In article number 2409389, Dong Woog Lee and co&#8208;workers report a stable superhydrophobic surface achieved through a novel concave morphology design. The concave pillar structures enhance resistance to wetting transitions under both impact and hydrostatic pressure. The air trapped in the concavities during water contact plays a crucial role in maintaining stable superhydrophobicity by forming a convex air cap.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Superhydrophobic Concave Pillar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202409389"&gt;2409389&lt;/a&gt;, Dong Woog Lee and co-workers report a stable superhydrophobic surface achieved through a novel concave morphology design. The concave pillar structures enhance resistance to wetting transitions under both impact and hydrostatic pressure. The air trapped in the concavities during water contact plays a crucial role in maintaining stable superhydrophobicity by forming a convex air cap.

Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels
In article number 2412502 by &#381;eljko Tomovi&#263; and co&#8208;workers, a simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT) aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and paraformaldehyde. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.

Piezoelectric Heterojunctions
Heterojunctions, made of piezoelectric nanocrystals and nanowires, can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat to kill bacteria under the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared light. These heterojunctions produce electric signals under the forces applied by the stem cells grown on them and such electric signals further promote bone formation. Hence, they can not only achieve osteointegration but also eradicate implant&#8208;associated infections. More details can be found in article number 2413171 by Chengyun Ning, Peng Yu, Chuanbin Mao, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>The Development, Essence and Perspective of Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper summarizes the development of six milestones of nitrogen reduction to ammonia, and concludes its commonalities and characteristics. Accordingly, the essence of ammonia synthesis is extracted, that is the reaction pathways are influenced by the energy barrier of reaction intrmediates, which can be altered by proton sources, auxiliaries and catalysts, providing design guidance for efficient ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Ammonia plays a pivotal role in agriculture and meanwhile holds promising potential as an energy vector for the hydrogen economy, where the nitrogen reduction to ammonia is a critical pathway for achieving sustainable development. Over the past hundred years, ammonia synthesis has undergone several breakthrough developments from Haber&#8208;Bosch process to photo/electro&#8208;catalysis and Li&#8208;mediated strategy, but still faces the challenges of low yield rate, selectivity and efficiency. Therefore, there is a pressing demand to develop efficient and green ammonia synthesis from nitrogen. This review summarizes the development of the nitrogen reduction to ammonia, highlighting six milestones during the whole journey. From the development direction, this work finds and extracts the essence of ammonia synthesis, that is the reaction pathways are affected by the energy barrier of reaction intermediates, which can be altered by proton sources, auxiliaries and catalysts. Then this work discusses the detailed overview of the significant development of proton source, auxiliaries and catalysts. Finally, based on the essence, the possible opportunities of ammonia synthesis from nitrogen reduction are presented, including the design of new ammonia synthesis pathways and efficient catalysts. The deep insight of nitrogen reduction to ammonia will provide a design guidance for efficient ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Catalytic Biomaterials&#8208;Activated In Situ Chemical Reactions: Strategic Modulation and Enhanced Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the modulation of fundamental catalytic reactions, a cornerstone in addressing disease treatment through an interdisciplinary lens. Central to this review's discussion is the regulation of chemical reactions while concurrently accounting for the complex microenvironments of diseases to achieve specificity, efficiency, and control of in situ chemical reactions. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials activated in situ chemical reactions and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.








Abstract
Chemical reactions underpin biological processes, and imbalances in critical biochemical pathways within organisms can lead to the onset of severe diseases. Within this context, the emerging field of &#8220;Nanocatalytic Medicine&#8221; leverages nanomaterials as catalysts to modulate fundamental chemical reactions specific to the microenvironments of diseases. This approach is designed to facilitate the targeted synthesis and localized accumulation of therapeutic agents, thus enhancing treatment efficacy and precision while simultaneously reducing systemic side effects. The effectiveness of these nanocatalytic strategies critically hinges on a profound understanding of chemical kinetics and the intricate interplay of reactions within particular pathological microenvironments to ensure targeted and effective catalytic actions. This review methodically explores in situ catalytic reactions and their associated biomaterials, emphasizing regulatory strategies that control therapeutic responses. Furthermore, the discussion encapsulates the crucial elements&#8208;reactants, catalysts, and reaction conditions/environments&#8208;necessary for optimizing the thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions, while rigorously addressing both the biochemical and biophysical dimensions of the disease microenvironments to enhance therapeutic outcomes. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.

         <title>Synthesis Strategies for High Entropy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for high entropy materials nanoparticles preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) of high entropy materials (HEMs) have attracted significant attention due to their versatility and wide range of applications. HEM NPs can be synthesized by fragmenting bulk HEMs or disintegrating and recrystallizing them. Alternatively, directly producing HEMs in NP form from atomic/ionic/molecular precursors presents a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy involves thermodynamically driving HEM NP formation by leveraging the entropic contribution but incorporating strategies to limit NP growth at the elevated temperatures used for maximizing entropy. A second approach is to kinetically drive HEM NP formation by promoting rapid reactions of homogeneous reactant mixtures or using highly diluted precursor dissolutions. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that enthalpy plays a significant role in driving HEM NP formation processes at moderate temperatures, with the high energy cost of generating additional surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale stabilizing the HEM phase. This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for HEM NP preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms. Such insights are critical for fine&#8208;tuning experimental conditions to achieve specific outcomes, ultimately enabling the effective synthesis of optimized generations of these advanced materials for both current and emerging applications across various scientific and technological fields.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with electronegative atoms (O/N/F)&#8208;containing functional groups facilitate the optimization of the electron distribution around them, which endows the facile optimization of the interaction strength between the positively charged and negatively charged species, leading to desired thermal and kinetical optimal states, and thus benefiting the stabilization of the Zn anode for potential flexible devices.








Abstract
The rapid development of wearable and intelligent flexible devices has posed strict requirements for power sources, including excellent mechanical strength, inherent safety, high energy density, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Zn&#8208;ion batteries with aqueous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (AQSSEs) with various functional groups that contain electronegative atoms (O/N/F) with tunable electron accumulation states are considered as a promising candidate to power the flexible devices and tremendous progress has been achieved in this prospering area. Herein, this review proposes a comprehensive summary of the recent achievements using the AQSSE in flexible devices by focusing on the significance of different functional groups. The fundamentals and challenges of the ZIBs are introduced from a chemical view in the first place. Then, the mechanism behind the stabilization of the flexible ZIBs with the functionalized AQSSE is summarized and explained in detail. Then the recent progress regarding the enhanced electrochemical stability of the ZIBs with the AQSSE is summarized and classified based on the functional groups on the polymer chain. The advanced characterization methods for the AQSSE are briefly introduced in the following sections. Last but not least, current challenges and future perspectives for this promising area are provided from the authors' point of view.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in design strategies for synthesizing solution&#8208;processable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF&#8208;based systems, including methods such as direct dispersion in ionic liquids, direct synthesis, etc. It emphasizes their applications in fabricating structured objects, membranes, and/or films for molecular storage, separation, and chemical sensing. The review also discusses future challenges and perspectives. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by inorganic secondary building units with organic linkers via reticular chemistry, inherently suffer from poor solution processability due to their insoluble nature, resulting from their extensive crystalline networks and structural rigidity. The ubiquitous occurrence of precipitation and agglomeration of MOFs upon formation poses a significant obstacle to the scale&#8208;up production of MOF&#8208;based monolith, aerogels, membranes, and electronic devices, thus restricting their practical applications in various scenarios. To address the previously mentioned challenge, significant strides have been achieved over the past decade in the development of various strategies aimed at preparing solution&#8208;processable MOF systems. In this review, the latest advance in the synthetic strategies for the construction of solution&#8208;processable MOFs, including direct dispersion in ionic liquids, surface modification, controllable calcination, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis, is comprehensively summarized. The respective advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Additionally, the intriguing applications of solution&#8208;processable MOF systems in the fields of liquid adsorbent, molecular capture, sensing, and separation are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities about the continued advancement of solution&#8208;processable MOFs and their potential applications are outlooked.

This review demonstrates the properties of HEMs both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the mechanisms of their enhancement on battery properties. It also illustrates the progress in high&#8208;entropy layered oxide cathode materials (HELOs) for lithium/sodium/potassium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/PIBs) in the perspectives of synthesis, characterization and application, and elucidating the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationship.








Abstract
Increasing demand for rechargeable batteries necessitates improvements in electrochemical performance. Traditional optimal approaches such as elemental doping and surface modification are insufficient for practical applications of the batteries. High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) possess stable solid&#8208;state phases and unparalleled flexibility in composition and electronic structure, which facilitate rapid advancements in battery materials. This review demonstrates the properties of HEMs both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the mechanisms of their enhancement on battery properties. It also illustrates the progress in high&#8208;entropy layered oxide cathode materials (HELOs) for lithium/sodium/potassium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/PIBs) in the perspectives of synthesis, characterization and application, and elucidating the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationship. Furthermore, it outlines future directions for high&#8208;entropy strategies in battery study: precise synthesis control, understanding of reaction mechanisms through structural characterization, elucidation of structure&#8208;performance correlations, and the computational and experimental methods integration for rapid screening and analysis of HEMs. The perspective aims to inspire researchers in the development of high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Polarization: A Universal Driving Force for Energy, Environment, and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization techniques are revolutionizing material functionalities across energy, environmental, and electronic sectors. This review comprehensively examines polarization mechanisms such as piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric effects, alongside strategies like doping and heterostructures. It highlights its pivotal role in enhancing charge dynamics, modifying surface chemistries, and facilitating energy&#8208;efficient designs in various applications.








Abstract
The sustainable future relies on the synergistic development of energy, environmental, and electronic systems, founded on the development of functional materials by exploring their quantum mechanisms. Effective control over the distribution and behavior of charges within these materials, a basic quantum attribute, is crucial in dictating their physical, chemical, and electronic properties. At the core of charge manipulation lies &#8220;polarization&#8221;&#8212;a ubiquitous phenomenon marked by separating positive and negative charges. This review thoroughly examines polarization techniques, spotlighting their transformative role in catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, and electronics. Starting with the foundational mechanisms underlying various forms of polarization, including piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric effects, the perspective is expanded to cover any asymmetric phenomena that generate internal fields, such as heterostructures and doping. Afterward, the critical role of polarization across various applications, including charge separation, surface chemistry modification, and energy band alignment, is highlighted. Special emphasis is placed on the synergy between polarization and material properties, demonstrating how this interplay is pivotal in overcoming existing technological limitations and unlocking new functionalities. Through a comprehensive analysis, a holistic roadmap is offered for harnessing polarization across the broad spectrum of applications, thus finding sustainable solutions for future energy, environment, and electronics.

         <title>Recent Advances in High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>

The basic concepts, design principles, synthetic methods, advanced characterization, and theoretical calculations of high&#8208;entropy layered oxides are summarized here for alkali metal&#8208;ion battery (AMIB) cathodes. It highlights the recent advances in high&#8208;entropy strategies for improving the electrochemical performance of layered oxide cathodes, and existing problems and possible solutions, providing guidance for the development of layered oxides for highly efficient AMIB cathodes.








Abstract
Since the electrochemical de/intercalation behavior is first detected in 1980, layered oxides have become the most promising cathode material for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (Li+/Na+/K+; AMIBs) owing to their facile synthesis and excellent theoretical capacities. However, the inherent drawbacks of unstable structural evolution and sluggish diffusion kinetics deteriorate their electrochemical performance, limiting further large&#8208;scale applications. To solve these issues, the novel and promising strategy of high entropy has been widely applied to layered oxide cathodes for AMIBs in recent years. Through multielement synergy and entropy stabilization effects, high&#8208;entropy layered oxides (HELOs) can achieve adjustable activity and enhanced stability. Herein, the basic concepts, design principles, and synthesis methods of HELO cathodes are introduced systematically. Notably, it explores in detail the improvements of the high&#8208;entropy strategy on the limitations of layered oxides, highlighting the latest advances in high&#8208;entropy layered cathode materials in the field of AMIBs. In addition, it introduces advanced characterization and theoretical calculations for HELOs and proposes potential future research directions and optimization strategies, providing inspiration for researchers to develop advanced HELO cathode materials in the areas of energy storage and conversion.
