         <title>Emerging Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal Oxides: From Synthesis to Device Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal oxides have aroused increasing attention in the field of electronics and optoelectronics due to their intriguing physical properties. In this review paper, an overview of recent advances on synthesis of 2D metal oxides and their electronic applications is presented. First, the tunable physical properties of 2D metal oxides that related to the structure (various oxidation&#8208;state forms, polymorphism, etc.), crystalline and defects (anisotropy, point defects, and grain boundary), and thickness (quantum confinement effect, interfacial effect, etc.) are discussed. Then, advanced synthesis method for 2D metal oxides besides mechanical exfoliation are introduced and classified into solution process, vapor phase deposition, and native oxidation on metal source. Later, the various roles of 2D metal oxides in widespread applications, i.e., transistors, inverters, photodetectors, piezotronics, memristors, and potential applications (solar cell, spintronics and superconducting devices) are discussed. Finally, the outlook of existing challenges and future opportunities in 2D metal oxides are proposed.

         <title>Highly Efficient Flexocatalysis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Catalysis is vitally important for chemical engineering, energy and environment. It is critical to discover new mechanisms for efficient catalysis. For piezoelectric/pyroelectric/ferroelectric materials that have a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure, interfacial polarization induced redox reactions at surfaces leads to advanced mechanocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate the first flexocatalysis for two&#8208;dimensional centrosymmetric semiconductors, such as MnO2 nanosheets, largely expanding the polarization&#8208;based&#8208;mechanocatalysis to two&#8208;dimensional centrosymmetric materials. Under ultrasonic excitation, the reactive species are created due to the strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric polarization in MnO2 nanosheets composed nanoflowers. The organic pollutants (MB et&#160;al.) can be effectively degraded within 5 minutes, the performance of the flexocatalysis is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezocatalysis, with excellent stability and reproducibility. Moreover, the factors related to flexocatalysis such as material morphology, adsorption, mechanical vibration intensity, and temperature are explored, which give deep insights into the mechanocatalysis. This study opens the field of flexoelectric effect based mechanochemistry in two&#8208;dimensional centrosymmetric semiconductors.

         <title>Unraveling the Stretch&#8208;induced Microstructural Evolution and Morphology&#8208;Stretchability Relationships of High&#8208;Performance Ternary Organic Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The stretchability and stretch&#8208;induced structural evolution of organic solar cells (OSCs) are pivotal for their collapsible, portable, and wearable applications, and they are mainly affected by the complex morphology of active layers. Herein, a highly ductile conjugated polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) was incorporated into the active layers of high&#8208;efficiency OSCs based on nonfullerene small molecule acceptors to simultaneously investigate the morphological, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties and structural evolution under stretching of ternary blend films with various acceptor contents. The structural robustness of the blend films was indicated by their stretch&#8208;induced structural evolution, which was monitored in real&#8208;time by a combination of in&#8208;situ wide/small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. We found that adding the soft P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) can enhance the stretchability and structural robustness of ternary blend films by increasing entangled chains and tie chains to dissipate strain. Furthermore, the stretchability of the ternary blends can be superbly predicted by the three&#8208;dimensional equivalent box model. This work provides instructive insight and guidance for designing stretchable electronics and predicting the stretchability of multi&#8208;component blends.

         <title>Tailoring Poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic anhydride) Networks for All&#8208;Polymer Dielectrics Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8208;Discharge Efficiency at Elevated Temperatures</title>

Abstract
Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8208;discharge speed and great stability. However, the exponential increase of electrical conduction with temperature and applied electric field substantially degrades the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures. Here, we report the first example of controlling the energy level of charge traps in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymers by tailoring molecular structures that significantly inhibit high&#8208;field high&#8208;temperature conduction loss, which largely differs from current approaches based on introducion of inorganic fillers. The polymer network with optimized crosslinking strutures exhibits an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 7.02&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3 with charge/discharge efficiencies &gt; 90% at 150&#176;C, far outperforming current dielectric polymers and composites. The charge trapping effects in different crosslinked structures, as the origins of the marked improvements in the high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, have been comprehensively investigated experimentally and confirmed computationally. Moreover, excellent cyclability and self&#8208;healing feature have been demonstrated in the polymer film capacitors. This work offers a promising pathway of molecular structure design to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics capable of operating under harsh environments.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Lasers Featuring Sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton Threshold and Very High Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The use of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as a gain medium in infrared laser devices has been underpinned by the need for high pumping intensities, very short gain lifetimes and low gain coefficients. Here, we employ PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell CQDs as an infrared gain medium that results in highly suppressed Auger recombination with a lifetime of 485&#160;ps, lowering the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 300 &#956;J.cm&#8722;2, and showing a record high net modal gain coefficient of 2180 cm&#8722;1. By doping these engineered core/shell CQDs up to nearly filling the first excited state, we demonstrate a significant reduction of optical gain threshold, measured by transient absorption, to an average&#8211;exciton population per dot &#12296;Nth&#12297;g of 0.45 due to bleaching of the ground state absorption. This in turn have led us to attain a 5&#8208;fold reduction in ASE threshold at &#12296;Nth&#12297;ASE= 0.70 excitons per dot, associated with a gain lifetime of 280&#160;ps. Finally, we use these heterostructured QDs to achieve near&#8208;infrared lasing at 1670&#160;nm at a pump fluences corresponding to sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton per dot threshold (&#12296;Nth&#12297;Las = 0.87). This work brings infrared CQD lasing thresholds on par to their visible counterparts, albeit starting with an 8&#8208;fold degenerate system and paves the way towards solution processed infrared laser diodes.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal Free Spintronic System with Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Ferromagnetic Topological Surface State of FeSi Above Room Temperature</title>

Abstract
Strongly spin&#8208;orbit coupled states at metal interfaces, topological insulators and two&#8208;dimensional materials enable efficient electric control of spin states, offering great potential for spintronics. However, there are still materials challenges to overcome, including the integration into advanced silicon electronics and the scarce resources of constituent heavy elements of those materials. Through magneto&#8208;transport measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations, here we demonstrate robust spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC)&#8208;induced properties of a ferromagnetic topological surface state in FeSi and their controllability via hybridization with adjacent materials. In comparison to the case of its naturally oxidized surface, the ferromagnetic transition temperature is greatly increased beyond room temperature and the effective SOC strength is almost doubled at the surface in proximity to a wide&#8208;bandgap fluoride insulator. Those enhanced magnetic properties enable room&#8208;temperature magnetization switching, being applicable to spin&#8208;orbit torque based spintronic devices. Realization of strong SOC in the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free silicon&#8208;based compound will accelerate spintronic applications.

         <title>Oxygen Evolution Activity of Amorphous Cobalt Oxyhydroxides: Interconnecting Precatalyst Reconstruction, Long&#8208;Range Order, Buffer&#8208;Binding, Morphology, Mass Transport, and Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four different amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides and two crystalline cobalt oxides are studied in&#160;situ to deduce the role of the reconstruction conditions, the effect of the electrolyte, and structure&#8211;activity relations for near&#8208;neutral water oxidation. Multiple aspects are considered and interconnected, deducing a comprehensive concept for the different electrocatalytic performances, including mass transport.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline or amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides (CoCat) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While having the same short&#8208;range order, CoCat phases possess different electrocatalytic properties. This phenomenon is not conclusively understood, as multiple interdependent parameters affect the OER activity simultaneously. Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2O)2[B2P2O8(OH)2]&#183;H2O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrode substrate to catalyst interface. Ex situ and in situ investigations of the two borophosphate derived CoCats, as well as the prominent CoPi and CoBi identify differences in the Tafel slope/range, buffer binding and content, long&#8208;range order, number of accessible edge sites, redox activity, and morphology. Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass&#8208;transport limitations, a comprehensive picture is provided explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bonded buffers, and the morphology. With this acquired knowledge, an optimized OER system is realized operating in near&#8208;neutral potassium borate medium at 1.62&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;VRHE yielding 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 65&#160;&#176;C for 1&#160;month without degrading performance.

         <title>Machine Learning for Optical Scanning Probe Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three main paradigms of machine learning&#8212;supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning&#8212;can be applied to optical scanning probe techniques in future instrumentation and data analysis to solve unique problems.








Abstract
The ability to perform nanometer&#8208;scale optical imaging and spectroscopy is key to deciphering the low&#8208;energy effects in quantum materials, as well as vibrational fingerprints in planetary and extraterrestrial particles, catalytic substances, and aqueous biological samples. These tasks can be accomplished by the scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy (s&#8208;SNOM) technique that has recently spread to many research fields and enabled notable discoveries. Herein, it is shown that the s&#8208;SNOM, together with scanning probe research in general, can benefit in many ways from artificial&#8208;intelligence (AI) and machine&#8208;learning (ML) algorithms. Augmented with AI&#8208; and ML&#8208;enhanced data acquisition and analysis, scanning probe optical nanoscopy is poised to become more efficient, accurate, and intelligent.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable, Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Polymer Donors Featuring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Spacers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are developed by designing a new series of polymer donors (PDs, PhAm) featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;capable flexible spacers. High power conversion efficiency (PCE = 12.7%) and stretchability (PCE retention of &gt; 80% at 32% strain) are demonstrated, which represent the best performances in terms of both PCE and stretchability among the IS&#8208;OSCs reported to date.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), consisting of all stretchable layers, are attracting significant attention as a future power source for wearable electronics. However, most of the efficient active layers for OSCs are mechanically brittle due to their rigid molecular structures designed for high electrical and optical properties. Here, a series of new polymer donors (PDs, PhAmX) featuring phenyl amide (N1,N3&#8208;bis((5&#8208;bromothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)isophthalamide, PhAm)&#8208;based flexible spacer (FS) inducing hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions is developed. These PDs enable IS&#8208;OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.73% and excellent stretchability (PCE retention of &gt;80% of the initial value at 32% strain), representing the best performances among the reported IS&#8208;OSCs to date. The incorporation of PhAm&#8208;based FS enhances the molecular ordering of PDs as well as their interactions with a Y7 acceptor, enhancing the mechanical stretchability and electrical properties simultaneously. It is also found that in rigid OSCs, the PhAm5:Y7 blend achieves a much higher PCE of 17.5% compared to that of the reference PM6:Y7 blend. The impact of the PhAm&#8208;FS linker on the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of OSCs is thoroughly investigated.

         <title>An Implantable Magnetic Vascular Scaffold for Circulating Tumor Cell Removal In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a new type of vascular&#8208;like ITD with artificial adhesion repertoires and a wireless magnetothermal response for high metastatic circulating tumor cell removal in vivo is proposed. The ITD implanted in the artery mainly comprises PLLA fibers encapsulated with FeCo@G and a 3D structure with HA and gelatin for the preparation of bioinspired adhesive sites.








Abstract
An integrated trapped device (ITD) capable of removal of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can assuage or even prevent metastasis. However, adhesion repertoires are ordinarily neglected in the design of ITDs, possibly leading to the omission of highly metastatic CTC and treatment failure. Here a vascular&#8208;like ITD with adhesive sites and wireless magnetothermal response to remove highly metastatic CTC in vivo is presented. Such a vascular&#8208;like ITD comprises circumferential well&#8208;aligned fibers and artificial adhesion repertoires and is optimized for magnetothermal integration. Continuous and repeated capture in a dynamic environment increases capture efficiency over time. Meanwhile, the heat generation of the ITD leads to the capture of CTC death owing to cell heat sensitivity. Furthermore, the constructed bioinspired ultrastructure of the ITD prevents vascular blockage and induces potential vascular regeneration. Overall, this work defines an extendable strategy for constructing adhesion repertoires against intravascular shear forces, provides a vascular&#8208;like ITD for reducing CTC counts, and is expected to alleviate the risk of cancer recurrence.

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Decorated Nanostructure for Precision Sonodynamic&#8208;Catalytic Therapy of MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable nanostructure is developed and assessed for outstanding biofilm disruption effect by capturing bacteria and penetrating biofilm matrix of guanidinium, and the synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic effect. The remotely controlled nanostructure efficiently clears infection and mediates the inflammation resolution in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;infected osteomyelitis, thus providing a novel sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy for osteomyelitis.








Abstract
Osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm infection is difficult to eradicate and can even be life&#8208;threatening. Given that the infection is persistent and deep&#8208;seated in the bone tissue, controlled and efficient treatment of osteomyelitis remains challenging. Herein, an activatable nanostructure (Au/TNT@PG) is presented for synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy of MRSA&#8208;infected osteomyelitis. The Au/TNT@PG backbone is obtained by conjugating a guanidinium&#8208;rich polymer (PG), a component that penetrates the biofilm matrix, onto ultrasound (US)&#8208;absorbing gold&#8208;doped titanate nanotubes (Au/TNTs). Under deep&#8208;penetrating US irradiation, the nanocomposite generates 1O2 for sonodynamic therapy and catalyzes the decomposition of endogenous H2O2 into toxic &#8226;OH in the acidic infection microenvironment for catalytic therapy, leading to bacterial cell death. Its robust antibacterial effectiveness is attributable to its bacteria&#8208;capturing ability, the biofilm penetrability of positively charged guanidinium, and the subsequent synergistic effect of sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic action of Au/TNT. Such a remotely controlled approach potentiates the polarization of macrophages to M2&#8208;type while suppressing the M1&#8208;type, leading to topical inflammation resolution and enhanced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation to inhibit bone loss. Therefore, this study provides a generic nanotherapeutic approach for efficient sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy with respect to osteomyelitis.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Fully Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Capacity and Ultrastable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the fast synthesis of fully conjugated phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The as&#8208;prepared COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries with the achievement of a high reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;due to their good conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature.








Abstract
Fully aromatic conjugated covalent organic frameworks (FAC&#8208;COFs) with excellent physicochemical stability have been emerging as active semiconductors for diverse potential applications. Developing efficient synthesis methods for fabricating FAC&#8208;COFs will significantly facilitate the exploration over their material and photonic/electronic functionalities. Herein, a facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D phthalocyanine&#8208;based FAC&#8208;COFs (FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs). Cyclopolymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]bis[1,4]benzodioxin&#8208;2,3,9,10&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (BBTC) and quinoxalino[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:9,10]phenanthro[4,5&#8208;abc]phenazine&#8208;6,7,15,16&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (QPPTC) in ZnCl2&#160;leads to the fast formation and isolation of BB&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF and QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF, respectively. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy analysis reveal their crystalline nature with sql topology and AA stacking configuration. Thermogravimetric analysis and immersion experiment indicate their excellent stability. The conductivity test demonstrates their high conductivity of 0.93&#8211;1.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;owing to the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structural nature. In particular, the as&#8208;prepared FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their excellent conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature. Impressively, QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF shows a large reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 100&#160;cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a capacity retention of nearly 100% at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;for over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles.

         <title>P&#8208;mediated Cu&#8208;N4 sites in carbon nitride realizing CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 with selectivity modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high value&#8208;added C2 products (e.g., C2H4) is of considerable interest but challenging. The C2H4 product selectivity strongly hinges on the intermediate energy levels in the CO2 reduction pathway. Herein, we design the Cu&#8208;N4 sites anchored phosphorus&#8208;modulated carbon nitride (CuACs/PCN) as the photocatalyst to tailor the intermediate energy levels in the C2H4 formation reaction pathway for realizing its high production with tunable selectivity. Theoretical calculations combined with experimental data demonstrate that the formation of the C&#8722;C coupling intermediates can be realized on Cu&#8208;N4 sites and the surrounding doped P facilitate the production of C2H4. Thus, CuACs/PCN exhibits a high C2H4 selectivity of 53.2% with a yielding rate of 30.51 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1. The findings reveal the significant role of the coordination environment and surrounding microenvironment of Cu single atoms in C2H4 formation and offer an effective approach for highly selective CO2 photoreduction to produce C2H4.

         <title>A Therapeutic Nanovaccine that Generates Anti&#8208;amyloid Antibodies and Amyloid&#8208;specific Regulatory T cells for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a complex condition characterized by multiple pathophysiological mechanisms including amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaque accumulation and neuroinflammation in the brain. Current immunotherapy approaches, such as anti&#8208;A&#946; monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, A&#946; vaccines, and adoptive regulatory T (Treg) cell transfer target a single pathophysiological mechanism that may lead to unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, A&#946; vaccines often induce T helper 1 (Th1) cell&#8208;mediated inflammatory responses. Here, we developed a nanovaccine composed of lipid nanoparticles loaded with A&#946; peptides and rapamycin, which targets multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, exhibits the combined effects of anti&#8208;A&#946; antibody therapy and adoptive A&#946;&#8208;specific Treg cell transfer, and can overcome the limitations of current immunotherapy approaches for AD. Nanovaccines effectively deliver rapamycin and A&#946; peptides to dendritic cells, produce both anti&#8208;A&#946; antibodies and A&#946;&#8208;specific Treg cells, remove A&#946; plaques in the brain, alleviate neuroinflammation, prevent Th1 cell&#8208;mediated excessive immune responses, and inhibit cognitive impairment in mice. Nanovaccines show higher&#160;efficacy in cognitive recovery than an A&#946; vaccine. Unlike anti&#8208;A&#946; mAb therapy and adoptive Treg cell transfer, both of which require complicated and costly manufacturing processes, nanovaccines are easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare and cost&#8208;effective. Nanovaccines could represent a novel treatment option for AD.

Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is a layered inorganic synthetic crystal exhibiting high temperature stability and high thermal conductivity. As a ceramic material it has been widely used for thermal management, heat shielding, lubrication, and as a filler material for structural composites. Recent scientific advances in isolating atomically thin monolayers from layered van der Waals crystals to study their unique properties has propelled research interest in mono/few layered h&#8208;BN as a wide bandgap insulating support for nanoscale electronics, tunnel barriers, communications, neutron detectors, optics, sensing, novel separations, quantum emission from defects among others. Realizing these futuristic applications hinges on scalable cost&#8208;effective high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN synthesis. Here, we review scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer h&#8208;BN synthesis, discuss the challenges and opportunities for each method and contextualize their relevance to emerging applications. Maintaining a stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 as the atoms incorporate into the growing layered crystal and maintaining stacking order between layers during multi&#8208;layer synthesis emerge as some of the main challenges for h&#8208;BN synthesis and the development of processes to address these aspects can inform and guide the synthesis of other layered materials with more than one constituent element. Finally, we contextualize h&#8208;BN synthesis efforts along with quality requirements for emerging applications via a technological roadmap.

         <title>A smart &#8220;Energy NanoLock&#8221; selectively blocks oral cancer energy metabolism through synergistic inhibition of exogenous nutrient supply and endogenous energy production</title>

Abstract
The major challenge in oral cancer is lack of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art treatment modality that effectively cures cancer while preserving oral functions. Recent insights into tumor metabolic dependency provide therapeutic opportunity for exploring optimal treatment approaches. Herein, a smart responsive &#8220;Energy NanoLock&#8221; is developed to improve cancer metabolic intervention through simultaneously inhibiting nutrient supply and energy production. NanoLock is a pomegranate&#8208;like nanocomplex of cyclicRGD&#8208;modified carboxymethyl chitosan (CyclicRC, pI = 6.7) encapsulating indocyanine green and apoptotic peptides functionalized gold nanoparticles (IK&#8208;AuNPs), which together form a dual pH&#8208; and photo&#8208;responsive therapeutic platform. NanoLock exhibits good stability under physiological conditions, but releases small&#8208;size CyclicRC and IK&#8208;AuNPs in response to tumor acidic microenvironment, leading to deep tumor penetration. CyclicRC targets integrins to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, and consequently blocks tumor nutrient supply. Meanwhile, IK&#8208;AuNPs specifically induce apoptotic peptides and photothermal mediated mitochondrial collapse, and consequently inhibits endogenous energy production, thereby facilitating cell death. Importantly, in both xenograft and orthotopic oral cancer models, NanoLock selectively eliminates tumor with little cross&#8208;reactivity with normal tissues, especially oral functions, resulting in prolonged survival of mice. Therefore, NanoLock provides a novel metabolic therapy to exploit synergistic inhibition of exogenous nutrient supply and endogenous energy production, which potentially advances oral cancer treatment.

         <title>Manganese Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Cold&#8208;Adapted Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of cold&#8208;adapted enzymes with high efficiency and good stability is an advanced strategy to overcome the limitations of catalytic medicine in low and cryogenic temperatures. In this work, inspired by natural enzymes, we designed and synthesized a novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme based on manganese&#8208;based nanosized metal&#8208;organic framework (nMnBTC). The nMnBTC as oxidase mimetic not only exhibits excellent activity at 0&#176;C, but also presents almost no observable activity loss as the temperature is increased to 45&#176;C. This breaks the traditional recognition that enzymes show maximum activity only under specific psychrophilic or thermophilic condition. The superior performance of nMnBTC as a cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme can be attributed to its high catalytic efficiency at low temperature, good substrate affinity and flexible conformation. Based on the robust performance of nMnBTC, a low&#8208;temperature antiviral strategy is developed to inactivate influenza virus H1N1 even at &#8208;20&#176;C. These results not only provide an important guide for the rational design of highly efficient artificial cold&#8208;adapted enzymes, but also pave a novel way for biomedical application in cryogenic fields.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Boosted Imine Cathodes with Extended Conjugated Structure for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been the spotlight in energy storage owing to their intrinsic safety, fast kinetics, and low cost. In this work, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated structure is in situ injected into layered Ti&#8208;based MXene (Ti3C2Tx) to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. The assembled ZIBs exhibit ultralong cycle stability and display impressive potential for electronic devices.








Abstract
Organic molecules have been considered promising energy&#8208;storage materials in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but are plagued by poor conductivity and structural instability because of the short&#8208;range conjugated structure and low molecular weight. Herein, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated effects along the C&#63742;N backbones is proposed, which is in situ injected into layered MXene to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. Theoretical and electrochemical analyses reveal a selective H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism in TAP, which is ascribed to the steric effect on the availability of active C&#63742;N sites. Moreover, Ti3C2Tx, as a conductive scaffold, favors fast Zn2+ diffusion to boost the electrode kinetics of TAP. Close electronic interactions between TAP and Ti3C2Tx preserve the structural integrity of TAP/Ti3C2Tx during the repeated charge/discharge. Accordingly, the TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 303 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.04 A g&#8722;1 in aqueous ZIBs, which also realizes an ultralong lifetime over 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 81.6%. Furthermore, flexible Zn||TAP/Ti3C2Tx batteries with a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte demonstrate potential application in wearable electronic devices. This work offers pivotal guidance to create highly stable organic electrodes for advanced ZIBs.

         <title>Donor End&#8208;Capped Alkyl Chain Length Dependent Non&#8208;Radiative Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MPhS&#8208;C2 with shortened terminal alkyl chain, features thermal annealing (TA)&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condense packing, leading to suppressed upshifts of highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and efficient charge transport at small phase separation in BTP&#8208;eC9 blended devices, obtaining the highest PCE of 17.11% with &#916;Vnr of 0.192 V in ASM&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
A critical bottleneck for further efficiency breakthroughs in organic solar cells (OSCs) is to minimize the non&#8208;radiative energy loss (e&#916;Vnr) while maximizing the charge generation. With the development of highly emissive low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, the design of high&#8208;performance donors becomes critical to enable the blend with the electroluminescence quantum efficiency to approach or surpass the pristine acceptor. Herein, by shortening the end&#8208;capped alkyl chains of the small&#8208;molecular donors from hexyl (MPhS&#8208;C6) to ethyl (MPhS&#8208;C2), the material obtained aggregation that was&#160;insensitive to thermal annealing (TA) along with&#160;condensed packing simultaneously. The former leads to small phase separation and suppressed upshifts of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and the latter facilitates its efficient charge&#8208;transport at aggregation&#8208;less packing. Hence, the &#916;Vnr decreases from 0.242 to 0.182&#160;V, from MPhS&#8208;C6 to MPhS&#8208;C2 based OSCs. An excellent PCE of 17.11% is obtained by 1,8&#8208;diiodoctane addition due to almost unchanged high Jsc (26.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Voc (0.888&#160;V) with improved fill factor, which is the record efficiency with the smallest energy loss (0.497&#160;eV) and &#916;Vnr (0.192&#160;V) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule OSCs. These results emphasize the potential material design direction of obtaining concurrent TA&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condensed packing to maximize the device performances with a super low &#916;Vnr.

Hence, the &#916;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; decreases from 0.242 to 0.182&#160;V, from MPhS-C6 to MPhS-C2 based OSCs. An excellent PCE of 17.11% is obtained by 1,8-diiodoctane addition due to almost unchanged high &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt; (26.6&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; (0.888&#160;V) with improved fill factor, which is the record efficiency with the smallest energy loss (0.497&#160;eV) and &#916;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; (0.192&#160;V) in all-small-molecule OSCs. These results emphasize the potential material design direction of obtaining concurrent TA-insensitive aggregation and condensed packing to maximize the device performances with a super low &#916;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Curable Acrylic Resins toward UV&#8208;Light&#8208;Blocking Adhesives for Foldable Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acrylic resin that can be efficiently polymerized using visible light in the presence of oxygen and UV&#8208;abosrbers is presented, which can be used to develop UV&#8208;blocking optically clear adhesives (OCAs) applicable in flexible displays. Using this system, a UV&#8208;blocking OCA that nearly meets the specifications of an OCA used in commercialized foldable smartphones is realized.








Abstract
Current technological advances in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode panel design of foldable smartphones demand advanced adhesives with UV&#8208;blocking abilities, beyond their conventional roles of bonding objects and relieving deformation stress. However, optically clear adhesives (OCAs) with UV&#8208;blocking ability cannot be prepared using conventional UV&#8208;curing methods relying on a photoinitiator. Herein, a new acrylic resin that can be efficiently cured using visible light without oxygen removal is presented, which may be used to develop UV&#8208;blocking OCAs for use in current flexible displays. A novel photocatalyst and a specific combination of additives facilitate sufficiently rapid curing under visible light in the presence of UV&#8208;absorbers. Only a very small amount of the highly active photocatalyst is required to prepare UV&#8208;blocking OCA films with very high transparency in the visible region. Using this system, a UV&#8208;blocking OCA that nearly meets the specifications of an OCA used in commercialized foldable smartphones is realized. This technology can also be utilized in other applications that require highly efficient visible light curing, such as optically clear resins, dental resins, and 3D/4D&#8208;printable materials.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Thermal Characterization of Dynamical VO2 Memristors via Local Activity Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact model connecting measurable material properties and device dimensions to circuit behavior of locally active memristors is presented, thus enabling rapid screening of neuromorphic materials for desired applications.








Abstract
Translating the surging interest in neuromorphic electronic components, such as those based on nonlinearities near Mott transitions, into large&#8208;scale commercial deployment faces steep challenges in the current lack of means to identify and design key material parameters. These issues are exemplified by the difficulties in connecting measurable material properties to device behavior via circuit element models. Here, the principle of local activity is used to build a model of VO2/SiN Mott threshold switches by sequentially accounting for constraints from a minimal set of quasistatic and dynamic electrical and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal data obtained via in situ thermoreflectance mapping. By combining independent data sets for devices with varying dimensions, the model is distilled to measurable material properties, and device scaling laws are established. The model can accurately predict electrical and thermal conductivities and capacitances and locally active dynamics (especially persistent spiking self&#8208;oscillations). The systematic procedure by which this model is developed has been a missing link in predictively connecting neuromorphic device behavior with their underlying material properties, and should enable rapid screening of material candidates before employing expensive manufacturing processes and testing procedures.

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Sb2Te3/GeTe Superlattice Film and Its Melt&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Free Phase&#8208;Transition Mechanism for Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ crystallized Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice film is grown by atomic layer deposition on the planar and sidewall memory cell, showing a significantly decreased reset current compared with the homogeneously mixed alloy. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress and effective electromigration of the Ge atoms induce a melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization mechanism.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice (SL) film on planar and vertical sidewall areas containing TiN metal and SiO2 insulator is demonstrated. The peculiar chemical affinity of the ALD precursor to the substrate surface and the 2D nature of the Sb2Te3 enable the growth of an in situ crystallized SL film with a preferred orientation. The SL film shows a reduced reset current of &#8776;1/7 of the randomly oriented Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. The reset switching is induced by the transition from the SL to the (111)&#8208;oriented face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy and subsequent melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress, induced by the SL&#8208;to&#8208;FCC structural transition, enhances the electromigration of Ge along the [111] direction of FCC structure, which enables such a significant improvement. Set operation switches the amorphous to the (111)&#8208;oriented FCC structure.

         <title>Biomineralized Two&#8208;Enzyme Nanoparticles Regulate Tumor Glycometabolism Inducing Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Robust Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomineralized two&#8208;enzyme nanoparticles are constructed using GOx, Mn2+, and HA (GOx&#8208;Mn/HA). GOx&#8208;Mn/HA can target the tumor site and, self&#8208;amplifying, regulate the tumor glycometabolism to cause tumor cell pyroptosis and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression. GOx&#8208;Mn/HA is further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to treat tumors, which can effectively inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis.








Abstract
Currently, immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a useful strategy for improving immunotherapy's therapeutic efficacy. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause serious side effects, so finding safe and effective methods to combine with immunotherapy is critical. In this work,&#160;regulating tumor glycometabolism is found to induce tumor cell pyroptosis and regulate the degree of expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Therefore, how to treat tumors by regulating tumor glycometabolism in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy is investigated here. First, the biomineralization&#8208;like method is used to construct nanoparticles with two&#8208;enzymatic activity by hybridizing nanozymes and glucose oxidase (GOx). It has the ability to self&#8208;amplify regulation of the glycometabolism of tumor cells. It can also induce tumor cell pyroptosis and increase the expression of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. To treat tumors, nanoparticles are further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, which substantially inhibits tumor development and significantly increases &#160;the survival time of mice. Combination therapy also has a significant immunological memory effect, successfully preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This is thought to be the first study that combines tumor glycometabolism with immunocheckpoint blocking in cancer therapy. This innovative, safe, low&#8208;toxic, and highly effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy can have good prospects in clinical applications.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adhesive On&#8208;Skin Sensors Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wireless Monitoring of Metabolites in Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials and techniques are demonstrated to achieve wearable and breathable sensing devices by integrating conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks with a flexible nanocellulose membrane. This robust sensor can self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin for the wireless and in situ monitoring of vitamin C in human sweat.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined porous structures and tailored functionalities have been widely used in chemical sensing. However, the integration of MOFs with flexible electronic devices for wearable sensing is challenging because of their low electrical conductivity and fragile mechanical properties. Herein, a wearable sweat sensor for metabolite detection is presented by integrating an electrically conductive Ni&#8208;MOF with a flexible nanocellulose substrate. The MOF&#8208;based layered film sensor with inherent conductivity, highly porous structure, and active catalytic properties enables the selective and accurate detection of vitamin C and uric acid. More importantly, the lightweight sensor can conformably self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin and exhibits high water&#8208;vapor permeability. Furthermore, a wireless epidermal nutrition tracking system for the in situ monitoring of the dynamics of sweat vitamin C is demonstrated, the results of which are comparable to those tested by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. This study opens a new avenue for integrating MOFs as the active layer in wearable electronic devices and holds promise for the future development of high&#8208;performance electronics with enhanced sensing, energy production, and catalytic capabilities through the implementation of multifunctional MOFs.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy for synthesizing hexagonal graphene with specific sizes is presented. The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based tunnel&#8208;junction structures and small&#8208;gapped quasi&#8208;monolayer films. This study provides a foundation for directly synthesizing 2D materials for applications in highly integrated electronics.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other 2D materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as bandgap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

         <title>Multifunctionality of Li2SrNb2O7: Memristivity, Tunable Rectification, Ferroelasticity, and Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered perovskite Li2SrNb2O7&#160;bulk single crystals are synthesized. At room temperature, Li ions show significant intralayer activities, which creates a giant memristivity and a rectification effect combining with a relaxation upon time. At low temperature, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectricity develop, and the rectification state becomes robust. The results demonstrate a selectively controlling of the ferroic orders and ionic migration.








Abstract
Layered Li2SrNb2O7, an inorganic oxide in its bulk single&#8208;crystalline form, is experimentally demonstrated to exhibit multiple structural facets such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and antiferroelectricity. The transition from a room temperature (RT) centrosymmetric structure to a low&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectric structure and the low&#8208;temperature (LT) ferroelectric domain configuration are unveiled in TEM, piezoresponse force microscopy, and polarization loop studies. Li2SrNb2O7&#160;also exhibits highly tunable ferroelasticity and excellent Li+ in&#8208;plane conduction, which leads to a giant in&#8208;plane memristor behavior and an in&#8208;plane electronic conductivity increase by three orders of magnitude by electric poling at room RT). The accumulation of Li+ vacancies at the crystal&#8211;electrode interface is visualized using in&#160;situ optical microscopy. The Li&#8208;ionic biased state shows a clear in&#8208;plane rectification effect combined with a significant relaxation upon time at RT. Relaxation can be fully suppressed at LTs such as 200&#160;K, and utilizing an electric field cooling, a stable rectification can be achieved at 200&#160;K. The results shed light on the selective control of multifunctionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and ionic&#8208;migration&#8208;mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single&#8208;phase bulk material utilizing, for example, different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar thermoelectric generator is fabricated with outstanding temperature difference and the property of synergistic utilization of solar energy and waste heat by in situ redox reaction to construct n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one nanowire film that is the reverse side of passive radiative cooling film. The ordered nanowire film also imparts the solar thermoelectric generator with better thermoelectrical performance.








Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in addressing the problem of global warming, owing to their unique features of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, a flexible 3D Janus helical ribbon architecture is designed, starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling the cold side with a passive radiative cooling technique and the hot side with a selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K, which is much higher than previously reported devices under a low solar radiation of only 614 W m&#8722;2. Especially, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Socketed Sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Copper for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing perovskite&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures through in situ socketing sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu onto perovskite backbones provides a favorable platform for efficient and stable CO2 electroreduction (CER) to C2+ products. Within such heteronanostructures, the significant strong metal&#8211;support interactions, which modulate electronic structure of active Cu and strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion, play key roles in simultaneously enhancing CER activity, selectivity for C2+ products, and stability.








Abstract
In situ socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO2 electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here, a CER catalyst of perovskite&#8208;socketed sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) is constructed to promote efficient and stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub&#8208;3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also to strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical&#8208;mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C2+, together with greatly boosted stability (&gt;80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures for CER.

These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also to strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu-based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical-mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;, together with greatly boosted stability (&amp;gt;80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu-based heteronanostructures for CER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Compositionally Graded Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;alloy&#8208;based broadband optoelectronic device applications.








Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8776;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys is fabricated. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition shows a spatial gradient in the light&#8208;emission energy, which varies from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. This alloy is incorporated in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device is successfully fabricated by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

It is proved&#160;that a bilayer nanostructure array is sufficient to completely control amplitudes, polarizations, and phases of coherent light transmission. Universal metasurfaces with such full control are realized with silicon nanostructures. A new kind of 3D&#160;vector hologram and a general platform for arbitrary optical transformation are demonstrated. This work provides another degree of freedom in light transmission control.








Recent advances in metasurfaces and optical nanostructures have enabled complex control of incident light with optically thin devices. However, it has thus far been unclear whether it is possible to achieve complete linear control of coherent light transmission, that is, independent control of polarization, amplitude, and phase for both input polarization states, with just a single, thin nanostructure array. Here, it is proved possible, and a universal metasurface is proposed, a bilayer array of high&#8208;index elliptic cylinders&#160;that possesses a complete degree of optical freedom with fully designable chirality and anisotropy. The completeness of achievable light control is mathematically shown with corresponding Jones matrices, new types of 3D&#160;holographic schemes that&#160;were&#160;formerly impossible are experimentally demonstrated, and a systematic way of realizing any input&#8208;state&#8208;sensitive vector linear optical device is presented. The results unlock previously inaccessible degrees of freedom in light transmission control.

         <title>Enhanced Competition at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface Enables Comprehensive Characterization of Protein Corona Dynamics and Deep Coverage of Proteomes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing competition at the nano&#8211;bio interface, protein corona diversity and detection of low&#8208;abundance proteins such as cytokines and chemokines are significantly improved. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) data captures corona dynamics for 3000 individual proteins and provides a crucial resource for in&#8208;depth modeling of nano&#8211;bio interactions and the Vroman effect for in vitro and in vivo applications of nanomaterials.








Abstract
Introducing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into a biofluid such as blood plasma leads to the formation of a selective and reproducible protein corona at the particle&#8211;protein interface, driven by the relationship between protein&#8211;NP affinity and protein abundance. This enables&#160;scalable systems that leverage protein&#8211;nano interactions to&#160;overcome current limitations of deep plasma proteomics in large cohorts. Here the importance of the protein to NP&#8208;surface ratio (P/NP) is demonstrated and protein corona formation dynamics are modeled, which determine the competition between proteins for binding. Tuning the P/NP ratio significantly modulates the protein corona composition, enhancing depth and precision of a fully automated NP&#8208;based deep proteomic workflow (Proteograph). By increasing the binding competition on engineered NPs, 1.2&#8211;1.7&#215; more proteins with 1% false discovery rate are identified on the surface of each NP, and up to 3&#215; more proteins compared to a standard plasma proteomics workflow. Moreover, the data suggest P/NP plays a significant role in determining the in vivo fate of nanomaterials in biomedical applications. Together, the study showcases the importance of P/NP as a key design element for biomaterials and nanomedicine in vivo and as a powerful tuning strategy for accurate, large&#8208;scale NP&#8208;based deep proteomic studies.

         <title>Metal Confined in 2D Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/Ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally confining metal into 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channels, a graphene oxide (GO) interlayer with size&#8208;sieving property and molecular recognition effect can efficiently discriminate ethylene over ethane. The GO membrane exhibits outstanding separation performance far exceeding the ethylene/ethane upper&#8208;bound. The metal confined in the 2D nanostructure will be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while it remains a great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size&#8208;sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, a metal confined 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channel is reported to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy observes that the metals with size of &#8776;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in graphene oxide (GO) interlayer channels with average height of &#8776;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating the size&#8208;sieving effect with a molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8776;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore&#8208;Confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein&#8208;MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis is developed. The enhanced catalytic activity of the Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single&#8208;atoms, mesopores, and well&#8208;regulated coordination environment simultaneously&#160;and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) is developed successfully via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein&#8208;MOF&#8208;templated Fe&#8208;SACs achieve up to 23&#8208;fold and 47&#8208;fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single&#8208;atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25&#8208;fold and 1900&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzymes and natural&#8208;enzyme&#8208;immobilized MOFs. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal&#8208;containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe&#8208;SACs act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins&#8208;MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>An Integrated 3D Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity Design for Artificial Sweating Skin (i&#8208;TRANS) Mimicking Human Body Perspiration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface modification method for fibrous materials is developed to fabricate artificial sweating skin, based on an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design. With the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both the lateral and vertical directions, the constructed &#8220;skin&#8221; can transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation.








Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, and textiles. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design is proposed for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

         <title>A Smart Photothermal Nanosystem with an Intrinsic Temperature&#8208;Control Mechanism for Thermostatic Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism is established for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections. In contrast to conventional photothermal therapy with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments. However, conventional photothermal systems do not possess a temperature&#8208;control mechanism, which poses a serious risk to healthy tissues and/or organs due to inevitable thermal damage. Herein, a smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections is reported. The smart photothermal nanosystem is constructed by loading a thermochromic material into a hollow&#8208;structured silica nanocarrier, in which the thermochromic material is composed of naturally occurring phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), a proton&#8208;responsive spirolactone, and a proton source. The resulting nanosystem shows strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and efficient photothermal conversion in solid PCMs but becomes NIR&#8208;transparent when PCMs are melted upon NIR irradiation. Such an attractive feature can precisely regulate the photothermal equilibrium temperature to the melting point of PCMs, regardless of the variation in external experimental parameters. In contrast to conventional PTT with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds. The smart photothermal nanosystem is a versatile PTT platform, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial infections and multimodality synergistic therapy.

         <title>Chemical Welding of the Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface by Zn&#8208;Metal&#8208;Initiated In Situ Gelation for Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ gel electrolyte initiated by Zn metal produces chemical welding between the anode and the electrolyte, enabling a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface that suppresses the growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions while improving the Zn utilization up to 87%. The as&#8208;prepared cells showcase superior cycling stability, with an ultralong life of over 212&#160;days.








Abstract
A compatible and robust electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is favorable in resolving the severe dendritic growth and side reactions of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries toward commercial&#8208;standard lifespan and charging&#8211;discharging rate. Herein, a chemical welding strategy through in&#160;situ construction of a gel electrolyte that enables Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve ultralong life and reversibility is reported. The gel electrolyte is spontaneously formed on the Zn anode surface by redox polymerization with the initiation of Zn metal. The direct participation of the Zn anode in the chemical synthesis of the gel electrolyte brings a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which not only alleviates side reactions but also enables preferential (002) Zn deposition. The in&#160;situ symmetric cell thus prepared delivers an ultralong lifespan of 5100&#160;h (&gt;212&#160;days), and a hybrid capacitor with the in&#160;situ electrolyte runs smoothly over 40&#160;000&#160;cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and capacity of 40&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, the cell still operates stably for 240&#160;h, alongside a high Zn utilization with 87% depth of discharge. The in&#160;situ gel electrolyte integrating robust interface and preparation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one cells demonstrate a commercializable path for aqueous Zn&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Function Electrolyte Regulation toward Advanced Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Zn&#8208;battery issues in aqueous media are fundamentally studied, revealing that besides the well&#8208;known H2 evolution and dendrite growth, Zn electrodes also face an O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction. Thus, a one&#8208;off electrolyte regulation is proposed by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P additive, which can take effects to suppress the O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction, water decomposition, and dendritic deposition during the shelf time.








Abstract
The poor Zn reversibility has been criticized for limiting applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs); however, its behavior in aqueous media is not fully uncovered yet. Here, this knowledge gap is addressed, indicating that Zn electrodes face a O2&#8208;involving corrosion, besides H2 evolution and dendrite growth. Differing from aqueous Li/Na batteries, removing O2 cannot enhance ZIB performance because of the aggravated competing H2 evolution. To address Zn issues, a one&#8208;off electrolyte strategy is reported by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P, which can take effects during the shelf time of battery. It regulates H+ concentration and reduces free&#8208;water activity, inhibiting H2 evolution. A self&#8208;healing solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be triggered before battery operation, which suppresses O2 adsorption corrosion and dendritic deposition. Consequently, a high Zn reversibility of 99.6% is achieved under a high discharge depth of 85%. The pouch full&#8208;cell with a lean electrolyte displays a record lifespan with capacity retention of 95.5% after 500 cycles. This study not only looks deeply into Zn behavior in aqueous media but also underscores rules for the design of active metal anodes, including Zn and Li metals, during shelf time toward real applications.

A flexible and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; structure is designed for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries, in which an in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability.








Abstract
The construction of robust (quasi)&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries is desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, a novel, flexible, and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; design is reported for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). An in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26&#160;V, and a good rate performance are achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as&#8208;designed QSSEs deliver areal capacity of up to 3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at the initial cycle with high mass loading of 14.8&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li&#8208;NCM811 cells and can retain &#8776;80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong&#8208;life of 3000 cycles (6000&#160;h) is also achieved in Li&#8208;LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE toward ultralong&#8208;life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>A Honeycomb&#8208;Like Porous Crystalline Hetero&#8208;Electrocatalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of honeycomb&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)@covalent organic framework (COF) heterostructures with integrated porous MOF template and ultrathin COF coating are synthesized and successfully applied in efficient CO2 electroreduction to CH4.








Abstract
Porous heterostructured electrocatalysts with multifunctionality and synergistic effect have much benefit for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet it still remains a daunting challenge to explore heterostructures based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in this field. Here, a series of honeycomb&#8208;like porous crystalline hetero&#8208;electrocatalysts (MCH&#8208;X, X&#160;= 1&#8211;4, X stands for the numbered sample obtained from different MOF doses in the synthesis of the MCH) are synthesized, and these are successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The specially designed heterostructures with integrated porous MOF&#8208;template and ultrathin COF&#8208;coating enable efficient CO2 adsorption/activation and conversion into CH4. The best of them, MCH&#8208;3, shows greatly inhibited H2 evolution, excellent current density (&#8722;398.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and superior FECH4${\rm{F}}{{\rm{E}}_{{\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_4}}}$ (76.7%) to the physical mixture (38.0%), the MOF@COF without the honeycomb&#8208;like morphology (47.7%), and the bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8722;1.0&#160;V. Based on the density functional theory calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of the MOF in facilitating CO2 adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step are intensively studied.

         <title>Beyond Human Touch Perception: An Adaptive Robotic Skin Based on Gallium Microgranules for Pressure Sensory Augmentation</title>

An adaptive robotic skin with augmented pressure sensing ability is introduced. Integrated tunable pressure sensors built with uniform gallium microgranules provide high sensitivity and bandwidth and excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, enabling a large&#8208;scale robotic skin with sensing performance superior to human skin. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations show its unique sensing capability and versatility covering a broad range of pressure.








Robotic skin with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like sensing ability holds immense potential in various fields such as robotics, prosthetics, healthcare, and industries. To catch up with human skin, numerous studies are underway on pressure sensors integrated on robotic skin to improve the sensitivity and detection range. However, due to the trade&#8208;off between them, existing pressure sensors have achieved only a single aspect, either high sensitivity or wide bandwidth. Here, an adaptive robotic skin is proposed that has both high sensitivity and broad bandwidth with an augmented pressure sensing ability beyond the human skin. A key for the adaptive robotic skin is a tunable pressure sensor built with uniform gallium microgranules embedded in an elastomer, which provides large tuning of the sensitivity and the bandwidth, excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, and high reliability. Through the mode conversion based on the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium microgranules, the sensor provides 97% higher sensitivity (16.97 kPa&#8722;1) in the soft mode and 262.5% wider bandwidth (&#8776;1.45&#160;MPa) in the rigid mode compared to the human skin. Successful demonstration of the adaptive robotic skin verifies its capabilities in sensing a wide spectrum of pressures ranging from subtle blood pulsation to body weight, suggesting broad use for various applications.

         <title>Nonequilibrium Lattice Dynamics in Photoexcited 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonequilibrium structures of 2D perovskites are studied using ultrafast X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffraction peaks post&#8208;photoexcitation increase in intensity and narrow over 1 ns, suggesting an increase in long&#8208;range order within the lead iodide octahedra. These results are corroborated using ultrafast photoluminescence, which shows redshifting and narrowing of photoluminescence peaks on the same timescale as transient X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
Interplay between structural and photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites is critical to their utility in optoelectronics, but there is limited understanding of lattice response upon photoexcitation. Here, 2D perovskites butylammonium lead iodide, (BA)2PbI4, and phenethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, are investigated using ultrafast transient X&#8208;ray diffraction as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics. Both powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence linewidths narrow over 1 ns following optical excitation for the fluence range studied, concurrent with slight redshifting of the optical bandgaps. These observations are attributed to transient relaxation and ordering of distorted lead iodide octahedra stimulated mainly by electron&#8211;hole pair creation. The c axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the a and b axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post&#8208;photoexcitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)2PbI4 would suggest a transient phase transition,&#160;however, through new single&#8208;crystal XRD, reflections are found that violate glide plane conditions in the reported Pbca structure. The static structure space group is reassigned as P212121. With this, a nonequilibrium phase transition is ruled out. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.

         <title>Strong Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction between Iridium Single Atoms and a WO3 Support Promotes Highly Efficient and Robust CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir single atoms are stably anchored on the WO3 support via a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). The catalyst demonstrates an excellent activity and stability for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate at relatively low temperatures, superior to most other heterogeneous competitors. Such a great performance is understood as a direct result of the strong EMSI effect.








Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) cycloaddition of epoxides to cyclic carbonates is of great industrial importance owing to the high economical values of its products. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in CO2 cycloaddition by virtue of their high atom utilization efficiency and desired activity, but they generally suffer from poor reaction stability and catalytic activity arising from the weak interaction between the active centers and the supports. In this work, Ir single atoms stably anchored on the WO3 support (Ir1&#8211;WO3) are developed with a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). Superior CO2 cycloaddition is realized in the Ir1&#8211;WO3 catalyst via the EMSI effect: 100% conversion efficiency for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate after 15&#160;h at 40 &#176;C and excellent stability with no degradation even after ten reaction cycles for a total of more than 150&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the EMSI effect results in significant charge redistribution between the Ir single atoms and the WO3 support, and consequently lowers the energy barrier associated with epoxide ring opening. This work furnishes new insights into the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition and would guide the design of stable SACs for efficient CO2 cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;Color Organic Afterglow through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and universal strategy is proposed to prepare high&#8208;performance and robust organic afterglow with high figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit by 2D&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices embedment of phosphors. Deep&#8208;blue organic afterglow with high efficiency up to 65%, ultralong lifetime over 1300 ms, and robust emission that can resist the quenching effects from oxygen, solvent, stress, and heat is achieved.








Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originating from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited states has shown amazing potential in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors are protected and stabilized by embedding in tricomponent trihapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light, and heat. In addition, the POA color is tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to the fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit displays and direct&#8208;current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications are facilely realized.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of self&#8208;healing can be determined through kinetic dynamics under an electric field in terms of an &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic morphology variations in Prussian blue analogue electrodes.








Abstract
Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge&#8211;discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self&#8208;healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic self&#8208;healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self&#8208;healing electrodes for cathodes.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;cell electrophoretic deposition strategy to assemble covalent organic frameworks (COFs) nanosheets into ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures within several minutes is reported. The constructed COF membranes exhibit outstanding separation performance toward the negatively charged probe molecules with a dimension larger than 1&#160;nm due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy is developed based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. Ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design of Molybdenum&#8211;Selenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of the synergy between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms for the promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction performance is highlighted. This is similar to the synergy of nonmetallic elements and metal active centers in enzymes. More importantly, the distance effect between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms is clarified.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo&#8208;dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, a heteronuclear Mo&#8211;Se dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (MoSA&#8211;SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is demonstrated here. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with the ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through long&#8208;range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. This work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in&#8208;depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric resonators are ubiquitous elements for frequency filtering in telecom devices. A piezoelectric resonator consisting of a suspended van der Waals heterostructure of ultrathin single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing BaTiO3 sandwiched between graphene sheets is reported. The heterostructure is piezoelectrically driven into a flexural motion and the resulting mechanics shows ferroelectric switching. The bulk&#8208;mode resonance at 233 GHz is the highest reported.








Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes are combined with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultrathin piezoelectric resonators. It is demonstrated that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the DC bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, the BTO membrane is switched between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. In the bulk acoustic mode, the device vibrates at 233 GHz. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.








Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy&#8208;Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent energy&#8208;storage properties with an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 and a large efficiency &#8776;87.6% are realized in lead&#8208;free relaxor ferroelectrics, which is responsible by the local diverse polarization design, leading to the ultrasmall polar nanoregions, reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to single polarization configuration.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8776;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy&#8208;storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8776;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8776;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8776;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance.

The excellent comprehensive energy-storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8776;187.5 MW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, discharge energy density &#8776;3.52 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, discharge rate &#8776;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy-storage performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Robotic Skin
In article number 2204805, Jae&#8208;Woong Jeong and co&#8208;workers report an adaptive robotic skin with an augmented pressure&#8208;sensing capability beyond that of human skin. The robotic skin is composed of gallium microgranules fabricated uniformly using a T&#8208;junction microfluidic system. Through the phase transition of gallium microgranules, it achieves a higher sensitivity in the soft mode and a broader dynamic range in the rigid mode compared to human skin.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
In article number 2205674, Kang Liang and co&#8208;workers develop a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered single&#8208;atom catalysts via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8208;organic frameworks followed by pyrolysis. The enhanced activity of the obtained catalysts benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, the mesopores, and the regulated coordination environment of the single&#8208;atom active sites induced by the metalloproteins.

Confined 2D Channels
2D&#8208;material membranes have demonstrated great potential in molecular separation. In article number 2206349, Gongping Liu and co&#8208;workers rationally confine metal into sub&#8208;nanometer GO galleries, endowing 2D channels with molecular recognition and sieving properties for discriminating ethylene over ethane. The metal confined in a 2D nanostructure would be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.

Light&#8208;Emitting Devices
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized by Jiang Pu, Yasumitsu Miyata, Taishi Takenobu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203250 using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7 eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor alloy based broadband optoelectronic device applications.

Proteomics
In article number 2206008, Omid C. Farokhzad, Daniel Hornburg, and co&#8208;workers show how the Vroman effect can be leveraged to capture the complexity of human proteomes using engineered nanoparticles. Protein corona formation dynamics demonstrate how nanoparticle functionalization and nano&#8211;bio binding competition enable deep and quantitative interrogation of biosamples. This facilitates increased capture of low&#8208;abundance proteins, including cytokines and chemokines, enabling new strategies for biomarker discovery and personalized nanomedicine.

         <title>Organic Hole&#8208;Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low&#8208;temperature processing, negligible hysteresis, and superior stability. For these devices, hole&#8208;transport layers play a decisive role in carrier extraction, transport, and perovskite crystallization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural engineering of organic hole&#8208;transport layers utilized in inverted PSCs including conductive polymers, small molecules, and emerging self&#8208;assembled monolayers.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability, and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy level, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability, and overall low cost. Here, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules, and self&#8208;assembled monolayers, as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole&#8208;transport properties, energy levels, and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook toward highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for understanding potential biomarkers of epilepsy is provided and they are classified them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis. Then, the materials used to fabricate the imaging probes and their performances in defining the epileptic foci are highlighted. Imaging strategies overcoming the heterogenous nature of epilepsy are thoroughly discussed.








Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. Herein, the potential biomarkers of EF are first summarized and classified into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of nonepileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review can be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.

         <title>Integrated Polymeric mRNA Vaccine without Inflammation Side&#8208;Effects for Cellular Immunity Mediated Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Among the few available mRNA delivery vehicles, lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is the most clinically advanced one but requires cumbersome four components and suffers from inflammation&#8208;related side effects which should be minimized for safety. Yet, a certain level of proinflammatory responses and innate immune activation is required to evoke T&#8208;cell immunity for mRNA cancer vaccination. To address these issues and develop potent yet low&#8208;inflammatory mRNA cancer vaccine vectors, we synthesized a series of alternating copolymers &#8220;PHTA&#8221; featured with ortho&#8208;hydroxy tertiary amine (HTA) repeating units for mRNA delivery, which can play triple roles of condensing mRNA, enhancing the polymeric nanoparticle (PNP) stability, and prolonging circulation time. Unlike the LNPs exhibiting high levels of inflammation, the PHTA&#8208;based PNPs showed negligible inflammatory side effects in vivo. Importantly, the top candidate PHTA&#8208;C18 enabled successful mRNA cancer vaccine delivery in vivo and led to a robust CD8+ T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor cellular immunity. Such PHTA&#8208;based integrated PNP provides a potential approach for establishing mRNA cancer vaccines with good inflammatory safety profiles.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Triggered Transformable Polypeptide Self&#8208;Assembly to Initiate Tumor&#8208;Specific Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomineralization is a normal physiological process that includes nucleation, crystal growth, phase transformation, and orientation evolution. Notably, artificially induced biomineralization in the tumor tissue has emerged as an unconventional yet promising modality for malignancy therapy. However, the modest ion&#8208;chelating capabilities of carboxyl&#8208;containing biomineralization initiators lead to a deficient blockade, thus compromising antitumor efficacy. Herein, a biomineralization&#8208;inducing nanoparticle (BINP) is developed for the blockade therapy of osteosarcoma. BINP is composed of dodecylamine&#8208;poly((&#947;&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate)&#8208;co&#8208;(l&#8208;histidine))&#8208;block&#8208;poly(l&#8208;glutamate&#8208;graft&#8208;alendronate) and combines a cytomembrane&#8208;insertion moiety, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive component, and an ion&#8208;chelating motif. After intravenous injection into osteosarcoma&#8208;bearing mice, BINP responds to the acidic TME to expose the dodecyl group on the surface of expanded nanoparticle, facilitating its cytomembrane insertion. Subsequently, the protruding bisphosphonic acid group triggers continuous ion deposition to construct a mineralized barrier around the tumor, which blocks substance exchange between the tumor and surrounding normal tissues. The BINP&#8208;mediated blockade therapy displays tumor inhibition rates of 59.3% and 52.1% for subcutaneous and orthotopic osteosarcomas, respectively, compared with the Control group. In addition, the suppression of osteoclasts by the alendronate moiety alleviates bone dissolution and further inhibits pulmonary metastases. Hence, the BINP&#8208;initiated selective biomineralization provides a promising alternative for clinical osteosarcoma therapy.

         <title>Orbital Interactions between Organic Semiconductor Spacer and Inorganic Layer in Dion&#8722;Jacobson Perovskite Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites have become emerging photovoltaic materials owing to their intrinsic structure stability. However, as insulating aliphatic cations were widely used as spacers, the interactions between the spacers and inorganic layers in DJ perovskites have rarely been studied. Here, an organic semiconductor spacer with two covalently connected thiophene ring, namely bithiophene dimethylammonium (BThDMA), was successfully developed for 2D DJ perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An important finding is that there are strong orbital interactions between conjugated organic spacer and adjacent inorganic layers, whereas no such interactions exist in DJ perovskite using aliphatic octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminium (ODA) spacer with similar length. The BThDMA spacer with multiple conjugated aromatic rings could also induce the crystal growth with large grain size and preferred vertical orientation, resulting in reduced trap density and improved charge carrier mobility. As a result, the optimized device based on (BThDMA)MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n = 5) shows an excellent PCE of 18.1% with negligible hysteresis, which is a record efficiency for 2D DJ PSCs using spacer with two or more covalently linked aromatic rings. Our findings provide a novel and important insight on achieving efficient and stable 2D DJ perovskite solar cells by developing organic semiconductor spacers.

         <title>Merging the Interfaces of Different Shape&#8208;Shifting Polymers Using Hybrid Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sophisticated shape&#8208;shifting structures and integration of advanced functions often call for different&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based polymers (such as epoxy and polyurethane) in a unified system. However, permanent crosslinks pose crucial obstacles to seamless. Here we propose to merge interfaces via hybrid exchange reactions among different dynamic covalent bonds (including ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8208;ester and oxime&#8208;ester linkages), breaking the long&#8208;lasting restriction that these widely&#8208;used bonds only undergo self&#8208;exchange reactions. Model compound studies are conducted to verify that hybrid exchange reactions occur. As demonstrations, different liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are tenaciously joined into coherent assemblies, with desired biomimetic structures (e.g., flying fish containing stiff and flexible parts) and rare deformation modes (e.g., flower blooming upon both heating and cooling). Besides connecting polymers, hybrid exchange reactions also facilitate the creation of new materials through cross&#8208;fusion of different polymers. In addition to the polymers used in this work, hybrid exchange reactions can be adapted to other polymers based on similar mechanisms and beyond. Besides shape&#8208;shifting related areas (e.g., soft robots, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices), it may also foster innovation in other fields involving general polymers, as well as promote deeper understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry.

         <title>Precise Functionalization of Multiple Resonance Framework: Constructing Narrowband Organic Electroluminescent Materials with External Quantum Efficiency over 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is of important strategic significance to develop high&#8208;efficiency narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be employed to fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;definition display with wide color gamut. This topic implies a great challenge to molecular design and synthesis, especially for the development of universality, diversity, scalability and robustness of molecular architectonics. In this contribution, a synthetic methodology has been demonstrated for functionalizing brominated B&#8208;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance (MR) framework with multifarious functional groups, such as donors, acceptors and moieties without obvious push&#8208;pull electron properties. The m&#8208;DPAcP&#8208;BNCz&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibits green emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 28&#160;nm and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.6%. The outstanding performance of m&#8208;DPAcP&#8208;BNC is attributed to the perfect integration of the inherent advantages of MR framework and donor&#8211;acceptor configuration, which can not only achieve bathochromic shift and narrowband emission, but also obtain high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#1060;PL) and horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio (&#920;//). This straightforward and efficient approach provides insightful guidance for the construction and enrichment of more high&#8208;efficiency narrowband emitters.

         <title>High&#8208;Q Thin Film Lithium Niobate Microrings Fabricated with Wet Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thin&#8208;film lithium niobate (TFLN) has been widely used in electro&#8208;optic modulators, acoustic&#8208;optic modulators, electro&#8208;optic frequency combs and nonlinear wavelength converters owing to the excellent optical properties of lithium niobate. The performance of these devices is highly dependent on the fabrication quality of TFLN. Although state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TFLN microrings with an intrinsic quality factor (Q&#8208;factor) exceeding 1 &#215; 107 have been realized by inductively coupled plasma&#8211;reactive ion etching (ICP&#8208;RIE) and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), ICP&#8208;RIE has moderate throughput, moderate reproducibility and high cost in etching TFLN while CMP features moderate throughput and low cost in etching TFLN. Here, we&#160;developed a wet etching method for TFLN, leading to the fabrication of a micro&#8208;racetrack with an intrinsic Q&#8208;factor of over 9.27 &#215; 106. The suitability of this method to fabricate a narrow coupling gap between the bus waveguide and microring enables the coupling conditions of the microring to be customized. This method features a high throughput, a high reproducibility and a low cost in etching TFLN, showing the potential to boost the mass production of integrated LN photonic devices with high fidelity and affordability&#160;dramatically.

         <title>Photoswitchable Microgels for Dynamic Macrophage Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light is demonstrated. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light stimulates in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that increases RGD availability, thereby facilitating macrophage adhesion linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization. Visible light induces the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that decreases RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled structures is achieved irreversibly or under non&#8208;physiological conditions, thereby limiting their biomedical, environmental, and catalysis applicability. In this study, microgels composed of azobenzene derivatives stacked via &#960;&#8211;cation and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are developed that are electrostatically stabilized with Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD)&#8208;bearing anionic polymers. Lateral swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels occurs via cis&#8208;azobenzene formation mediated by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light, which disrupts intermolecular interactions on the visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;coated materials. Real&#8208;time imaging and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;azobenzene formation. Near&#8208;infrared light can induce in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to increase RGD availability and trigger release of loaded interleukin&#8208;4, which facilitates the adhesion structure assembly linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of host macrophages. In contrast, visible light can induce deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to decrease RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization. These microgels exhibit high stability and non&#8208;toxicity. Versatile use of ligands and protein delivery can offer cytocompatible and photoswitchable manipulability of diverse host cells.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of sp&#8208;N Doping in Graphdiyne for Developing Site&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides opening the black box of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N) doping in graphdiyne, the relationship between N configurations and reaction routes in CO2 reduction is clarified. The sp&#8208;N atoms would induce high selectivity toward CH4 generation, owing to the optimized adsorption of precursor and intermediate. This work would guide the site&#8208;defined doping in carbon materials for advanced catalysts.








Abstract
Due to the limited reserves of metals, scientists are devoted to exploring high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free catalysts based on carbon materials to solve environment&#8208;related issues. Doping would build up inhomogeneous charge distribution on surface, which is an efficient approach for boosting the catalytic performance. However, doping sites are difficult to control in traditional carbon materials, thus hindering their development. Taking the advantage of unique sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (GDY), a new N doping configuration of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N), bringing a Pt&#8208;comparable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction is site&#8208;defined introduced. However, the reaction intermediate of this process is never captured, hindering the understanding of the mechanism and the precise synthesis of metal&#8208;free catalysts. After the four&#8208;year study, the fabrication of intermediate&#8208;like molecule is realized, and finally sp&#8208;N doped GDY via the pericyclic reaction is obtained. Compared with GDY doped with other N configurations, the designed sp&#8208;N GDY shows much higher catalytic activity in electroreduction of CO2 toward CH4 production, owing to the unique electronic structure introduced by sp&#8208;N, which is more favorable in stabilizing the intermediate. Thus, besides opening the black&#8208;box for the site&#8208;defined doping, this work reveals the relationship between doping configuration and products of CO2 reduction.

         <title>Oral Supramolecular Adsorbent for Preventing Chemo&#8208;Induced Gastrointestinal Mucositis and Microbial Dysbiosis and for Enhancing Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orally administered polymeric adsorbent (SPORA&#8208;SN9) that can selectively adsorb chemo exposure in the GI tract is developed. The SPORA&#8208;SN9 sharply decreases the toxic chemo content of the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen, thereby preventing chemo&#8208;induced GI mucositis and chemo&#8208;induced microbial dysbiosis. Interestingly, the protected gut microbiome improves the antitumor efficacy of the followed immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to cytotoxic chemotherapy has emerged as the first&#8208;line treatment for multiple cancers. Paradoxically, cytotoxic chemotherapy may limit the therapeutic potential of ICB by significantly impairing the largest immune organ, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and driving gut microbial dysbiosis. Here, an orally administered polymeric adsorbent containing a supramolecular motif (named SPORA&#8208;SN9) is reported, which can selectively remove chemotherapeutics from the GI tract, thereby preventing chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis and microbial dysbiosis and providing better chemoimmunotherapy synergy. By theoretical design and experimental screening of the molecular recognition motifs, SPORA&#8208;SN9 exhibits superior complexation capacity for doxorubicin and irinotecan and high selectivity over a range of commonly used combinational medications. In mouse models of chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis, SPORA&#8208;SN9 protects the integrity of the GI tissues and the homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Finally, the addition of SPORA&#8208;SN9 enhances the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. SPORA&#8208;SN9 offers a translational approach for supramolecular chemistry to modulate complex biosystems by selectively removing target substrates from the GI tract.

         <title>Large Exchange Coupling Between Localized Spins and Topological Bands in MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic topological materials rely on strong interaction between localized spins and states comprising the topological bands. This interaction is directly interrogated in an intrinsic magnetic topological material, MnBi2Te4, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. It is found that this exchange coupling is &gt;100 times stronger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of &gt;25 meV.








Abstract
Magnetism in topological materials creates phases exhibiting quantized transport phenomena with potential technological applications. The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized spins and the topological bands, and the consequent formation of an exchange gap. However, this remains experimentally unquantified in intrinsic magnetic topological materials. Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi2Te4, a topological insulator with intrinsic antiferromagnetism. This is achieved by optically exciting Bi&#8208;Te p states comprising the bulk topological bands and interrogating the consequent Mn 3d spin dynamics, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. Ultrafast electron scattering and magneto&#8208;optic measurements show that the p states demagnetize via electron&#8208;phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation, the Mn 3d spins, probed by resonant X&#8208;ray scattering, are observed to disorder concurrently with the p spins. Together with atomistic simulations, this reveals that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the surface states. By quantifying this exchange coupling, this study validates the materials&#8208;by&#8208;design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to manipulate topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.

         <title>An Electrochemical&#8208;Electret Coupled Organic Synapse with Single&#8208;Polarity Driven Reversible Facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;Depression Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced organic synapse with single&#8208;polarity presynaptic voltage driven facilitation and depression is reported. The device is controlled by the coupling effect in a polyelectrolyte&#8208;electret bilayer. It produces synaptic facilitation by electrochemical doping and depression by electret&#8208;charging. As a result, the device outperforms conventional organic electrochemical synapses with simplified operations and sophisticated functionality.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decade electrolyte&#8208;gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of the synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here, an electrochemical&#8208;electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;depression switch,&#160;is devised. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold&#8208;controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude&#8208;dependent, dual&#8208;modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying the energy level offset between the channel material and the electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g., imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives toward the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency, and endurance.

         <title>Dielectric Polymer with Designable Large Motion under Low Electric Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions is reported to be actuated under low electric fields (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1). The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This induces a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can demonstrate&#160;fast and large in&#8208;plane expansion/contraction due to electric field (e&#8208;field)&#8208;induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in&#8208;plane actuation is converted into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving e&#8208;field (20&#8211;100&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises their durability. Here, a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low e&#8208;field (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1) is reported. The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This gives rise to a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation, leading to designable large motions when the dielectric polymer is heated above its melting temperature to become a DE. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability. These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered, Implantable, and Wirelessly Controlled NO Generation System for Intracranial Neuroglioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated and self&#8208;powered NO generation system for intracranial glioma gas therapy is designed. The NO releasing device, which is intracranially&#160;implanted, can be driven by a wearable triboelectric nanogenerator, and the system is wirelessly operated by a smartphone to control NO release for efficient intracranial glioma therapy.








Abstract
Gas therapy is an emerging technology for improving cancer therapy with high efficiency and low side effects. However, due to the existence of the gatekeeper of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the limited availability of current drug delivery systems, there still have been no reports on gas therapy for intracranial neuroglioma. Herein, an integrated, self&#8208;powered, and wirelessly controlled gas&#8208;therapy system is reported, which is composed of a self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an implantable nitric oxide (NO) releasing device for intracranial neuroglioma therapy. In the system, the patient self&#8208;driven TENG converts the mechanical energy of body movements into electricity as a sustainable and self&#8208;controlled power source. When delivering energy to light a&#160;light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;in the implantable NO releasing device via wireless control, the encapsulated NO donor s&#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can generate NO gas to locally kill the glioma cells. The efficacy of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system in subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer model in mice and intracranial glioblastoma multiforme in rats is verified. This self&#8208;powered gas&#8208;therapy system has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment modality to inhibit tumor growth, relapse, and invasion via teletherapy.

Herein, an integrated, self-powered, and wirelessly controlled gas-therapy system is reported, which is composed of a self-powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an implantable nitric oxide (NO) releasing device for intracranial neuroglioma therapy. In the system, the patient self-driven TENG converts the mechanical energy of body movements into electricity as a sustainable and self-controlled power source. When delivering energy to light a&#160;light-emitting diode&#160;in the implantable NO releasing device via wireless control, the encapsulated NO donor s-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can generate NO gas to locally kill the glioma cells. The efficacy of the proof-of-concept system in subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer model in mice and intracranial glioblastoma multiforme in rats is verified. This self-powered gas-therapy system has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment modality to inhibit tumor growth, relapse, and invasion via teletherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;change Perovskite Microlaser with Tunable Polarization Vortex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metasurfaces supporting optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) are emerging as simple and compact optical cavities to realize polarization&#8208;vortex lasers. The winding of the polarization around the singularity defines topological charges which are generally set by the cavity design and cannot be altered without changing geometrical parameters. Here we demonstrate a subwavelength&#8208;thin phase&#8208;change halide perovskite BIC metasurface functioning as a tunable polarization vortex microlaser. Upon the perovskite structural phase transitions, both its refractive index and gain vary substantially, inducing reversible and bistable switching between distinct polarization vortexes underpinned by opposite topological charges. Dynamic tuning and switching of the resulting vector beams may find use in microscopy imaging, particle trapping and manipulation, and optical data storage.

         <title>Actively&#8208;Triggerable Metals via Liquid Metal Embrittlement for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Actively&#8208;triggerable materials, which break down upon introduction of an exogenous stimulus, enable precise control over the lifetime of biomedical technologies as well as adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, such as changes to an established treatment plan. Yet most actively&#8208;triggerable materials are low&#8208;strength polymers and hydrogels with limited long&#8208;term durability. By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively&#8208;triggerable metals, we leveraged a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, we demonstrate that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically&#8208;relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure. Finally, we demonstrate three possible use cases of biomedical devices constructed from actively&#8208;triggerable metals.

         <title>Direct Observation of Self&#8208;Hybridized Exciton&#8208;Polaritons and Their Valley Polarizations in a Bare WS2 Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized exciton&#8208;polaritons in a bare WS2 layer is reported. The polariton emission is demonstrated to be controllable by varying the thickness of the sample or excitation power. It is also shown that the polariton inherits the valley degree of freedom from excitons and exhibits high valley polarization (Pv =&#160;0.18) at room temperature.








Abstract
The strong excitonic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have led to the successful demonstration of exciton&#8208;polaritons (EPs) in various optical cavity structures. Recently, self&#8208;hybridized EPs have been discovered in a bare TMD layer, but experimental investigation is still lacking because of their nonradiative nature. Herein, the direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized EPs in a bare multilayer WS2 via the evanescent field coupling technique is reported. Because of the thickness&#8208;dependent Rabi splitting energy, the dispersion curves of the EPs change sensitively with sample thickness. Moreover, continuous tuning of EP dispersion curves is demonstrated by controlling the excitation laser power. Lastly, it is observed that guided EPs retain valley polarization up to 0.2 at room temperature, representing a valley&#8208;preserved strong coupling regime. It is believed that the high tunability and valley polarization properties of the guided EPs in bare TMD layers can facilitate new nanophotonic and valleytronic applications.

         <title>Visualized Gallium/Lyticase&#8208;Integrated Antifungal Strategy for Fungal Keratitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible gallium&#8208;based antifungal strategy (MLPGa), integrating lyticase and Ga ions, is&#160;developed for effective fungal keratitis treatment, which can degrade the permeation barrier of exopolysaccharides, then eradicate Candida albicans and biofilms through the mechanisms of extracellular polysaccharide degradation, intrinsic reactive oxygen production, and metabolic interference under Raman/PA bimodal imaging monitors.








Abstract
Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in the fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, lyticase and gallium ions co&#8208;integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) are presented that can degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both planktonic Candida albicans and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and metabolic interference of antioxidant&#8208;related genes, exopolysaccharide&#8208;related genes, iron&#8208;ion&#8208;utilization&#8208;related genes, fungal/biofilm&#8208;development&#8208;related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between the nanosystems and the gallium ions provide a real&#8208;time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa&#8208;based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy: An Abundance of Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy has emerged as a highly sensitive tool for detecting and monitoring the constituents of molecular systems. This review showcases a variety of metaresonator sensors based on different resonance principles, geometries, and materials. The unique functionalities they offer for molecular studies, including dielectrophoresis&#8208;based cell trapping and sensing, as well as AI&#8208;augmented monitoring of biomolecular systems are discussed.








Abstract
Infrared spectroscopy provides unique information on the composition and dynamics of biochemical systems by resolving the characteristic absorption fingerprints of their constituent molecules. Based on this inherent chemical specificity and the capability for label&#8208;free, noninvasive, and real&#8208;time detection, infrared spectroscopy approaches have unlocked a plethora of breakthrough applications&#160;for fields ranging from environmental monitoring and defense to chemical analysis and medical diagnostics. Nanophotonics has played a crucial role for pushing the sensitivity limits of traditional far&#8208;field spectroscopy by using resonant nanostructures to focus the incident light into nanoscale hot&#8208;spots of the electromagnetic field, greatly enhancing light&#8211;matter interaction. Metasurfaces composed of regular arrangements of such resonators further increase the design space for tailoring this nanoscale light control both spectrally and spatially, which has established them as an invaluable toolkit for surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy. Starting from the fundamental concepts of metasurface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy, a broad palette of resonator geometries, materials, and arrangements for realizing highly sensitive metadevices is showcased, with a special focus on emerging systems such as phononic and 2D&#160;van der Waals materials, and integration with waveguides for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, advanced sensor functionalities of metasurface&#8208;based infrared spectroscopy, including multiresonance, tunability, dielectrophoresis, live cell sensing, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided analysis are highlighted.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Cascade Responsive Nanoparticles Enhance Pancreatic Cancer Therapy by Eliminating Tumor&#8208;Resident Intracellular Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticles, consisting of a hyaluronic acid shell and a core assembled by an antibacterial polymer, are proposed. The nanoparticles sequentially trigger active tumor targeting, deep tumor penetration, efficient killing of intratumoral bacteria, and controlled drug release. The nanoparticles augment anticancer efficacy by eliminating tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria via non&#8208;antibiotic therapy.








Abstract
The limited drug penetration and robust bacteria&#8208;mediated drug inactivation in pancreatic cancer result in the failure of chemotherapy. To fight against these issues, a dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticle (sNP@G/IR) that can sequentially trigger deep penetration, killing of intratumor bacteria, and controlled release of chemo&#8208;drug, is reported. sNP@G/IR consists of a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;core (NP@G/IR), that encapsulates gemcitabine (Gem) and photothermal agent (IR1048). The polymer core, as an antibiotic alternative, is tailored to exert optimal antibacterial activity and selectivity. sNP@G/IR actively homes in on the tumor due to the CD44 targeting of the HA shell, which is subsequently degraded by the hyaluronidase in the extracellular matrix. The resultant NP@G/IR in decreased size and reversed charge facilitates deep tumor penetration. After cellular endocytosis, the exposed guanidine on NP@G/IR kills intracellular bacteria through disrupting cell membranes. Intracellular GSH further triggers the controlled release of the&#160;cargo. Thus, the protected Gem eventually induces cell apoptosis. Under laser irradiation, the hyperthermia of IR1048 helps further elimination of tumors and bacteria. Moreover, sNP@G/IR activates immune response, thereby reinforcing anticancer capacity. Therefore, this dual&#8208;cascade responsive sNP@G/IR eliminates tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria and augments drug delivery efficacy, providing a new avenue for improving cancer therapy.

         <title>Simultaneously Stabilizing Both Electrodes and Electrolytes by a Self&#8208;Separating Organometallics Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries at Wide Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aid of electrochemical evolution of an organometallic compound, a self&#8208;separating interface layer for Zn anodes is designed, which can promote the electrode and electrolyte stability simultaneously. The interface with a polymeric C4N3 skeleton and cations homogenizes the Zn2+ flux, induces planar deposition, and maintain cathode stability, leading to high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are of great potential as one of the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices due to their low cost and high safety. However, the development of long&#8208;term stable electrodes and electrolytes still suffers from great challenges. Herein, a self&#8208;separation strategy is developed for an interface layer design to optimize both electrodes and electrolytes simultaneously. Specifically, the coating with an organometallics (sodium tricyanomethanide) evolves into an electrically responsive shield layer composed of nitrogen, carbon&#8208;enriched polymer network, and sodium ions, which not only modulates the zinc&#8208;ion migration pathways to inhibit interface side reactions but also adsorbs onto Zn perturbations to induce planar zinc deposition. Additionally, the separated ions from the coating can diffuse to the electrolyte to affect the Zn2+ solvation structure and maintain the cathode structural stability by forming a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface and sodium ions&#8217; equilibrium, confirmed by in situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. Due to these unique advantages, the symmetric zinc batteries exhibit an extralong cycling lifespan of 3000&#160;h and rate performance at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at wide temperatures. The efficiency of the self&#8208;separation strategy is further demonstrated in practical full batteries with an ultralong lifespan over 10&#160;000 cycles from &#8722;35 to 60 &#176;C.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble AIEgen for Noninvasive Diagnosis of Kidney Fibrosis via SWIR Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembly nanoprobe, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, showing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics is elaborately designed and amenable to longitudinal visualization of the fibrosis progression, specifically 1 week of modeling, via short&#8208;wave infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The high renal clearance efficiency, outstanding imaging performance, and good biocompatibility together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive for renal fibrosis detection in preclinical settings.








Abstract
Early diagnosis of renal fibrosis is crucially significant on account of its worldwide prevalent tendency. Optical imaging in the near&#8208;infrared window has been recognized as an appealing technique for the timely detection of renal dysfunction. However, formulating a contrast agent that allows early monitoring of renal fibrosis and concurrently renally clearable in a normal group is still challenging. Herein, a nanosized fluorophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, is well&#8208;tailored and amenable to longitudinal visualization of the fibrosis progression specifically in the early&#8208;stage via short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The small size (&#8776;26&#160;nm), renally filtrable molecular weight (3.3&#160;kDa), high renal clearance efficiency (93.1 &#177; 1.7% excretion through the kidneys within 24&#160;h), outstanding imaging performance, and good biocompatibility, together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive and far superior to clinical diagnostic assays. The finding in this study would provide a blueprint for the next generation of diagnostic agents for the extent of renal fibrosis.

         <title>Spontaneous Interface Healing by a Dynamic Liquid&#8208;Crystal Transition for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) molecules interacting with PbI2 retard the crystallization of the perovskite film, and finally increase the grain size. During annealing, the LC molecules undergo a phase transition, and then the flowable LC is extracted by the lower interface to release the residual stress, and accelerate electron extraction. A new engineering of additive phase transition is thus conceived.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature solution processing of thin&#8208;film semiconductors is more cost&#8208;effective than traditional vacuum processing; however, it leads to more defects during fast bulk crystallization and residual tensile stress. Herein, a new strategy of dynamic liquid&#8208;crystal transition (DLCT) is developed to solve these problems in one step. The design principle is used to suggest that the DLCT molecule should firstly interact with the perovskite grains in the bulk and meanwhile go through a dynamic transition to spontaneously heal the interface. A thermotropic LC molecule (CBO6SS6OCB) is then designed to demonstrate the strategy. The LC interacting with perovskite colloid forms an intermediate adduct to retard the crystallization. The annealing processes stimulate the concentrated LC solid, causing it to flow to the electron transport layer to release the residual stress to attain improved electron extraction. Consequently, the device efficiency is increased to 24.38%, where its VOC of 1.184&#160;V is among the best for the formamidine&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the ambient stability (93.0% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of aging) and light stability (96.3% of initial efficiency after 500&#160;h of aging) are much improved. This work conceives a new engineering of additive phase transition for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles with SHP2 High Expression Promote Mitophagy for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2) is developed. MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates apoptosis, oxidation, and neuroinflammation, accompanied by rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in AD.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, a platform for AD therapy is developed using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2). The high blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 is demonstrated in AD&#8208;mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. The EV&#8208;engineering technology provides a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.

The high blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC-EVs-SHP2 is demonstrated in AD-mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC-EVs-SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. The EV-engineering technology provides a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vertical Growth of 2D Covalent Organic Framework Nanoplatelets on a Macroporous Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrode with tailor&#8208;made hierarchical pores spanning from nanometer to millimeter scale is fabricated by in&#160;situ growth vertically aligned covalent organic framework nanoplatelets on graphene aerogel. This electrode exhibits an integration of high energy density and high power density as well as good cyclic stability in flexible supercapacitor devices.








Abstract
Hierarchically structural engineering of electrodes is critical to achieving high energy density and high power density in electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, rational regulation of the mesoscopic structure that coordinates microscopic and macroscopic structural features simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Here, the construction of electrodes with well&#8208;defined hierarchical pores spanning multiple length scales from 1&#160;nm to 50&#160;&#181;m is reported. Vertically aligned 2D covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatelets with a thickness around 30&#160;nm are in&#160;situ grown on macroporous graphene aerogel scaffold by a reversible polycondensation&#8208;termination strategy. The obtained electrode thus combines abundant accessible active sites and efficient transport expressways for both ions and electrons. When used for supercapacitors, a superior gravimetric capacitance of 289&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;as well as outstanding capacitance retention at both high charge/discharge rates of 77% from 0.5&#160;to 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and high mass loading of 74% from 1.2&#160;to 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;are achieved. Hierarchical engineering of mesostructured 2D COF units on the macroporous scaffold will bring unprecedented structural designability and performance enhancement for EES electrodes.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

Abstract
Leukocytes play a vital role in immune responses, including defending against invasive pathogens, reconstructing impaired tissue, and maintaining immune homeostasis. When the immune system is activated in vivo, leukocytes accomplish a series of orderly and complex regulatory processes, which are essential in the occurrence and control of diseases. While cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases like sepsis are critical medical issues that require urgent settlement plaguing humankind around the world, leukocytes have been shown to largely gather at the focal site and significantly contribute to inflammation and cancer progression. Therefore, the living leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to the innate and specific targeting effect, low immunogenicity, improved therapeutic efficacy, and low reverse effect. In this review, we introduce the recent advances in the development of living leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems including macrophage, neutrophil, and lymphocyte as promising treatment strategies for cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases (e.g., immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and photodynamic therapy). We also discuss the advantages, current challenges, and limitations of the living leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems, as well as provide our perspectives on the future development of precision and targeted therapy in the clinic. Collectively, we expect that such kind of living cell&#8208;based drug delivery system is promising to improve or even revolutionize the treatments of cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases in the clinic

         <title>Catalytic Effects of Electrodes and Electrolytes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Progress and Prospective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with proper catalytic effects are promising in improving the performance of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. To promote the commercialization process of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in the future, the research progress of catalytic effects in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in recent years is reviewed, and the development direction of catalytic effects for next&#8208;generation metal&#8211;sulfur batteries is discussed.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;sulfur (M&#8211;S) batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage devices due to their advantages such as large energy density and the low cost of the raw materials. However, M&#8211;S batteries suffer from many drawbacks. Endowing the electrodes and electrolytes with the proper catalytic activity is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties of M&#8211;S batteries. With regard to the S cathodes, advanced electrode materials with enhanced electrocatalytic effects can capture polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical conversion and, as for the metal anodes, the proper electrode materials can provide active sites for metal deposition to reduce the deposition potential barrier and control the electroplating or stripping process. Moreover, an advanced electrolyte with desirable design can catalyze electrochemical reactions on the cathode and anode in high&#8208;performance M&#8211;S batteries. In this review, recent progress pertaining to the design of advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with the proper catalytic effects is summarized. The current progress of S cathodes and metal anodes in different types of M&#8211;S batteries are discussed and future development directions are described. The objective is to provide a comprehensive review on the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art S cathodes and metal anodes in M&#8211;S batteries and research guidance for future development of this important class of batteries.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Zn&#8211;Air Batteries&#160;with Long Lifetime Enabled by Reconstructed Amorphous Multi&#8208;Metallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air battery&#160;works well at high current densities of 100&#8211;400&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low voltages due to the OER intermediate O* migration from the Ni to the Fe site in a defect&#8208;rich ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide derived by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, helping to break the restriction of the scaling relationship and then resulting in high intrinsic OER activity with a theoretical overpotential of 170&#8201;mV.








Abstract
Developing fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries is crucial for widening their application but remains challenging owing to the limitation of sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and insufficient active sites of electrocatalysts. To solve this issue, a reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high density of efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255, and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100, and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, is developed for fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8&#160;mAh (20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi&#8208;solid Zn&#8211;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8722;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The detailed characterizations combine with density functional theory calculations indicate that the defect&#8208;rich crystalline/amorphous ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide forms by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi&#8208;active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to the Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast&#8208;charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self&#8208;reconstruction of the pre&#8208;catalyst but also pioneers a pathway for practical fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries.

To solve this issue, a reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiS&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalyst with high density of efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255, and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100, and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, is developed for fast-charging Zn&#8211;air batteries with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8&#160;mAh (20&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi-solid Zn&#8211;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8722;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The detailed characterizations combine with density functional theory calculations indicate that the defect-rich crystalline/amorphous ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide forms by the reconstruction of amorphous multi-metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi-active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to the Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast-charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self-reconstruction of the pre-catalyst but also pioneers a pathway for practical fast-charging Zn&#8211;air batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum Advantage in a Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule&#8208;based engines with a quantum advantage are implemented using spin electronics to harvest the most basic form of energy: ambient heat. This ground&#8208;breaking interdisciplinary approach enables electrical output above room temperature using nanoscale electrical devices. This opens quantum technologies and spintronics toward disruptive energy applications, as a possible technological game&#8208;changer to help mitigate the energy/climate crises.








Abstract
Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous is proposed. The spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co center of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron&#8208;spin&#8208;selecting Fe/C60 interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C60 interface are measured. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built&#8208;in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic&#8208;based information technology chain, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy.

         <title>Anharmonic Cation&#8211;Anion Coupling Dynamics Assisted Lithium&#8208;Ion Diffusion in Sulfide Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By comparing the anharmonic phonon coupling calculations with the ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, this study unveils a unique phenomenon in sulfide solid electrolytes in comparison with halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors often show higher Li&#8208;ion conductivity than other types of electrolyte materials. This work unveils a unique Li&#8208;ion conductive behavior in these materials through the perspective of anharmonic coupling assisted Li&#8208;ion diffusion. Li hopping events can happen simultaneously with various types of lattice dynamics, while only a statistically important synchronization of motions may indicate coupling. This method enables a direct evaluation of the coupling strength between these motions, which more fundamentally decides if a specific type of lattice motion is really anharmonically coupled to the Li hopping event and whether the coupling can facilitate the Li diffusion. By a new ab initio computational approach, this work unveils a unique phenomenon in prototype sulfide electrolytes in comparison with typical halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing phonon modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes. The coupling pushes Li ions toward the diffusion channels for reduced diffusion barriers. The result from the lower temperature range (&#8776;0&#8211;300 K) of simulation can also be more relevant to the application of solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Partially Solvating Diluent for Lithium/Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte employing partially solvating monofluorobenzene as the diluent is developed for Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries. Benefiting from the stable interphases simultaneously formed on both the anode and cathode, dendrite&#8208;free cycling of lithium&#8208;metal anodes with high Coulombic efficiency and highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells with low lithium&#8208;metal excess have been achieved.








Abstract
The development of Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries requires electrolytes that can form stable electrolyte/electrode interphases simultaneously on lithium&#8208;metal anodes (LMAs) and SPAN cathodes. Herein, a low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (LCILE) employing monofluorobenzene (mFBn) as the diluent is proposed for Li/SPAN cells. Unlike non&#8208;solvating diluents in other LCILEs, mFBn partially solvates Li+, decreasing the coordination between Li+ and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;). In turn, this triggers a more substantial decomposition of FSI&#8722; and consequently results in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in inorganic compounds, which enables a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (99.72%) of LMAs. Meanwhile, a protective cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), derived mainly from FSI&#8722; and organic cations, is generated on the SPAN cathodes, preventing the dissolution of polysulfides. Benefiting from the robust interphases simultaneously formed on both the electrodes, a highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells for 250 cycles with a capacity retention of 71% is achieved employing the LCILE and only 80% lithium&#8208;metal excess.

         <title>Pd&#8211;Sb Rhombohedra with an Unconventional Rhombohedral Phase as a Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra&#160;with exposed (003) facets are successfully prepared and applied as highly efficient trifunctional catalysts. The specific ordered arrangement of Pd and Sb atoms on the Pd20Sb7(003) facet not only lowers the oxygen binding energy to an optimal value for the oxygen reduction reaction, but also reduces CO binding for superior resistance to CO poisoning during the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering is an important strategy for designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts with optimized activity and stability. From the thermodynamic point of view, it remains a great challenge to synthesize unconventional phases of noble metals. Here, a new class of Pd&#8208;based nanostructure with unconventional rhombohedral Pd20Sb7 phase is successfully synthesized. Benefiting from the high proportion of the unique exposed Pd20Sb7 (003) surface, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra display much enhanced ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction performance compared with commercial Pd/C. Moreover, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra are also demonstrated as an effective air cathode in non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8211;air batteries with an overpotential of only 0.24&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique exposed facets of Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra can not only reduce the excessive adsorption of CH3CO* to CH3COOH on Pd for promoting EOR process, but also weaken CO binding and CO poisoning. This work provides a new class of unconventional intermetallic nanomaterials with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ternary Tin (II) Alloy as Hole&#8208;Transport Layer of Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed SnOCl ternary tin (II) alloy as hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells is reported, which results in efficiencies of 23.2% and 26.3% for Sn&#8211;Pb single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells, respectively. Greatly enhanced light stabilities with T87 of &gt;1200 h and 85 &#176;C thermal stability with T85 of &gt;1500 h are achieved by using the SnOCl HTM.








Abstract
Tin&#8211;lead (Sn&#8211;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl is reported as the hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. The solution&#8208;processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure that not only reduces the optical loss of the devices, but also changes grain growth of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#181;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1200&#160;h, and keeps 85% efficiency under 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress for 1500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improves the stabilized efficiencies of single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue to the multicomponent metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.

         <title>Bone&#8208;Adhesive Anisotropic Tough Hydrogel Mimicking Tendon Enthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tendon consists of soft collagen, yet it is mechanically strong and firmly adhered to the bone owing to its hierarchically anisotropic structure and unique tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone integration (enthesis), respectively. Despite the recent advances in biomaterials, hydrogels simultaneously providing tendon&#8208;like high mechanical properties and strong adhesion to bone&#8208;mimicking enthesis is still challenging. Here, we show a strong, stiff, and adhesive triple&#8208;network (TN) anisotropic hydrogel that mimics a bone&#8208;adhering tendon. The tough adhesive TN hydrogel is developed by combining imidazole&#8208;containing polyaspartamide (providing multiple hydrogel bonds to the bone surface) and energy&#8208;dissipative alginate&#8208;polyacrylamide double&#8208;network. To mimic the anisotropic structure and high mechanical properties of tendons, the bone&#8208;adhered TN hydrogel is linearly stretched and subsequently fixed via secondary cross&#8208;linking. The resulting hydrogel exhibits high tensile modulus and strength while maintaining a high bone adhesion without chemical modification of the bone surface. Furthermore, a bone&#8208;ligament&#8208;bone structure with strong bone adhesion reminiscent of the natural ligament is realized.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nano&#8208;Optogenetic Activation of Cancer Immunotherapy via Engineered Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Certain anaerobic microbes with the capability to colonize in tumor microenvironment tend to express the heterologous gene in a sustainable manner, which would inevitably comprise the therapeutic efficacy and induce off&#8208;tumor toxicity in vivo. To improve the therapeutic precision and controllability of bacteria&#8208;based therapeutics, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) engineered to sense blue light and release the encoded flagellin B (flaB), is conjugated with lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nano&#8208;optogenetic cancer immunotherapy. Upon 808&#160;nm photoirradiation, UCNPs emit at the blue region to photoactivate the EcN for secretion of flaB, which subsequently binds to Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 expressed on the membrane of macrophages for activating immune response via MyD88&#8208;dependent signal pathway. Such synergism leads to significant tumor regression in different tumor models and metastatic tumors with negligible side effects. Our studies based on NIR nano&#8208;optogenetic platform highlight the rational of leveraging the optogenetic tools combined natural propensity of certain bacteria for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Surface Roughness&#8208;induced Plasticity (SRIP) in a Biodegradable Zn Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Improving plasticity has been an eternal theme of developing metallic materials. It is difficult to increase room temperature elongation of metallic materials over 100% without sacrificing strength using existing methods. Herein, surface roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) is discovered in biodegradable Zn&#8208;0.4Mn alloy. Surprisingly, in the good surface range that meets the international standard ISO 6892, reducing surface roughness results in significant increase in plasticity without loss of strength. From unground to 5000# sandpaper ground states, surface roughness Ra of the alloy decreases from 0.63 &#956;m to 0.05 &#956;m, while its room temperature elongation increases from 74% to 143%. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness. It provides a new method for improving plasticity.

         <title>Sulfonium Cations Assisted Intermediate Engineering for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quasi two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites with superior stability are admirable candidates for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) towards commercialization. However, the device performance remains unsatisfactory due to the disordered crystallization of perovskites. In this work, we investigate the effects of sulfonium cations on the evolution of intermediates and photovoltaic properties of 2D RP perovskites. The introduction of sulfonium cations leads to preferred intermediate transformation and improved film quality of perovskites. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 19.08% at room temperature and 20.52% at 180 K, due to reduced recombination and enhanced charge transport. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 84% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 40&#176;C for 1000&#160;h. This work helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the crystallization process of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites and provides a simple strategy to modulate the intermediates of perovskites.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymer Coordinated Single Co Site Nanofibers for Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Cathodes in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;cobalt&#8208;atom electrocatalysts, particularly ones derived from high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have emerged as a new frontier in the design of oxygen reduction cathodes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to their enhanced durability and smaller Fenton effects related to the degradation of membranes and ionomers compared with emphasized iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, pyrolysis techniques lead to obscure active&#8208;site configurations, undesirably defined porosity and morphology, and fewer exposed active sites. Herein, a highly stable cross&#8208;linked nanofiber electrode was directly prepared by electrospinning using a liquid processability cobalt&#8208;based covalent organic polymer (Co&#8208;COP) obtained via pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The resultant fibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a uniform hierarchical porous texture and a full dispersion of atomic Co active sites on the catalyst surface. Focused ion beam&#8208;field emission scanning electron microscopy and computational fluid dynamics experiments confirmed that the relative diffusion coefficient was enhanced by 3.5 times, which can provide an efficient route both for reactants to enter the active sites, and drain away the produced water efficiently. As a result, the peak power density of the integrated Co&#8208;COP nanofiber electrode was remarkably enhanced by 1.72 times along with significantly higher durability compared with conventional spraying methods. Notably, this nanofabrication technique also maintains excellent scalability and uniformity, which are desired characteristics for assisting in membrane electrode assembly manufacturing for PEMFCs.

As a result, the peak power density of the integrated Co-COP nanofiber electrode was remarkably enhanced by 1.72 times along with significantly higher durability compared with conventional spraying methods. Notably, this nanofabrication technique also maintains excellent scalability and uniformity, which are desired characteristics for assisting in membrane electrode assembly manufacturing for PEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boosting Perovskite Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability: Interfacial Passivation of Crosslinked Fullerene Eliminates the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; Decay</title>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) longevity is nowadays the bottleneck for their full commercial exploitation. Although lot of research is ongoing, the initial decay of the output power &#8211; an effect known as &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation happening in the first hundred hours &#8211; is still unavoidable, significantly reducing the overall performance (typically of more than 20%). In this paper, we demonstrate the origin of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs which is directly related to Li+ ions migration coming from the SnO2 electron transporting layer visualize by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) measurements. To block the ion movement, we introduced a thin crosslinked PC61BM (CL&#8208;PCBM) layer on top of the SnO2 layer, resulting in Li+ immobilization. This resulted in the elimination of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation, showing for the first time a zero &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; loss in the performances while boosting device PCE to &gt; 22% for triple&#8208;cation based PSCs and &gt; 24% for formamidinium&#8208;based (FAPbI3) PSCs, proving the general validity of our approach and creating a new framework for the realization of stable PSCs devices.

         <title>Pt single Atoms on CrN Nanoparticles Deliver Outstanding Activity and CO Tolerance in the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells is currently hampered by high cost of commercial Pt catalysts and their susceptibility to poisoning by CO impurities in H2 feed. In this context, the development of CO&#8208;tolerant electrocatalysts with high Pt atom utilization efficiency for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of critical importance. Herein, Pt single atoms were successfully immobilized on chromium nitride nanoparticles by atomic layer deposition method, denoted as Pt SACs/CrN. Electrochemical tests established Pt SACs/CrN to be a very efficient HOR catalyst, with a mass activity that was 5.7 times higher than commercial PtRu/C. Strikingly, the excellent performance of Pt SACs/CrN was maintained after introducing 1000&#160;ppm of CO in H2 feed. The excellent CO&#8208;tolerance of Pt SACs/CrN is related to weaker CO adsorption on Pt single atoms. This work provides guidelines for the design and construction of active and CO&#8208;tolerant catalysts for HOR.

         <title>Energy and Space Efficient Parallel Adder Using Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Breakthrough in the in&#8208;memory computing technologies hinges on the development of appropriate material platforms that can overcome their existing limitations such as larger than optimal footprint and multiple serial computational steps, with potential accumulation of errors. We show that by using a molecular switching element with multiple non&#8208;monotonic and deterministic transitions, the device count and the number of computational steps can be substantially reduced. With molecular materials, however, the realization of a reliable and robust platform has been an unattained goal for decades. Here, we fabricated crossbar arrays with up to 64 molecular memristors and experimentally demonstrated 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders that operated for thousands of measurement cycles with an estimated error probability of 10&#8722;16. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit parallel adder was designed and simulated with 260 million inputs including contributions from the peripheral circuitry showing a 47&#215; higher energy efficiency, 93&#215; faster operation, and 9% of the footprint, leading to 4390 times improved energy&#8208;delay product compared to a special purpose CMOS based multicore adder.

         <title>Ferrielectricity in the Archetypal Antiferroelectric, PbZrO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Antiferroelectric materials, where the transition between antipolar and polar phase is controlled by external electric fields, offer exceptional energy storage capacity with high efficiencies, giant electrocaloric effect, and superb electromechanical response. PbZrO3 is the first discovered and the archetypal antiferroelectric material. Nonetheless, substantial challenges in processing phase pure PbZrO3 have limited studies of the undoped composition, hindering understanding of the phase transitions in this material or unraveling the controversial origins of a low&#8208;field ferroelectric phase observed in lead zirconate thin films. Leveraging highly oriented PbZrO3 thin films, a room temperature ferrielectric phase is observed in absence of external electric fields, with modulations of amplitude and direction of the spontaneous polarization and large anisotropy for critical electric fields required for phase transition. The ferrielectric state observations are qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions, and correlate with very high dielectric tunability, and ultra&#8208;high strains (up to 1.1%). This work suggests a need for re&#8208;evaluation of the fundamental science of antiferroelectricity in this archetypal&#160;material.

         <title>Lymph Node Targeted Drug Delivery for Effective Immunomodulation to Prolong the Long&#8208;Term Survival After Heart Transplantation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The chronic rejection responses and side effects of systematic administration of immunosuppressants are the main obstacles for heart allograft and patient survival. The development of xenotransplantation also urgently requires more efficient immune regulation strategies. Herein, we demonstrate that lymph node (LN) targeted drug delivery can realize LN specific immunomodulation with attenuated immune suppression on distant peripheral immune organs to effectively prolong the long&#8208;term survival after heart transplantation in a chronic murine heart transplantation model. A chemokine C&#8208;C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) specific aptamer for LN targeting is decorated onto the surface of the hybrid nanoparticular delivery vector composed of CaCO3/CaP/heparin. The targeting delivery system can dramatically enhance accumulation of the loaded immunosuppressant, FTY720, in draining lymph nodes (dLNs) for inducing powerful immune suppression. Through promoting the generation of endogenous regulatory T cells and decreasing the proportion of effector T cells in dLNs after heart transplantation, our LN targeting strategy can effectively regulate local immune responses instead of the systemic immunity, which reduces the incidence of long&#8208;term complications. This study provides an efficient strategy to improve the survival rate after organ transplantation by precise and localized immunoregulation with minimized side effects of immunosuppression.

         <title>When Chirophotonic Film Meets Wrinkles: Viewing Angle Independent Corrugated Photonic Crystal Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light manipulation strategies of nature have fascinated humans for centuries. In particular, structural colors are of considerable interest due to their ability to control the interaction between light and matter. Here, wrinkled photonic crystal papers (PCPs) is fabricated to demonstrate the consistent reflection of colors regardless of viewing angles. We combined the nanoscale molecular self&#8208;assembly of a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) with a microscale corrugated surface. Fully polymerizable CLC paints were uniaxially coated onto a wrinkled interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) substrate. Photopolymerization of the helicoidal nanostructures resulted in a flexible and free&#8208;standing PCP. The facile method of fabricating the wrinkled PCPs provide a scalable route for the development of novel chirophotonic materials with precisely controlled helical pitch and curvature dimensions. The reflection notch position of the flat PCP shifts to a lower wavelength when the viewing angle increased, while the selective reflection wavelength of wrinkled PCP was remained consistent regardless of viewing angles. The optical reflection of the 1D stripe wrinkled PCP is dependent on the wrinkle direction. PCPs with different corrugated directions can be patterned to reduce the angular&#8208;dependent optical reflection of wrinkles. Furthermore, we successfully developed 2D wavy wrinkled PCP that exhibit directionally independent reflection of color.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light manipulation strategies of nature have fascinated humans for centuries. In particular, structural colors are of considerable interest due to their ability to control the interaction between light and matter. Here, wrinkled photonic crystal papers (PCPs) is fabricated to demonstrate the consistent reflection of colors regardless of viewing angles. We combined the nanoscale molecular self-assembly of a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) with a microscale corrugated surface. Fully polymerizable CLC paints were uniaxially coated onto a wrinkled interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) substrate. Photopolymerization of the helicoidal nanostructures resulted in a flexible and free-standing PCP. The facile method of fabricating the wrinkled PCPs provide a scalable route for the development of novel chirophotonic materials with precisely controlled helical pitch and curvature dimensions. The reflection notch position of the flat PCP shifts to a lower wavelength when the viewing angle increased, while the selective reflection wavelength of wrinkled PCP was remained consistent regardless of viewing angles. The optical reflection of the 1D stripe wrinkled PCP is dependent on the wrinkle direction. PCPs with different corrugated directions can be patterned to reduce the angular-dependent optical reflection of wrinkles. Furthermore, we successfully developed 2D wavy wrinkled PCP that exhibit directionally independent reflection of color.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multifunctional 4D&#8208;Printed Sperm&#8208;Hybrid Microcarriers for Assisted Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4D&#8208;printed microcarriers are developed to perform various functions, including multiple sperm cargo&#8208;release, local sperm capacitation, and mediation of cumulus&#8211;oocyte complex removal by in situ enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Remotely controllable microrobots are appealing for various biomedical in vivo applications. In particular, in recent years, our&#160;group has focused on developing sperm&#8208;microcarriers to assist sperm cells with motion deficiencies or low sperm count (two of the most prominent male infertility problems) to reach the oocyte toward in&#8208;vivo&#8208;assisted fertilization. Different sperm carriers, considering their motion in realistic media and confined environments, have been optimized. However, the already&#8208;reported sperm carriers have been mainly designed to transport single sperm cell, with limited functionality. Thus, to take a step forward, here, the development of a 4D&#8208;printed multifunctional microcarrier containing soft and smart materials is reported. These microcarriers can not only transport and deliver multiple motile sperm cells, but also release heparin and mediate local enzymatic reactions by hyaluronidase&#8208;loaded polymersomes (HYAL&#8208;Psomes). These multifunctional facets enable in situ sperm capacitation/hyperactivation, and the local degradation of the cumulus complex that surrounds the oocyte, both to facilitate the sperm&#8211;oocyte interaction for the ultimate goal of in vivo assisted fertilization.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dendrimersomes: A Closer Xenobiotic Mimic of Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphocholine&#8208;based Janus dendrimer is reported, which lacks the &#8220;weak points&#8221; that result in the chemical and physical instability of natural liposomes. Despite their synthetic nature, the resulting self&#8208;assembled dendrimersomes recapitulate the most important physical properties of cell membranes. This enables functionalization with natural functional molecules as well as mimicry of cellular functions on a basic level.








Abstract
Building functional mimics of cell membranes is an important task toward the development of synthetic cells. So far, lipid and amphiphilic block copolymers are the most widely used amphiphiles with the bilayers by the former lacking stability while membranes by the latter are typically characterized by very slow dynamics. Herein, a new type of Janus dendrimer containing a zwitterionic phosphocholine hydrophilic headgroup (JDPC) and a 3,5&#8208;substituted dihydrobenzoate&#8208;based hydrophobic dendron is introduced. JDPC self&#8208;assembles in water into zwitterionic dendrimersomes (z&#8208;DSs) that faithfully recapitulate the cell membrane in thickness, flexibility, and fluidity, while being resilient to harsh conditions and displaying faster pore closing dynamics in the event of membrane rupture. This enables the fabrication of hybrid DSs with components of natural membranes, including pore&#8208;forming peptides, structure&#8208;directing lipids, and glycans to create raft&#8208;like domains or onion vesicles. Moreover, z&#8208;DSs can be used to create active synthetic cells with life&#8208;like features that mimic vesicle fusion and motility as well as environmental sensing. Despite their fully synthetic nature, z&#8208;DSs are minimal cell mimics that can integrate and interact with living matter with the programmability to imitate life&#8208;like features and beyond.

         <title>Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell Toward Superior Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ is modified by 2&#8208;propanol to form a eutectic solvation shell, which can promote the oriented deposition of Zn metal and great desolvation kinetics of Zn2+. Attributed to its new outer solvation structure design, fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;term cycling capability of Zn&#8208;ion batteries under extreme temperature operation condition are achieved.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are well regarded among a next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, it is demonstrated that the addition of 2&#8208;propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500&#160;h under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance is achieved in a 150&#160;mAh Zn|V2O5 pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.

         <title>Isolating Contiguous Ir Atoms and Forming Ir&#8211;W Intermetallics with Negatively Charged Ir for Efficient NO Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst (IrW&#8208;WO3/KIT&#8208;6) containing only 1&#160;wt% Ir is synthesized for efficient catalytic reduction of NO by CO to N2 under O2&#8208;containing conditions. This catalyst consists of ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6) supported with WO3 nanoparticles, and the latter is covered with atomic&#8208;dispersed IrW intermetallics.








Abstract
The lack of efficient catalysts with a wide working temperature window and vital O2 and SO2 resistance for selective catalytic reduction of NO by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) largely hinders its implementation. Here, a novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst with only 1&#160;wt% Ir loading is reported for efficient CO&#8208;SCR. In this catalyst, contiguous Ir atoms are isolated into single atoms, and Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles are formed, which are supported on ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6). Notably, this catalyst enables complete NO conversion to N2 at 250&#160;&#176;C in the presence of 1% O2 and has a wide temperature window (250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C), outperforming the comparison samples with Ir isolated&#8208;single&#8208;atomic&#8208;sites and Ir nanoparticles, respectively. Also, it possesses a high SO2 tolerance. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that single Ir atoms are negatively charged, dramatically enhancing the NO dissociation, while the Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles accelerate the reduction of the N2O and NO2 intermediates by CO.

         <title>Electro&#8211;Chemo&#8211;Mechanical Failure of Solid Electrolytes Induced by Growth of Internal Lithium Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiphysics simulation presents electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid electrolyte caused by internal electroplating of lithium (Li) through visualizing local stress, damage accumulation, and crack propagation.

Growth of lithium (Li) filaments within solid electrolytes, leading to mechanical degradation of the electrolyte and even short circuit of the cell under high current density, is a great barrier to commercialization of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Understanding of this electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical phenomenon is hindered by the challenge of tracking local fields inside the solid electrolyte. Here, a multiphysics simulation aiming to investigate evolution of the mechanical failure of the solid electrolyte induced by the internal growth of Li is reported. Visualization of local stress, damage, and crack propagation within the solid electrolyte enables examination of factors dominating the degradation process, including the geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the&#160;electrolyte. Relative damage induced by locally high stress is found to preferentially occur in the region of the electrolyte/Li interface having great fluctuations. A high number density of Li filaments or voids triggers integration of damage and crack networks by enhanced propagation. This model is built on coupling of mechanical and electrochemical processes for internal plating of Li, revealing evolution of multiphysical fields that can barely be captured by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experimental techniques. Understanding mechanical degradation of solid electrolytes with the presence of Li filaments paves the way to design advanced solid electrolytes for future solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Spectral Indicators of Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven classifier of band topology for a database of over 10&#160;000 compounds using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) features as input, achieving over 90% accuracy is developed. By leveraging the simplicity and versatility of XAS, this classifier has the potential to accelerate the discovery and screening of a much broader category of candidate topological materials.








Abstract
Topological materials discovery has emerged as an important frontier in condensed matter physics. While theoretical classification frameworks have been used to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental determination of materials&#8217; topology often poses significant technical challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely used materials characterization technique sensitive to atoms&#8217; local symmetry and chemical bonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of topological quantum chemistry (TQC). Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS is known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and calculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can effectively inform experiments. In this work, computed X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10&#160;000 inorganic materials to train a neural network (NN) classifier that predicts topological class directly from XANES signatures, achieving F1 scores of 89% and 93% for topological and trivial classes, respectively is leveraged. Given the simplicity of the XAS setup and its compatibility with multimodal sample environments, the proposed machine&#8208;learning&#8208;augmented XAS topological indicator has the potential to discover broader categories of topological materials, such as non&#8208;cleavable compounds and amorphous materials, and may further inform field&#8208;driven phenomena in situ, such as magnetic field&#8208;driven topological phase&#160;transitions.

         <title>Design of Smart Aggregates: Toward Rapid Clinical Diagnosis of Hyperlipidemia in Human Blood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. They can act as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221; and autonomously respond to HLP to realize in vitro detection and in vivo imaging in mice and human blood. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm).








Abstract
Molecular aggregates with environmental responsive properties are desired for their wide practical applications such as bioprobes. Here, a series of smart near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. The aggregates of these molecules exhibit a twisted intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effect in aqueous media, but aggregation&#8208;induced emission in highly viscous media due to the restriction of the intramolecular motion. These aggregates, which can autonomously respond to different environments via switching the aggregation state without changing their chemical structures are described, as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221;. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm). Both in vitro detection and in vivo imaging of HLP can be realized in a mouse model. Linear relationships exist between the emission intensity and multiple pathological parameters in blood samples of HLP patients. Thus, the design of smart aggregate facilitates rapid and accurate detection of HLP and provides a promising attempt in aggregate science.

         <title>Tissue&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Polymer Networks for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Addressing the mechanical mismatch between biological tissue and traditional electronic materials remains a major challenge in bioelectronics. While rigidity of such materials limits biocompatibility, supramolecular polymer networks can harmoniously interface with biological tissues as they are soft, wet and stretchable. Here we&#160;introduce an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network that simultaneously exhibits both electronic and ionic conductivity while maintaining tissue&#8208;mimetic mechanical properties, providing an ideal electronic interface with the human body. Rational design of an ultrahigh affinity host&#8208;guest ternary complex led to binding affinities (&gt;&#160;1013&#160;M&#8208;2) of over an order of magnitude greater than previous reports. Embedding these complexes as dynamic crosslinks, coupled with in&#8208;situ synthesis of a conducting polymer, resulted in electrically conductive supramolecular polymer networks with tissue&#8208;mimetic Young's moduli (&lt;&#160;5&#160;kPa), high stretchability (&gt;&#160;500%), rapid self&#8208;recovery and high water content (&gt;&#160;84%). Achieving such properties enabled fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of accurately monitoring electromyography signals, free from any rigid&#160;materials.

         <title>Locking Active Li Metal through Localized Redistribution of Fluoride Enabling Stable Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The creation of a fluorinated interphase has emerged as an effective strategy for improving Li&#8208;metal anodes for applications in rechargeable high&#8208;energy batteries. In contrast to the introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing species through widely adopted electrolyte engineering (e.g., salt and fluorinated solvent additive), we reported a Li metal composite design in which LiF could locally redistribute on the Li metal surface in liquid electrolytes via a dissolution&#8208;reprecipitation mechanism, and enable the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). For validation, a Li/Li22Sn5/LiF ternary composite was investigated, where the as&#8208;formed LiF&#8208;rich SEI locked the active Li metal from a corrosive electrolyte. The Li/Li22Sn5/LiF anode displayed an impressive average Coulombic efficiency (&#8764;99.2%) at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a carbonate electrolyte and a remarkable cycling life of over 1600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Applied to a LiCoO2 full cell with a high cathode areal capacity of 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, a high capacity retention of &#8764;91.1% was realized for 100 cycles at 0.5 C in a wide potential range between 2.8 to 4.5&#160;V with a low negative/positive ratio of 2:1. This design is conceptually different from the design employing the widely used fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte additive to introduce fluorine species in the SEI and provides an alternative approach to realize reliable Li metal batteries.

Abstract
The lack of safe and efficient hydrogen storage is a major bottleneck for large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen energy. Reversible hydrogen storage of light&#8208;weight metal hydrides with high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density is one ideal solution but requires extremely high operating temperature with large energy input. Herein, taking MgH2 as an example, we demonstrate a concept to achieve solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets (Cu@MXene). The photothermal effect of Cu@MXene, coupled with the &#8220;heat isolator&#8221; role of MgH2 indued by its poor thermal conductivity, effectively elevates the temperature of MgH2 upon solar irradiation. The &#8220;hydrogen pump&#8221; effect of Ti and TiHx species that are in&#8208;situ formed on the surface of MXene from the reduction of MgH2, on the other hand, plays a catalytic role in effectively alleviating the kinetic barrier and hence decreasing the operating temperature required for reversible hydrogen adsorption and desorption of MgH2. Based on the combination of photothermal and catalytic effect of Cu@MXene, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt.% is achieved for MgH2 after 30 cycles using solar irradiation as the only energy source.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tunable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Emerging immersive visual communication technologies require light sources with complex functionality for dynamic control of polarization, directivity, wavefront, spectrum, and intensity of light. Currently, this is mostly achieved by free space bulk optic elements, limiting the adoption of these technologies. Flat optics based on artificially structured metasurfaces that operate at the sub&#8208;wavelength scale are a viable solution, however their integration into electrically driven devices remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a radically new approach of monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor. We show that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8&#8208;fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light&#8208;emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.

         <title>A Monolithic Stochastic Computing Architecture for Energy Efficient Arithmetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As the energy and hardware investments necessary for conventional high&#8208;precision digital computing continues to explode in the emerging era of artificial intelligence, deep learning, and big data, a change in paradigm that can trade precision for energy and resource efficiency is being sought for many computing applications. Stochastic computing (SC) is an attractive alternative since unlike digital computers, which require many logic gates and a high transistor volume to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, sorting, etc., SC can implement the same using simple logic gates. While it is possible to accelerate SC using traditional silicon complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the need for extensive hardware investment to generate stochastic bits (s&#8208;bits), the fundamental computing primitive for SC, makes it less attractive. Memristor and spin&#8208;based devices offer natural randomness but depend on hybrid designs involving CMOS peripherals for accelerating SC, which increases area and energy burden. Here, we overcome the limitations of existing and emerging technologies and experimentally demonstrate a standalone SC architecture embedded in memory based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) memtransistors. Our monolithic and non&#8208;von Neumann SC architecture consumes a miniscule amount of energy (&lt; 1 nJ) for both s&#8208;bit generation and arithmetic operations, and it also occupies a small hardware footprint, highlighting the benefits of SC.

         <title>Approaching Bulk Mobility in PbSe Colloidal Quantum dots 3D Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional superlattices made of colloidal quantum dots are a promising candidate for the next generation of optoelectronic devices as they are expected to exhibit a unique combination of tunable optical properties and coherent electrical transport through minibands. While most of the previous work was performed on two&#8208;dimensional arrays, the control over the formation of these systems has been lacking, where limited long&#8208;range order and energetical disorder have so far hindered the potential of these metamaterials, giving rise to disappointing transport properties. Here we report that nanoscale&#8208;level controlled ordering of colloidal quantum dots in three dimensions and over large areas allows achieving outstanding transport properties. The measured electron mobilities are the highest ever reported for a self&#8208;assembled solid of fully quantum&#8208;confined objects. This ultimately demonstrates that optoelectronic metamaterials with highly tunable optical properties (in this case in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared spectral range) and charge mobilities approaching the one of bulk semiconductor can be obtained. This finding paves the way towards a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries possess high potential for grid&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the issues arising from the low S mass loading and poor cycling stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously limit their operating capacity and cycling capability. Herein, sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Mo1 (S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF) with a record high sulfur mass loading of 80.9 wt% were synthesized as an integrated dual active sites cathode for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF displayed unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000 cycles. Experimental and computational results including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that atomic&#8208;level Mo in this integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Fracture along Twin Boundaries in Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic structure of B4C and its fracture behaviors are investigated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected STEM and in situ TEM mechanical testing. The combination of in situ TEM observations and quantum mechanics calculations reveal that amorphous bands and crack initiation occur preferentially at the twin boundaries in B4C under mechanical loading, thus contributing to the failure of B4C.








Abstract
The observation of fracture behaviors in perfect and twinned B4C crystals via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing is reported. The crystal structure of the synthesized B4C, composed of B11C icosahedra connected by boron&#8208;deficient C&#8211;&#9643;&#8211;C chains in a chemical formula of B11C3, is determined by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected scanning TEM. The in situ TEM observations reveal that cracking is preferentially initiated at the twin boundaries (TBs) in B4C under both indentation and tension loading. The cracks then propagate along the TBs, thus resulting in the fracture of B4C. These results are consistent with the theoretical calculations that show that TBs have a softening effect on B4C with amorphous bands preferentially nucleated at the TBs. These findings elucidate the atomic arrangement and the role of planar defects in the failure of B4C. Furthermore, they can guide the design of advanced superhard materials via planar defect control.

         <title>Overcoming the Outcoupling Limit of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Artificially Formed Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Textured perovskite films are formed artificially by controlling the dwell time of the antisolvent. Due to scattering at the textured surface, photons trapped in the waveguide mode can be extracted. Therefore, the external quantum efficiency is boosted significantly from 10% for flat perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to 20.5% for textured PeLEDs with an extraordinarily thick perovskite layer of 1.5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art planar&#8208;structure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is mainly limited by the outcoupling efficiency, which is around 20% and decreases significantly with the perovskite thickness. Here, an approach to artificially form textured perovskite films to boost the outcoupling limit of the PeLEDs is reported. By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film&#8208;forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nm, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 &#181;m. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 &#181;m. This study provides a novel way of forming light&#8208;extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Bithiophene&#8208;Imide&#8208;Based Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM)&#160;PFBTI is successfully developed for PVSCs. The suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, and excellent surface passivation effects endow PFBTI&#8208;based organic/inorganic hybrid PVSCs with a promising PCE of 23.1% and much&#8208;enhanced stability. PFBTI can be further used in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells and achieve high PCEs.








Abstract
The development of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) with high mobility, long&#8208;term stability, and comprehensive passivation is significant for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers PBTI and PFBTI with alternating benzodithiophene (BDT) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units are successfully developed with desirable hole mobilities due to the good planarity and extended conjugation of molecular backbone. Both copolymers can be employed as HTMs with suitable energy levels and efficient defect passivation. Shortening the alkyl chain of the BTI unit and introducing fluorine atoms on the BDT moiety effectively enhances hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the HTMs, leading to improved efficiency and stability of PVSCs. As a result, the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PVSCs with PFBTI as the HTM deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% with enhanced long&#8208;term operational and ambient stability, which is one of the best efficiencies reported for PVSCs with dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTMs to date. Moreover, PFBTI can be applied in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, achieving a high PCE of 17.4% and 22.2%, respectively. These results illustrate the great potential of PFBTI as an efficient and widely applicable HTM for cost&#8208;effective and stable PVSCs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Nanomotors with an Alloyed Engine for Emergency Rescue of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed to construct superactive engines for self&#8208;propulsion of nanomotors under physiological concentration of H2O2. The PtPdMo ternary alloy induced by plasma improves the catalytic activity of the Pt&#8208;based engine, thus promoting movement both in vitro and in vivo and simultaneously achieves nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy in traumatic&#8208;brain&#8208;injury mice.








Abstract
In severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), acute oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades rapidly spread to cause irreversible brain damage and low survival rate within minutes. Therefore, developing a feasible solution for the quick&#8208;treatment of life&#8208;threatening emergency is urgently demanded to earn time for hospital treatment. Herein, Janus catalysis&#8208;driven nanomotors (JCNs) are carefully constructed via plasma&#8208;induced alloying technology and sputtering&#8208;caused half&#8208;coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicate that the heteroatom&#8208;doping alloyed engine endows JCNs with much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species than common Pt&#8208;based engines. When JCNs are dropped to the surface of the ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy. The results demonstrate that the JCNs successfully block the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. This work provides a revolutionary nanomotor&#8208;based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first&#8208;aid scenarios due to their self&#8208;propelled movement combined with highly multienzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.

         <title>3D&#8208;bioprinted Phantom with Human Skin Phototypes for Biomedical Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report 3D&#8208;bioprinted skin&#8208;mimicking phantoms with skin colors ranging across the Fitzpatrick scale. These tools can help understand the impact of skin phototypes on biomedical optics. Synthetic melanin nanoparticles of different sizes (70&#8211;500&#160;nm) and clusters were fabricated to mimic the optical behavior of melanosome. The absorption coefficient and reduced scattering coefficient of the phantoms are comparable to real human skin. We further validated the melanin content and distribution in the phantoms versus real human skins via photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The PA signal of the phantom could be improved by (i) increasing melanin size (3&#8211;450&#8208;fold), (ii) increasing clustering (2&#8211;10.5&#8208;fold), and (iii) increasing concentration (1.3&#8211;8&#8208;fold). We then used multiple biomedical optics tools (e.g., PA, fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapy) to understand the impact of skin tone on these modalities. These well&#8208;defined 3D&#8208;bioprinted phantoms may have value in translating biomedical optics and reducing racial bias.

         <title>Reducing Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells via Extending Fused Ring Donor Unit of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;Type Nonfullerene Acceptor for Over 17% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high trap density (generally 1016&#8211;1018 cm&#8722;3) in thin films of organic semiconductors is the primary reason for the inferior charge carrier mobility and large nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) in organic solar cells (OSCs), limiting improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this study, the trap density in OSCs is efficiently reduced via extending the donor core of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) from heptacyclic unit to nonacyclic unit. TTPIC&#8208;4F with nonacyclic unit has stronger intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, affording higher crystallinity in thin films relative to its counterpart BTPIC&#8208;4F. Thus, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based device achieves a lower trap density of 4.02 &#215; 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, comparable to some typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid semiconductors, with higher mobility and inhibited charge carrier recombination in devices. Therefore, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based OSC exhibits an impressive PCE of 17.1% with a low &#916;Enr of 0.208&#160;eV, which is the best known value for A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type NFAs. Therefore, extending the donor core of NFAs is an efficient method for suppressing trap states in OSCs for high PCEs.

Therefore, the D18:TTPIC-4F-based OSC exhibits an impressive PCE of 17.1% with a low &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.208&#160;eV, which is the best known value for A-D-A-type NFAs. Therefore, extending the donor core of NFAs is an efficient method for suppressing trap states in OSCs for high PCEs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Refining perovskite heterojunctions for effective light&#8208;emitting solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar cells capable of light&#8208;harvesting during daytime and light&#8208;emitting at night are multifunctional semiconductor devices with many potential applications. Here we report that halide perovskite heterojunction interfaces can be refined to yield stable and efficient solar cells. The cell can also operate effectively as an ultralow&#8208;voltage light&#8208;emitting diode with a peak external quantum efficiency of 3.3%. Spectroscopic and microscopic studies reveal that double&#8208;heterojunction refinement with wide&#8208;bandgap salts is key to densifying the packing of perovskite grains and enlarging the bandgaps of the perovskite surfaces that are in contact with charge transport semiconductors. The refined perovskite enables a simple device with dual actions of solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. This type of all&#8208;in&#8208;one device has the potential for multifunctional harvesting&#8208;storage&#8208;utilization systems.

         <title>Triggering ZT to 0.40 by Engineering Orientation in One Polymeric Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Breaking the thermoelectric (TE) trade&#8208;off relationship is a dreaming task for maximizing the TE performance of polymeric semiconductors. Existing efforts have focused on designing high&#8208;mobility semiconductors and achieving ordered molecular doping, ignoring the critical role of the molecular orientation during TE conversion. Herein, we report the achievement of ZT to 0.40 by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular orientation of one diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer (DPP&#8208;BTz). Films with bimodal molecular orientation yield superior doping efficiency by increasing the lamellar spacing and achieve increased splitting between the Fermi energy and the transport energy to enhance the thermopower. These factors contribute to the simultaneous improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity in an unexpected manner. Importantly, the bimodal film exhibited a maximum power factor of up to 346 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, &gt;400% higher than that of unimodal films. These results demonstrate the great potential of molecular orientation engineering in polymeric semiconductors for developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OTE materials.

         <title>Electrolyte for High Energy&#8208; and Power&#8208;density Zinc Batteries and Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dendrites growth, limited coulombic efficiency (CE) and the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes restrict the commercialization of zinc batteries and capacitors. These issues are resolved by a new electrolyte, based on the zinc(II)&#8208;betaine complex [Zn(bet)2][NTf2]2. Solutions in acetonitrile (AN) avoid dendrite formation. A Zn||Zn cell operates stably over 10110 hours (5055 cycles) at 0.2 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 or 110 hours at 50 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2, has an area capacity of 113 mAh&#183;cm&#8211;2 at 80% depth of discharge. A zinc&#8208;graphite battery performs at 2.6 V with a midpoint discharge&#8208;voltage of 2.4 V. The capacity&#8208;retention at 3 A&#183;g&#8722;1 (150C) is 97% after 1000 cycles and 68% after 10000 cycles. The charge/discharge time is about 24 seconds at 3.0 A&#183;g&#8722;1 with an energy density of about 49 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 6864 W&#183;kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode. A zinc activated&#8208;carbon ion&#8208;capacitor (coin cell) exhibits a operating&#8208;voltage window of 2.5 V, an energy density of 96 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 with a power density of 610 W&#183;kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 A&#183;g&#8722;1. At 12 A&#183;g&#8722;1, 36 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 and 13600 W&#183;kg&#8722;1 are achieved with 90% capacity retention and an average CE of 96% over 10000 cycles. Quantum&#8208;chemical methods and vibrational spectroscopy revealed [Zn(bet)2(AN)2]2+ as the dominant complex in the electrolyte.

         <title>Transcranial Non&#8208;genetic Neuromodulation Via Bioinspired Vesicle&#8208;Enabled Precise NIR&#8208;II Optical&#8208;stimulation</title>

Abstract
Regulating the activity of specific neurons is essentially important in neurocircuit dissection and neuropathy therapy. As a recently developed strategy, nanomaterial&#8208;enabled non&#8208;genetic neuromodulations that realize remote physical stimuli have made vast progress and shown great clinical potential. However, minimal invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution are still challenging for non&#8208;genetic neuromodulation. Herein, we report a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light&#8208;induced transcranial non&#8208;genetic neurostimulation via bioinspired nano&#8208;vesicles. The rationally designed vesicles are obtained from vesicle membrane&#8208;confined enzymatic reactions. This study demonstrates that the vesicle&#8208;enabled NIR&#8208;II photothermal stimuli can elicit neuronal signaling dynamics with precise spatiotemporal control and thus evoke defined neural circuits in non&#8208;transgenic mice. Moreover, the vesicle&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II optical stimulation can regulate mouse motor behaviors with minimal invasiveness by eliminating light&#8208;emitting implants. Furthermore, the biological modulation is integrated with photoacoustic brain imaging, realizing navigational and efficient neuromodulation. Such transcranial and precise NIR&#8208;II optical neuromodulation mediated by bioinspired vesicles shows the potential for the optical&#8208;theranostics of neurological diseases in non&#8208;transgenic organisms.

         <title>Taming Solvent&#8211;Solute Interaction Accelerates Interfacial Kinetics in Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries promise energy density beyond 400 Wh kg&#8722;1, while their practical operation at an extreme temperature below &#8722;30&#176;C suffers severe capacity deterioration. Such battery failure highly relates to the remarkably increased kinetic barrier of interfacial processes, including interfacial desolvation, ion transportation, and charge transfer. In this contribution, the interfacial kinetics in three prototypical electrolytes are quantitatively probed by three&#8208;electrode electrochemical techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. Desolvation as the limiting step of interfacial processes is validated to dominate the cell impedance and capacity at low temperature. 1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;based electrolyte with tamed solvent&#8211;solute interaction facilitates fast desolvation, enabling the practical Li | LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cells at &#8722;40&#176;C to retain 66% retention of room&#8208;temperature capacity and withstand remarkably fast charging rate (0.3 C). The barrier of desolvation dictated by solvent&#8211;solute interaction environments has been quantitatively uncovered. Regulating the solvent&#8211;solute interaction by low&#8208;affinity solvents emerges as a promising solution to low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>A Demulsification&#8208;Crystallization Model for High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A room&#8208;temperature technique with all&#8208;nonpolar&#8208;solvent, which circumvents the sensitivity of ionic perovskite to polar solvent, has become attractive for the synthesis of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). However, the lack of understanding of the inner mechanism, especially for the state of the precursor and the crystallization process of the PNCs, hinders further development of this technique. Here, through systematic study of the Pb precursor and in&#8208;situ characterization of the PNCs, we reveal that the reverse micelle nature of the Pb precursor exactly creates a novel demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model, namely, a two&#8208;stage nucleation is divided by a demulsification process for the PNCs. On the basis, a top efficiency for green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on PNCs is obtained with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.5% through tailoring the D&#8211;C model using a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality PNCs. Beyond the high efficiency, our work paves the way for diverse ideas in PNC synthesis.

         <title>Surface Doping Induced Mobility Modulation Effect for Transport Enhancement in Organic Single Crystal Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular doping has conventionally been an effective way to improve the electrical transport performances in organic field effect transistors (OFETs), while corresponding mechanisms associated with specific doping techniques have been less investigated and discussed in detail. Here, based on ultra&#8208;thin DNTT single crystals we realized robust transconductance enhancements in OFETs upon surface molecular doping realized via van der Waals epitaxially growing crystalline F6TCNNQ onto the single crystal's surface. We proposed that, it is the mobility modulation effect (MME) from the interactions between charge transfer interface and gate electric field, that contributes to more weighted bulk carriers, and finally improve charge transport performances. The evaluations were further supported by SKPM's surface potential characterizations, which manifested the gate induced more delocalized holes near the charge transfer interfaces. SCLC investigations, numerical calculations, and theoretical mobility modeling were also performed to corroborate the analysis. This study could deepen the understanding of charge transport in doped semiconductors and provide effective ways for optimizing the electrical performance of organic devices.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer/Perovskite Heterointerfaces for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost. Moreover, the study of hybrid semiconductors would lead to advanced structures and deep understanding that will propel this field even further. Herein, we investigate a novel device architecture involving block copolymer/perovskite hybrid bulk heterointerfaces, such a modification could enhance light absorption, create an energy level cascade and provides a thin hydrophobic layer, thus enabling enhanced carrier generation, promoting energy transfer and preventing moisture invasion, respectively. The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725 cm2&#8208;sized devices and 21.44% for 1 cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI3 and CsPbI3, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.

         <title>Lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 Organic Framework Scintillators Sensitized by Cluster&#8208;based Antenna for High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>

Abstract
Scintillator based X&#8208;ray imaging has attracted great attention from industrial quality inspection and security to medical diagnostics. Herein, a series of lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 heterometallic organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs) based X&#8208;ray scintillators were developed by rationally assembling X&#8208;ray absorption centers ([Cu4I4] clusters) and luminescent chromophores (Ln(III) ions) in a specific manner. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the heavy inorganic units ([Cu4I4] clusters) absorbed the X&#8208;ray energy to populate triplet excitons via the halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (XLCT) combined with metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state (defined X/MLCT state), and then the 3X/MLCT excited state sensitized Tb3+ for intense X&#8208;ray excited luminescence via excitation energy transfer. The obtained Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs scintillators exhibited high resistance to humidity and radiation, excellent linear response to X&#8208;ray dose rate and high X&#8208;ray relative light yield of 29379 &#177; 3000 photons MeV&#8722;1. The relative light yield of Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs was about 3 times higher than that of control Tb(III) complex. X&#8208;ray imaging tests showed that Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs based flexible scintillator film exhibited a high spatial resolution of 12.6 lp mm&#8722;1. These findings not only provided a promising design strategy to develop lanthanide MOFs based scintillators with excellent scintillation performance, but also exhibited high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging for biological specimen and electronic chip.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Halide Exchange of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskites for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites are promising to achieve efficient and bright deep&#8208;blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which is required for lighting and display applications. However, the efficiency of deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskite&#8208;based LEDs is limited by high density of defects in perovskites, and their deep&#8208;blue emission is not easy to achieve due to the halide phase separation and low solubility of chloride in precursor solutions. Here, an in&#8208;situ halide exchange method is developed to achieve deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskites by spin&#8208;coating organic halide salts solution to treat blue 3D perovskites. It is revealed that the halide&#8208;exchange process is mainly determined by halide ion diffusions targeting a concentration equalization, which leads to homogeneous 3D mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. By further introducing multifunctional organic ammonium halide salts into the exchange solution to passivate defects, high&#8208;quality deep&#8208;blue perovskites with reduced trap density can be obtained. This approach leads to efficient deep&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6% and a luminance of 1,680&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), very close to the Rec. 2020 blue standard. Moreover, the halide exchange method is bidirectional, we can achieve blue perovskite LEDs with color coordinates of (0.095, 0.160), exhibiting a high EQE of 11.3%.

However, the efficiency of deep-blue 3D perovskite-based LEDs is limited by high density of defects in perovskites, and their deep-blue emission is not easy to achieve due to the halide phase separation and low solubility of chloride in precursor solutions.

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;Sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germanium oxide can function as a modifier of zeolite crystallization counter to its conventional role as a heteroatom. This effect is observed for two zeolite frameworks wherein GeO2&#160;addition promotes the formation of nano&#8208;sized crystals. Catalytic tests reveal significant enhancement in their performance, suggesting this method can be a commercially viable route to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites.








Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide (GeO2), to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultrasmall dimensions. This effect is observed for zeolites ZSM&#8208;11&#160;and ZSM&#8208;5 over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2&#160;in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2&#160;recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2&#160;compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Advances in Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs and their Prospects for Use in Displays</title>

Abstract
This review outlines problems and progress in development of solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SOLEDs) in industry and academia. Solution processing has several advantages such as low consumption of materials, low&#8208;cost processing, and large&#8208;area manufacturing. However, use of a solution process entails complications, such the needs for solvent resistivity and solution&#8208;processable materials, and yields SOLEDs that have limited luminous efficiency, severe roll&#8208;off characteristics, and short lifetime compared to OLEDs fabricated using thermal evaporation. These demerits impede production of practical SOLED displays. This review outlines the industrial demands for commercial SOLEDs and the current status of SOLED development in industries and academia, and presents research guidelines for development of SOLEDs that have high efficiency, long lifetime, good processability to achieve commercialization.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic States and Tunable Exchange Bias at 3d Nitride Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfacial magnetism stimulates the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and spin&#8208;orbital coupling across the heterointerfaces, facilitating the intimate correlation between spin transport and complex magnetic structures. Over decades, functional heterointerfaces composed of nitrides have been seldomly explored due to the difficulty in synthesizing high&#8208;quality nitride films with correct compositions. Here we report the fabrication of single&#8208;crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films with precisely controlled thicknesses. As film thickness decreased, the magnetization dramatically deteriorated, and the electronic state changed from metallic to insulating. Strikingly, the high&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was maintained in a Fe3N layer with a thickness down to 2 u. c. (&#8764;8 &#197;). The magnetoresistance exhibited a strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy; meanwhile, the anomalous Hall resistance reserved its sign when Fe3N layer thickness exceeded 5 u. c. Furthermore, we observed a sizable exchange bias at the interfaces between a ferromagnetic Fe3N and an antiferromagnetic CrN. The exchange bias field and saturation moment strongly depended on the controllable bending curvature using the cylinder diameter engineering technique, implying the tunable magnetic states under lattice deformation. This work provides a guideline for exploring functional nitride films and applying their interfacial phenomena for innovative perspectives toward practical applications.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) are produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of economic and environmental benefits, direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by the direct recycling method is generally not ideal due to the migration of iron (Fe) ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish lithium ion (Li+) diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. Here, we effectively regenerated spent LFP by using environment&#8208;friendly ethanol and promoted its cycling stability by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via constructing a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#8208;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The diffusion kinetics of Li+ in regenerated LFP were improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, the cell with a regenerated LFP cathode exhibits an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance at a high rate of 10 C with &#8764;80% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Fluorination enhances NIR&#8208;II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency of phototheranostic agents for imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Phototheranostics with second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging and photothermal effect have become a burgeoning biotechnology for tumor diagnosis and precise treatment. As important parameters of phototheranostic agents (PTAs), fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) are usually considered as a pair of contradictions that is difficult to be simultaneously enhanced. Herein, a fluorination strategy for designing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type PTAs with synchronously improved QY and PCE is proposed. Experiment results show that the molar extinction coefficient (&#949;), NIR&#8208;II QY and PCE of all fluorinated PTAs nanoparticles (NPs) are definitely improved compared with the chlorinated counterparts. Theoretical calculation results demonstrate that fluorination can maximize the electrostatic potential difference by virtue of high electronegativity of fluorine, which may increase intra/intermolecular D&#8208;A interactions, tighten molecule packing and further promote the increase of &#949;, ultimately leading to simultaneously enhanced QY and PCE. In these PTA NPs, FY6&#8208;NPs display NIR&#8208;II emission extended to 1400&#160;nm with the highest NIR&#8208;II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%). These features make FY6&#8208;NPs perform well in high&#8208;resolution imaging of vasculature and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor. This study develops a valuable guideline for constructing NIR&#8208;II organic PTAs with high performances.

In these PTA NPs, FY6-NPs display NIR-II emission extended to 1400&#160;nm with the highest NIR-II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%). These features make FY6-NPs perform well in high-resolution imaging of vasculature and NIR-II imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor. This study develops a valuable guideline for constructing NIR-II organic PTAs with high performances.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phosphorous Dendron Micelles as a Nanomedicine Platform for Cooperative Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Immune Cells</title>

Abstract
Design of effective nanomedicines to modulate multiple immune cells to overcome the immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment is desirable to improve the overall poor clinical outcomes of immunotherapy. Herein, we report a nanomedicine platform based on chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded phosphorus dendron micelles (M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX, TBP, tyramine bearing two dimethylphosphonate) with inherent immunomodulatory activity for synergistic tumor chemoimmunotherapy. The M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX micelles with good stability and a mean particle size of 86.4 nm can deliver DOX to solid tumors to induce significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). With the demonstrated intrinsic activity of M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa that can promote the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, the ICD&#8208;resulted maturation of dendritic cells of the DOX&#8208;loaded micelles, and the combination of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody, we demonstrate the synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation, recruitment of tumor&#8208;infiltrating NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, and decrease of regulatory T cells for effective tumor chemoimmunotherapy with strong antitumor immunity and immune memory effect for effective prevention of lung metastasis. The developed phosphorous dendron micelles may hold great promise to be used as an advanced nanomedicine formulation for synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation for effective chemoimmunotherapy of different tumor types.

         <title>Large Magneto&#8208;transverse and Longitudinal Thermoelectric Effects in the Magnetic Weyl Semimetal TbPtBi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic topological semimetals provide new opportunities for power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling based on thermoelectric (TE) effect. The interplay between magnetism and nontrivial bands topology prompts the magnetic topological semimetals to yield strong transverse thermoelectric effect, while the longitudinal TE performance is usually poor. Herein, we demonstrate that the magnetic Weyl semimetal TbPtBi has high value for both transverse and longitudinal thermopower with large power factor (PF). At 300 K and 13.5 Tesla, the transverse thermopower and PF reach up to 214 &#956;V K&#8722;1 and 35 &#956;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, respectively, which are comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TE materials. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations, longitudinal magnetoresistance and planar Hall resistance measurements, and two&#8208;band model fitting, we attribute the large transverse thermopower and PF to both bipolar effect and large Hall angle. Moreover, the imperfectly compensated charge carriers and large transverse magnetoresistance induce the maximum magneto&#8208;longitudinal thermopower of 251 &#956;V K&#8722;1 with a PF of 24 &#956;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 150 K and 13.5 Tesla, which is two times higher than that at zero magnetic field. This work demonstrates the great potential of topological semimetals for TEs and offers a new excellent candidate for magneto&#8208;TEs.

Abstract
The detection and monitoring of ultra&#8208;low humidity (&lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high&#8208;tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm&#8208;level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular&#8208;level humidity&#8208;sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as&#8208;prepared ultra&#8208;low humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked&#8208;eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy, and low&#8208;cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultra&#8208;low humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy could bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.

         <title>Emergent, Non&#8208;Aging, Extendable, and Rechargeable Exchange Bias in Two&#8208;Dimensional Fe3GeTe2 Homostructures Induced by Moderate Pressuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a crucial concept in magnetism and spintronics, exchange bias (ExB) measures the asymmetry in the hysteresis loop of a pinned ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet (AFM) interface. Previous studies were mainly focused on FM/AFM heterostructures composed of conventional bulk materials whose complex interfaces prohibit precise control and full understanding of the phenomenon. Here we exploit the enabling power of two&#8208;dimensional magnets to demonstrate the emergence, non&#8208;aging, extendability, and rechargeability of ExB in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 homostructures upon moderate pressuring. The emergence of the ExB is attributed to a local stress&#8208;induced FM&#8208;to&#8208;AFM transition, as validated using first&#8208;principles calculations and confirmed in magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect and second harmonic generation measurements. We also observe negligible ExB aging before the training effect suddenly takes place through avalanching, pronounced delay of the avalanche via timed pressure repetition (extendability), ExB recovery in the post&#8208;training sample upon refreshed pressuring (rechargeability), and demonstrate its versatile tunability. These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.

         <title>Janus Au&#8208;Polymersome Heterostructure with Near&#8208;Field Enhancement Effect for Implant&#8208;Associated Infection Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid Janus nanoparticles (PI&#8208;JNPs) have attracted extensive attention due to their special structures and functions. However, achieving the synergistic enhancement of photochemical activity between polymer and inorganic moieties in PI&#8208;JNPs remains challenging. Herein, we report the construction of a novel Janus Au&#8208;porphyrin polymersome (J&#8208;AuPPS) heterostructure by a facile one&#8208;step photocatalytic synthesis. The near&#8208;field enhancement (NFE) effect between porphyrin polymersome (PPS) and Au nanoparticles in J&#8208;AuPPS is achieved to enhance its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption and electric/thermal field intensity at their interface, which improve the energy transfer and energetic charge carrier generation. Therefore, J&#8208;AuPPS shows a higher NIR&#8208;activated photothermal conversion efficiency (48.4%) and generates more singlet oxygen compared with non&#8208;Janus core&#8208;particle Au&#8208;PPS nanostructure (28.4%). As a result, J&#8208;AuPPS exhibits excellent dual&#8208;mode (photothermal/photodynamic) antibacterial and antibiofilm performance and thereby significantly enhances in vivo therapeutic effect on the implant&#8208;associated infection rat model. We believe this work will motivate the rational design of advanced hybrid Janus nanoparticles with the desirable NFE effect and further extend their biological applications.

         <title>Interface Capture Effect Printing Atomic&#8208;Thick 2D Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to print arrays of atomic&#8208;thick semiconducting thin films is demonstrated, which enables printed devices with micrometer&#8208;scale resolution, high density, and attractive performance, thus paving the way for practical large&#8208;area application of 2D crystals in electronic devices at an affordable cost.








Abstract
2D semiconductor crystals offer the opportunity to further extend Moore's law to the atomic scale. For practical and low&#8208;cost electronic applications, directly printing devices on substrates is advantageous compared to conventional microfabrication techniques that utilize expensive photolithography, etching, and vacuum&#8208;metallization processes. However, the currently printed 2D transistors are plagued by unsatisfactory electrical performance, thick semiconductor layers, and low device density. Herein, a facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy is demonstrated utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to fabricate high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;thick semiconductor thin&#8208;film arrays without additional surfactants. Printed robust thin&#8208;film transistors using 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) and 2D conductive electrodes (e.g., graphene) exhibit high electrical performance, including a carrier mobility of up to 6.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106 at 25&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, 2D transistors are printed with a density of &#8776;47&#160;000 devices per square centimeter. In addition, this method can be applied to many other 2D materials, such as NbSe2, Bi2Se3, and black phosphorus, for printing diverse high&#8208;quality thin films. Thus, the strategy of printable 2D thin&#8208;film transistors provides a scalable pathway for the facile manufacturing of high&#8208;performance electronics at an affordable cost.

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide/Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene oxide/porous graphene/graphene oxide (GO/PG/GO) membrane separation technology by pressure&#8208;driven filtration is reported and it is applied in isotope separation at room temperature. It shows&#160;an excellent structural, long&#8208;term stability, ultralow energy consumption, and ultrahigh selectivity for deuterium water, including rejection rate of &#8776;97%, the selectivity of &#8776;35.2 as well.








Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is a strategic material that is widely used in and scientific research and has applications in fields such as nuclear energy generation. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room&#8208;temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores are sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25&#160;&#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O is &#8776;97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O is &#8776;35.2, and the excellent performance can be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water is successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage, and the membrane exhibits excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method does not require ultralow temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes Achieved by Bifunctional, Sustainable Separators with Tailored Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel, mechanically flexible and bifunctional separator integrates the merits of serving as a highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributor to self&#8208;regulate/orientate the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecular level and physically suppresses Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structural level. Remarkably, Na symmetric cells achieve unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities in additive&#8208;free carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large&#8208;scale practical implementation of Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly used and low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising well&#8208;ordered, uniaxially aligned arrays, and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributors to self&#8208;orientate/homogenize the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities (&#8805;1000&#160;h at 1 and 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#8805;700&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive&#8208;free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium&#8211;organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low&#8208;cost, and safe&#8208;credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Making Highly Elastic and Tough Hydrogels from Doughs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of using preexisting polymer chains to fabricate hydrogels from doughs is reported. The dough is formed by mixing the polymers with water and photoinitiator. Kneading and annealing then homogenize the dough and entangle the polymers. The polymers are crosslinked and swollen in water to equilibrium. Such a hydrogel resolves the conflict between swell&#8208;resistance and toughness, while having near&#8208;perfect elasticity.








Abstract
A hydrogel is often fabricated from preexisting polymer chains by covalently crosslinking them into a polymer network. The crosslinks make the hydrogel swell&#8208;resistant but brittle. This conflict is resolved here by making a hydrogel from a dough. The dough is formed by mixing long polymer chains with a small amount of water and photoinitiator. The dough is then homogenized by kneading and annealing at elevated temperatures, during which the crowded polymer chains densely entangle. The polymer chains are then sparsely crosslinked into a polymer network under an ultraviolet lamp, and submerged in water to swell to equilibrium. The resulting hydrogel is both swell&#8208;resistant and tough. The hydrogel also has near&#8208;perfect elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low friction. The method is demonstrated with two widely used polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose. These hydrogels have never been made swell&#8208;resistant, elastic, and tough before. The method is generally applicable to synthetic and natural polymers, and is compatible with industrial processing technologies, opening doors to the development of sustainable, high&#8208;performance hydrogels.

         <title>Information&#8208;Storage Expansion Enabled by a Resilient Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission&#8208;Active Nanocomposite Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite&#160;hydrogel is developed. The AIE luminogen can multiply protonate to interact with the clay through the electrostatic interaction in the gel network under acid stimulation, which causes fluorescence enhancement and a blueshift of the hydrogel. Synergistically taking advantage of this behavior and the high resilience of the hydrogel, information&#8208;storage expansion, and dual&#8208;encryption are realized.








Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel (Laponite is a trademark of the company BYK Additives Ltd.). The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. Moreover, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information&#8208;storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

&lt;p&gt;An aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active nanocomposite&#160;hydrogel is developed. The AIE luminogen can multiply protonate to interact with the clay through the electrostatic interaction in the gel network under acid stimulation, which causes fluorescence enhancement and a blueshift of the hydrogel. Synergistically taking advantage of this behavior and the high resilience of the hydrogel, information-storage expansion, and dual-encryption are realized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH-responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide-based NC hydrogel (Laponite is a trademark of the company BYK Additives Ltd.). The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. Moreover, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information-storage expansion and dual-encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unity of Opposites between Soluble and Insoluble Lithium Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;S battery performance is a compromise of opposites between the stability and capacity performance of the battery, in which the state of lithium polysulfides in electrolytes plays a pivotal role. The delicately dialectical relationship between soluble and insoluble lithium polysulfides in Li&#8211;S batteries is reviewed and discussed, and perspectives on the future research development of Li&#8211;S batteries are provided.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on Li&#8211;S chemistry show promise as being possible for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices because of their ultrahigh capacities and energy densities. Research over the past decade has demonstrated that the morphology of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) in electrolytes (soluble or insoluble) plays a decisive role in battery performance. Early studies have focused mainly on inhibiting the dissolution of LPSs and invested considerable effort to realize this objective. However, in recent years, a completely different view that the dissolution of LPSs during battery discharge/charge should be promoted has emerged. At this critical juncture in the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;S batteries, it is time to summarize and discuss both sides of the contradiction. Herein, an overview of these two opposite views pertaining to soluble and insoluble LPSs, including their historical environment, classical strategies, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, the future morphology of LPSs in Li&#8211;S batteries is predicted based on a multiangle review of research studies conducted thus far, and the reasoning behind this conjecture is thoroughly discussed.

         <title>Scalable Ultrathin All&#8208;Organic Polymer Dielectric Films for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cost&#8208;effective ultrasonic spray&#8208;coating is utilized for large&#8208;scale ultrathin dielectric films and large&#8208;size multilayer polymer foil film capacitors for high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage. All&#8208;organic ultrathin composite films of polyimides with &#63743;CF3 dipolar groups as&#160;the matrix (F&#8208;PI) and trace organic semiconductor as charge traps deliver an excellent discharge energy density with 90% discharge efficiency U&#951;90&#160;&#8776; 4.39 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C.








Abstract
The miniaturization of electronic devices and power systems for capacitive energy storage under harsh environments requires scalable high&#8208;quality ultrathin high&#8208;temperature dielectric films. To meet the need, ultrasonic spray&#8208;coating (USC) can be used. Novel polyimides with a dipolar group, &#63743;CF3 (F&#8208;PI), and all&#8208;organic composites with trace organic semiconductor can serve as models. These scalable high&#8208;quality ultrathin films (&#8776;2.6 and &#8776;5.2&#160;&#181;m) are successfully fabricated via USC. The high quality of the films is evaluated from the micro&#8208;millimeter scale to the sub&#8208;millimeter and above. The high glass transition temperature Tg (&#8776;340 &#176;C) and concurrent large bandgap Eg (&#8776;3.53&#160;eV) induced by weak conjugation from considerable interchain distance (&#8776;6.2 &#197;) enable F&#8208;PI to be an excellent matrix delivering a discharge energy density with 90% discharge efficiency U&#951;90 of 2.85 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C. Further, the incorporation of a trace organic semiconductor leads to a record U&#951;90 of &#8776;4.39 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C due to the markedly enhanced breakdown strength caused by deep charge traps of &#8776;2&#160;eV. Also, a USC&#8208;fabricated multilayer F&#8208;PI foil capacitor with &#8776;85&#160;nF (six layers) has good performance at 150 &#176;C. These results confirm that USC is an excellent technology to fabricate high&#8208;quality ultrathin dielectric films and capacitors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface&#8208;Reinforced Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Performance and Mechanical Reliability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two key interfaces on either side of the metal&#8208;halide perovskite thin film in flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are reinforced simultaneously. This new class of dual&#8208;interface&#8208;reinforced f&#8208;PSCs has an unprecedented combination of high efficiency (21.03%), improved operational stability (1000 h T90), and enhanced mechanical reliability (10 000 cycles n88). The scientific underpinnings of these synergistic enhancements are elucidated.








Abstract
Two key interfaces in flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are mechanically reinforced simultaneously: one between the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and the 3D metal&#8208;halide perovskite (MHP) thin film using self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), and the other between the 3D&#8208;MHP thin film and the hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) using an in situ grown low&#8208;dimensional (LD) MHP capping layer. The interfacial mechanical properties are measured and modeled. This rational interface engineering results in the enhancement of not only the mechanical properties of both interfaces but also their optoelectronic properties holistically. As a result, the new class of dual&#8208;interface&#8208;reinforced f&#8208;PSCs has an unprecedented combination of the following three important performance parameters: high power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.03% (with reduced hysteresis), improved operational stability of 1000&#160;h T90 (duration at 90% initial PCE retained), and enhanced mechanical reliability of 10 000 cycles n88 (number of bending cycles at 88% initial PCE retained). The scientific underpinnings of these synergistic enhancements are elucidated.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Jet Fusion 3D Voxel Printing of Conductive Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Voxelated parts with site&#8208;specific electrical properties are built using a newly developed multifunctional agent. The conductive components in the agent are programmed to be dispensed in the designated regions of the polymer matrix during printing, enabling exquisite control over the electrical conductivity (in a range of nine orders of magnitude) of the printed parts at a voxel resolution of &#8776;100 &#181;m.








Abstract
3D voxel printing enables the fabrication of parts with site&#8208;specific materials and properties at voxel&#8208;scale resolution, while the current research mainly focuses on the variations in mechanical properties and colors. In this work,&#160;the design and fabrication of voxelated conductive elastomers using Multi Jet Fusion 3D voxel printing actualized by a newly developed multifunctional agent (MA) are investigated. The MA, mainly consisting of carbon nanotubes and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, serves&#160;as an infrared&#8208;absorbing colorant, a reinforcement, and a conductive filler simultaneously. By controlling the drop&#8208;on&#8208;demand dispensing of the agents on thermoplastic polyurethane powder, the electrical conductivity across a single printed part can be tailored over a wide range from 10&#8722;10 to 10&#8722;1 S cm&#8722;1 at a voxel resolution of &#8776;100&#160;&#181;m. Assembly&#8208;free strain sensors comprising conductive sensing layers and insulating frames are fabricated to demonstrate the capability of the technique in manufacturing all&#8208;printed wearable devices.

         <title>Freestanding and Scalable Force&#8208;Softness Bimodal Sensor Arrays for Haptic Body&#8208;Feature Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding and scalable tactile platforms with force&#8208;softness bimodal sensor arrays are developed, enabling a tactile glove to digitalize pressing force and softness in large areas of the human body. Combining with machine&#8208;learning methods, the tactile glove identifies body features in a real person and a medical abdominal simulator with high accuracy (98%).








Abstract
Tactile technologies that can identify human body features are valuable in clinical diagnosis and human&#8211;machine interactions. Previously, cutting&#8208;edge tactile platforms have been able to&#160;identify structured non&#8208;living objects; however, identification of human body features remains challenging mainly because of the irregular contour and heterogeneous spatial distribution of softness. Here, freestanding and scalable tactile platforms of force&#8208;softness bimodal sensor arrays are developed, enabling tactile gloves to identify body features using machine&#8208;learning methods. The bimodal sensors are engineered by adding a protrusion on a piezoresistive pressure sensor, endowing the resistance signals with combined information of pressure and the softness of samples. The simple design enables 112 bimodal sensors to be integrated into a thin, conformal, and stretchable tactile glove, allowing the tactile information to be digitalized while hand skills are performed on the human body. The tactile glove shows high accuracy (98%) in identifying four body features of a real person, and four organ models (healthy and pathological) inside an abdominal simulator, demonstrating identification of body features of the bimodal tactile platforms and showing their potential use in future healthcare and robotics.

         <title>Quantification of the Electromechanical Measurements by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coexistence of the regions with positive and negative piezoelectricity within the 20 nm&#8208;thick La:HfO2 capacitor is revealed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) local spectroscopy and imaging. A PFM loop obtained in region L1 exhibits a negative piezoelectric coefficient, while a mirror&#8208;reflected PFM loop is obtained from region L2 with positive piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is widely used for characterization and exploration of the nanoscale properties of ferroelectrics. However, quantification of the PFM signal is challenging due to the convolution of various extrinsic and intrinsic contributions. Although quantification of the PFM amplitude signal has received considerable attention, quantification of the PFM phase signal has not been addressed. A properly calibrated PFM phase signal can provide valuable information on the sign of the local piezoelectric coefficient&#8212;an important and nontrivial issue for emerging ferroelectrics. In this work, two complementary methodologies to calibrate the PFM phase signal are discussed. The first approach is based on using a standard reference sample with well&#8208;known independently measured piezoelectric coefficients, while the second approach exploits&#160;the electrostatic sample&#8211;cantilever interactions to determine the parasitic phase offset. Application of these methodologies to studies of the piezoelectric behavior in ferroelectric HfO2&#8208;based thin&#8208;film capacitors reveals intriguing variations in the sign of the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, d33,eff. It is shown that the piezoelectric properties of the HfO2&#8208;based capacitors are inherently sensitive to their thickness, electrodes, as well as deposition methods, and can exhibit wide variations including a d33,eff sign change within a single device.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Transport Layers Employing Strongly Bound Ligands Enhance Stability in Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photodetectors operating at 1450 nm, based on CQD electron&#8208;transport layers (ETLs) are demonstrated, and they achieve superior performance to previous works that rely on metal oxide ETLs. A strategy employing strongly bound organic carboxylate ligands to suppress ion migration inside the ETL and enable the stable operation of CQD photodetectors is developed.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed photodetectors based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wavelength infrared light sensing applications. Present&#8208;day CQD photodetectors employ a CQD active layer sandwiched between carrier&#8208;transport layers in which the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) is composed of metal oxides. Herein, a new class of ETLs is developed using n&#8208;type CQDs, finding that these benefit from quantum&#8208;size effect tuning of the band energies, as well as from surface ligand engineering. Photodetectors operating at 1450 nm are demonstrated using CQDs with tailored functionalities for each of the transport layers and the active layer. By optimizing the band alignment between the ETL and the active layer, CQD photodetectors that combine a low dark current of &#8776;1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 mA cm&#8722;2 with a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;66% at 1&#160;V are reported, outperforming prior reports of CQD photodetectors operating at &gt;1400 nm that rely on metal oxides as ETLs. It is shown that stable CQD photodetectors rely on well&#8208;passivated CQDs: for ETL CQDs, a strongly bound organic ligand trans&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid (TFCA) provides improved passivation compared to the weakly bound inorganic ligand tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI). TFCA suppresses bias&#8208;induced ion migration inside the ETL and improves the operating stability of photodetectors by 50&#215; compared to TBAI.
