         <title>Strengthening The Hetero&#8208;Molecular Interactions in Giant Dimeric Acceptors Enables Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Giant dimeric acceptor (G&#8208;Dimer) is becoming one of the most promising organic solar cell (OSC) materials because of its definite structure, long&#8208;term stability, and high efficiency. Strengthening the hetero&#8208;molecular interactions by monomer modification greatly influences the morphology and thus the device performance and stability, but lacks investigation. Herein, two novel quinoxaline core&#8208;based G&#8208;Dimers, Dimer&#8208;QX and Dimer&#8208;2CF, were synthesized. By comparing trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted Dimer&#8208;2CF and non&#8208;substituted Dimer&#8208;QX, the trifluoromethylation effect on the G&#8208;Dimer was investigated and revealed. The trifluoromethyl with strong electronegativity increased electrostatic potential and reduced surface energy of the G&#8208;Dimer, weakening the homo&#8208;molecular ordered packing but reinforcing the hetero&#8208;molecular interaction with the donor. The strong hetero&#8208;molecular interaction suppressed the fast assembly during the film formation, facilitating small domains with ordered molecular packing in the blend, which is a trade&#8208;off in conventional morphology control. Together with favourable vertical phase separation, efficient charge generation, and reduced bimolecular recombination were concurrently obtained. Hence, the Dimer&#8208;2CF&#8208;based OSCs obtained a cutting&#8208;edge efficiency of 19.02% with FF surpassing 80%, and an averaged extrapolated T80 of ca. 12000&#160;hrs under continuous 80&#160;&#176;C heating. This study emphasized the importance of hetero&#8208;molecular interaction and trifluoromethylation strategy, providing a facile strategy for designing highly efficient and stable OSC materials.

&lt;p&gt;Giant dimeric acceptor (G-Dimer) is becoming one of the most promising organic solar cell (OSC) materials because of its definite structure, long-term stability, and high efficiency. Strengthening the hetero-molecular interactions by monomer modification greatly influences the morphology and thus the device performance and stability, but lacks investigation. Herein, two novel quinoxaline core-based G-Dimers, Dimer-QX and Dimer-2CF, were synthesized. By comparing trifluoromethyl-substituted Dimer-2CF and non-substituted Dimer-QX, the trifluoromethylation effect on the G-Dimer was investigated and revealed.

         <title>Construct Robust Epitaxial Growth of (101) Textured Zinc Metal Anode for Long Life and High Capacity in Mild Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries are considered to have the potential for energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, the practical applications of zinc batteries are limited by dendrite growth and side reactions. Epitaxial growth is considered an effective method for stabilizing Zn anode, especially for manipulating the (002) plane of deposited zinc. However, (002) texture zinc is difficult to achieve stable cycle at high capacity due to its large lattice distortion and uneven electric field distribution. Here, we construct a novel zinc anode with highly (101) texture (denoted as (101)&#8208;Zn). Due to unique directional guidance and strong bonding effect, (101)&#8208;Zn can achieve dense vertical electroepitaxy in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. In addition, the low grain boundary area inhibits the occurrence of side reactions. The resultant (101)&#8208;Zn symmetric cells exhibit excellent stability over 5300 h (4 mA cm&#8722;2 for 2 mAh cm&#8722;2) and 330 h (15 mA cm&#8722;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the cycle life of Zn//MnO2 full cell is meaningfully improved over 1000 cycles.

         <title>Halogenated Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptor for Organic Solar Cells with a Record Efficiency of Over 17%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three nonfused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), namely 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;F, 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;Cl, and 3TT&#8208;C2, have been purposefully designed and synthesized with the concept of halogenation. The incorporation of F or/and Cl atoms into the molecular structure (3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;F and 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;Cl) enhances the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, improves electron mobility, and regulates the nanofiber morphology of blend films, thus facilitating the exciton dissociation and charge transport. In particular, blend films based on D18:3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;F demonstrate a high charge mobility, an extended exciton diffusion distance, and a well&#8208;formed nanofiber network. These factors contribute to devices with a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.19%, surpassing that of 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;Cl (16.17%) and 3TT&#8208;C2 (15.42%). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest efficiency achieved in NFREA&#8208;based devices up to now. These results highlight the potential of halogenation in NFREAs as a promising approach to enhance the performance of organic solar cells.

         <title>Employing Noble Metal&#8208;Porphyrins to Engineer Robust and Highly Active Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes for Targeted Catalytic Therapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes) have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional enzymes. However, the chemical instability limits their application. Here, we present a systematic synthesis of highly active and stable SANzymes by leveraging noble metal&#8208;porphyrins. Four noble metal&#8208;porphyrins are successfully synthesized to mimic the active site of natural peroxidases through atomic metal&#8208;N coordination anchored to the porphyrin center. These noble metal&#8208;porphyrins are integrated into a stable and biocompatible Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MxP, x denoting Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd). Among these, MIrP demonstrates superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity (685.61 U mg&#8722;1), catalytic efficiency, and selectivity compared to horseradish peroxidase (267.71 U mg&#8722;1). Mechanistic investigations unveil that the heightened catalytic activity of MIrP arises from its robust H2O2 adsorption capacity, the unique rate&#8208;determining step, and low energy threshold. Crucially, MIrP exhibits remarkable chemical stability under both room temperature and high H2O2 concentrations. Furthermore, through modification with (&#8722;)&#8208;Epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;Gallate, a natural ligand for Epstein&#8208;Barr virus (EBV)&#8208;encoded latent membrane protein 1, we engineer a targeted SANzyme (MIrPHE) tailored for EBV&#8208;associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This study not only presents an innovative strategy for augmenting the catalytic activity and chemical stability of SANzymes, but also highlights the substantial potential of MIrP as a potent nanomedicine for targeted catalytic tumor therapy.

         <title>Advancements of Intense Terahertz Field Focusing on Metallic Nanoarchitectures for Monitoring Hidden Interatomic Gas&#8208;Matter Interactions</title>

Abstract
With the advancements of nanotechnology, innovative photonic designs coupled with the functional materials provide a unique way to acquire, share, and respond effectively to information. We found that the simple deposition of a 30&#160;nm&#8208;thick palladium nanofilm on a terahertz metasurface chip with a 14&#160;nm&#8208;wide effective nanogap of asymmetric materials and geometries allows the tracking of both interatomic and interfacial gas&#8211;matter interactions, including gas adsorption, hydrogenation (or dehydrogenation), metal phase changes, and unique water&#8208;forming reactions. Combinatorial analyses by simulation and experimental measurements demonstrated our distinct nanostructures, which led to significant light&#8208;matter interactions and corresponding terahertz absorption in a real&#8208;time, highly repeatable, and reliable manner. The complex lattice dynamics and intrinsic properties of metals influenced by hydrogen gas exposure were also thoroughly examined using systematically controlled ternary gas mixture devices that mimic normal temperature and pressure. Furthermore, we utilized the novel degrees of freedom to analyze various physical phenomena, and thus, introduced analytical methods that enabled the tracking of unknown hidden stages of water&#8208;forming reactions resulting in water growth. A single exposure of the wave spectrum emphasizes the robustness of the proposed terahertz nanoscopic probe, bridging the gap between fundamental laboratory research and industry.

         <title>Insulin&#8211;Dendrimer Nanocomplex for Multi&#8208;Day Glucose&#8208;Responsive Therapy in Mice and Swine</title>

Abstract
The management of diabetes in a manner offering autonomous insulin therapy responsive to glucose&#8208;directed need, and moreover with a dosing schedule amenable to facile administration, remains an ongoing goal to improve the standard of care. While basal insulins with reduced dosing frequency, even once&#8208;weekly administration, are on the horizon, there is still no approved therapy that offers glucose&#8208;responsive insulin function. Herein, a nanoscale complex combining both electrostatic and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions between a synthetic dendrimer carrier and an insulin analogue modified with a high&#8208;affinity glucose&#8208;binding motif yields an injectable insulin depot affording both glucose&#8208;directed and long&#8208;lasting insulin availability. Following a single injection, it is even possible to control blood glucose for at least one week in diabetic swine subjected to oral glucose challenges. Measurements of serum insulin concentration in response to challenge show increases in insulin corresponding to elevated blood glucose levels, an uncommon finding even in preclinical work on glucose&#8208;responsive insulin. Accordingly, the subcutaneous nanocomplex that results from combining electrostatic and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions between a modified insulin and a synthetic dendrimer carrier affords a glucose&#8208;responsive insulin depot for week&#8208;long control following a single routine injection.

         <title>Understanding the Electrical Mechanisms in Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries: From Electrostatic Interactions to Electric Field Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced approaches to prohibit dendrite growth, suppress side reactions, and promote reaction kinetics of Zn metal anodes are essential for practical Zn metal batteries. In this review, the effects of electrical&#8208;related electrostatic interaction and electrical field regulation on the Zn2+ ions migration and deposition behavior in aqueous Zn metal batteries, with an emphasis on the challenges and prospects, are summarized.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are considered as competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their excellent safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the inevitable dendrite growth, severe hydrogen evolution, surface passivation, and sluggish reaction kinetics of Zn metal anodes hinder the practical application of Zn metal batteries. Detailed summaries and prospects have been reported focusing on the research progress and challenges of Zn metal anodes, including electrolyte engineering, electrode structure design, and surface modification. However, the essential electrical mechanisms that significantly influence Zn2+ ions migration and deposition behaviors have not been reviewed yet. Herein, in this review, the regulation mechanisms of electrical&#8208;related electrostatic repulsive/attractive interactions on Zn2+ ions migration, desolvation, and deposition behaviors are systematically discussed. Meanwhile, electric field regulation strategies to promote the Zn2+ ions diffusion and uniform Zn deposition are comprehensively reviewed, including enhancing and homogenizing electric field intensity inside the batteries and adding external magnetic/pressure/thermal field to couple with the electric field. Finally, future perspectives on the research directions of the electrical&#8208;related strategies for building better Zn metal batteries in practical applications are offered.

         <title>Correlating Single&#8208;Atomic Ruthenium Interdistance with Long&#8208;Range Interaction Boosts Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs) with different and precise single&#8208;atomic interdistances are constructed via a combination of planar organometallic molecular design and &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecule&#8211;carbon nanotube confinement, for systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the atomic level, precisely manipulating the electrostatic force using the atomic structure and leading to severalfold enhancement in the activity of c&#8208;SACs with multimetal sites.








Abstract
Correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs) with tailored intersite metal&#8211;metal interactions are superior to conventional catalysts with isolated metal sites. However, precise quantification of the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in c&#8208;SACs is not yet achieved, which is essential for a crucial understanding and remarkable improvement of the correlated metal&#8208;site&#8208;governed catalytic reaction kinetics. Here, three Ru c&#8208;SACs are fabricated with precise SAD using a planar organometallic molecular design and &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecule&#8211;carbon nanotube confinement. This strategy results in graded SAD from 2.4 to 9.3 &#197; in the Ru c&#8208;SACs, wherein tailoring the Ru SAD into 7.0 &#197; generates an exceptionally high turnover frequency of 17.92 H2 s&#8722;1 and a remarkable mass activity of 100.4 A mg&#8722;1 under 50 and 100 mV overpotentials, respectively, which is superior to all the Ru&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations confirm that Ru SAD has a negative correlation with its d&#8208;band center owing to the long&#8208;range interactions induced by distinct local atomic geometries, resulting in an appropriate electrostatic potential and the highest catalytic activity on c&#8208;SACs with 7.0 &#197; Ru SAD. The present study promises an attractive methodology for experimentally quantifying the metal SAD to provide valuable insights into the catalytic mechanism of c&#8208;SACs.

         <title>Manganese@Albumin Nanocomplex and Its Assembled Nanowire Activate TLR4&#8208;Dependent Signaling Cascades of Macrophages</title>

Abstract
The immunomodulatory effect of divalent manganese cations (Mn2+), such as activation of the cGAS&#8722;STING pathway or NLRP3 inflammasomes, positions them as adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we found that trace Mn2+ ions, bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form Mn@BSA nanocomplexes, stimulated pro&#8208;inflammatory responses in human&#8208; or murine&#8208;derived macrophages through TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling cascades. Building on this, the assembly of Mn@BSA nanocomplexes to obtain nanowire structures enables stronger and longer&#8208;lasting immunostimulation of macrophages by regulating phagocytosis. Furthermore, Mn@BSA nanocomplexes and their nanowires efficiently activated peritoneal macrophages, reprogrammed tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, and inhibited the growth of melanoma tumors in vivo. They also show better biosafety for potential clinical applications compared to typical TLR4 agonists like lipopolysaccharides. Accordingly, our findings provide insights into the mechanism of metalloalbumin complexes as potential TLR agonists that activate macrophage polarization, and highlight the importance of their nanostructures in regulating macrophage&#8208;mediated innate immunity.

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport for Ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycling Dendrite&#8208;free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries can address crucial challenges regarding insufficient battery cycling life and energy density. The demonstration of long&#8208;cycling dendrite&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries requires precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). In this work, we report a proof of concept for precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport of a halide SSE, Li3InCl6, including intragranular (within grains) but also intergranular (between grains) lithium&#8208;ion transport. Lithium&#8208;ion migration tailoring mechanism in crystals is developed by unexpected enhanced Li, In, and Cl vacancy populations and lower energy barrier for hopping. The lithium&#8208;ion transport tailoring mechanism between the grains is determined by the elimination of voids between grains and the formation of unexpected supersonic conducting grain boundaries, boosting the lithium dendrite suppression ability of SSE. Due to boosted lithium&#8208;ion conduction and dendrite&#8208;suppression ability, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries coupled with Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes and lithium metal anodes demonstrated breakthroughs in electrochemical performance by achieving extremely long cycling life at a high current density of 0.5 C (2000 cycles, 93.7% capacity retention). This concept of precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport provides a cost, time, and energy efficient solution to conquer the remaining challenges in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries for fast developing electric vehicle markets.

         <title>Microphase&#8208;Separated Elastic and Ultrastretchable Ionogel for Reliable Ionic Skin with Multimodal Sensation</title>

Abstract
Bioinspired artificial skins integrated with reliable human&#8208;machine interfaces and stretchable electronic systems have attracted considerable attention. However, the current design faces difficulties in simultaneously achieving satisfactory skin&#8208;like mechanical compliance and self&#8208;powered multimodal sensing. Here, we report a microphase&#8208;separated bicontinuous ionogel which possesses skin&#8208;like mechanical properties and mimics the multimodal sensing ability of biological skin by ion&#8208;driven stimuli&#8208;electricity conversion. The ionogel exhibits excellent elasticity and ionic conductivity, high toughness and ultrastretchability, as well as a Young's modulus similar to that of human skin. Leveraging the ion&#8208;polymer interactions enabled selective ion transport, the ionogel can output pulsing or continuous electrical signals in response to diverse stimuli such as strain, touch pressure, and temperature sensitively, demonstrating a unique self&#8208;powered multimodal sensing. Furthermore, the ionogel&#8208;based I&#8208;skin can concurrently sense different stimuli and decouple the variations of the stimuli from the voltage signals with the assistance of a machine&#8208;learning model. The ease of fabrication, wide tunability, self&#8208;powered multimodal sensing, and the excellent environmental tolerance of the ionogels demonstrate a new strategy in the development of next&#8208;generation soft smart mechano&#8208;transduction devices.

         <title>Enzymatically Activatable Polymers for Disease Diagnosis and Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The irregular expression or activity of enzymes in the human body leads to various pathological disorders and can therefore be used as an intrinsic trigger for more precise identification of disease foci and controlled release of diagnostics and therapeutics, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and therapeutic efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. Advanced synthesis strategies enable the preparation of polymers with enzymatically activatable skeletons or side chains, while understanding enzymatically responsive mechanisms promotes rational incorporation of activatable units and predictions of the release profile of diagnostics and therapeutics, ultimately leading to promising applications in disease diagnosis and treatment with superior biocompatibility and efficiency. By overcoming the challenges, new opportunities will emerge to inspire researchers to develop more efficient, safer, and clinically reliable enzymatically activatable polymeric carriers as well as prodrugs.

         <title>Hexagonal Boron Nitride Slab Waveguides for Enhanced Spectroscopy of Encapsulated 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The layered insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a critical substrate that brings out the exceptional intrinsic properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, we demonstrate how hBN slabs tuned to the correct thickness act as optical waveguides, enabling direct optical coupling of light emission from encapsulated layers into waveguide modes. We integrate two types of TMD monolayers (MoSe2 and WSe2) within hBN&#8208;based waveguides and demonstrate direct coupling of photoluminescence emitted by in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane transition dipoles (bright and dark excitons) to slab waveguide modes. Fourier plane imaging of waveguided photoluminescence from MoSe2 demonstrates that dry etched hBN edges are an effective out&#8208;coupler of waveguided light without the need for oil&#8208;immersion optics. Gated photoluminescence of WSe2 demonstrates the ability of hBN waveguides to collect light emitted by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dark excitons and trions. In&#8208;depth numerical simulations explore the parameters of dipole placement and total slab thickness, elucidating the critical design parameters and serving as a guide for novel devices implementing hBN slab waveguides that broaden the 2D material toolkit. Our results provide a direct route for waveguide&#8208;based interrogation of layered materials, as well as a way to integrate layered materials into future photonic devices at arbitrary positions whilst maintaining their intrinsic properties.

         <title>Comprehensive Qualitative and Quantitative Colorimetric Sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds Using Monolayered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cross&#8208;responsive chemical sensors are in high demand owing to their ability to distinguish a broad range of analytes. In this study, we develop a vapochromic sensor array based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibits distinct patterns when exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and humidity. Conventional sensor arrays consist of various receptors that produce different responses. Our vapochromic MOF&#8208;based sensor comprises dicopper paddlewheel clusters and dimethylamine azobenzene as binary colorimetric sensing moieties. Upon exposure to VOCs, the constructed sensor encompasses a broad spectrum of colors, ranging from green to red. Furthermore, the color of the MOF is influenced by the solvent used during the pretreatment. Consequently, monolayered MOF thin films can be adapted to multicomponent array systems by immersing the MOF in different solvents. This system provides both qualitative and quantitative sensing, generating unique color patterns corresponding to specific VOC types. Notably, the sensor successfully discriminates each of 14 common VOCs and water, and accurately categorizes unknown samples. Moreover, the system undergoes reversible color changes in response to humidity, obviating the need for high&#8208;temperature regeneration steps. This novel approach offers insights into the versatile applications of MOFs by creating a colorimetric sensor array capable of detecting various analytes.

         <title>Exoskeleton Partial&#8208;Coated Stem Cells for Infarcted Myocardium Restoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exoskeletons are generated to produce partial&#8208;coated bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) as a novel biologic formulation with dual&#8208;sided characteristics. The exoskeleton side promotes cell viability and targeting, whereas the cell side retains the ability of cell adhesion and external secretion. With the synergism of increased survival, retention, and augmented paracrine secretion, the partial&#8208;coated BMSCs exhibit promising heart repair effects.








Abstract
The integration of abiotic materials with live cells has emerged as an exciting strategy for the control of cellular functions. Exoskeletons consisting ofmetal&#8211;organic frameworks are generated to produce partial&#8208;coated bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) to overcome low cell survival leading to disappointing effects for cell&#8208;based cardiac therapy. Partially coated exoskeletons can promote the survival of suspended BMSCs by integrating the support of exoskeletons and unimpaired cellular properties. In addition, partial exoskeletons exhibit protective effects against detrimental environmental conditions, including reactive oxygen species, pH changes, and osmotic pressure. The partial&#8208;coated cells exhibit increased intercellular adhesion forces to aggregate and adhere, promoting cell survival and preventing cell escape during cell therapy. The exoskeletons interact with cell surface receptors integrin &#945;5&#946;1, leading to augmented biological functions with profitable gene expression alteration, such as Vegfa, Cxcl12, and Adm. The partial&#8208;coated BMSCs display enhanced cell retention in infarcted myocardium through non&#8208;invasive intravenous injections. The repair of myocardial infarction has been achieved with improved cardiac function, myocardial angiogenesis, proliferation, and inhibition of cell apoptosis. This discovery advances the elucidation of potential molecular and cellular mechanisms for cell&#8208;exoskeleton interactions and benefits the rational design and manufacture of next&#8208;generation nanobiohybrids.

         <title>The Material World of 3D&#8208;Bioprinted and Microfluidic&#8208;Chip Models of Human Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials are essential components of disease models as they more precisely replicate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. In this review, the use of biomaterials in advanced 3D&#8208;bioprinted and microfluidic&#8208;chip in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are discussed, highlighting how mechanical and biochemical properties of the materials are explored to mimic the disease microenvironment in vitro.








Abstract
Biomaterials are extensively used to mimic cell&#8211;matrix interactions, which are essential for cell growth, function, and differentiation. This is particularly relevant when developing in vitro disease models of organs rich in extracellular matrix, like the liver. Liver disease involves a chronic wound&#8208;healing response with formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis. At early stages, liver disease can be reverted, but as disease progresses, reversion is no longer possible, and there is no cure. Research for new therapies is hampered by the lack of adequate models that replicate the mechanical properties and biochemical stimuli present in the fibrotic liver. Fibrosis is associated with changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix that directly influence cell behavior. Biomaterials could play an essential role in better emulating the disease microenvironment. In this paper, the recent and cutting&#8208;edge biomaterials used for creating in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are revised, in combination with cells, bioprinting, and/or microfluidics. These technologies have been instrumental to replicate the intricate structure of the unhealthy tissue and promote medium perfusion that improves cell growth and function, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of material hints and cell&#8211;material interactions in a tridimensional context is provided.

In this review, the use of biomaterials in advanced 3D-bioprinted and microfluidic-chip in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are discussed, highlighting how mechanical and biochemical properties of the materials are explored to mimic the disease microenvironment in vitro.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomaterials are extensively used to mimic cell&#8211;matrix interactions, which are essential for cell growth, function, and differentiation. This is particularly relevant when developing in vitro disease models of organs rich in extracellular matrix, like the liver. Liver disease involves a chronic wound-healing response with formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis. At early stages, liver disease can be reverted, but as disease progresses, reversion is no longer possible, and there is no cure. Research for new therapies is hampered by the lack of adequate models that replicate the mechanical properties and biochemical stimuli present in the fibrotic liver. Fibrosis is associated with changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix that directly influence cell behavior. Biomaterials could play an essential role in better emulating the disease microenvironment. In this paper, the recent and cutting-edge biomaterials used for creating in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are revised, in combination with cells, bioprinting, and/or microfluidics. These technologies have been instrumental to replicate the intricate structure of the unhealthy tissue and promote medium perfusion that improves cell growth and function, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of material hints and cell&#8211;material interactions in a tridimensional context is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting DNA Damage and Repair Machinery via Delivering WEE1 Inhibitor and Platinum (IV) Prodrugs to Stimulate STING Pathway for Maximizing Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticle loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775), which can increase DNA damage, activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, ultimately enhancing chemo&#8208;immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Moreover, the nanoparticle elicits long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors when combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Both cisplatin&#8208;based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)&#8208;based immunotherapy are the first&#8208;line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Cancer cells can develop resistance to cisplatin through extensive DNA repair, while a low response rate to ICBs is mostly due to the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and low PD&#8208;L1 expression. Herein, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP2) loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775) is designed. NP2 can be triggered by GSH in cancer cells, and the released MK1775 can inhibit the activity of WEE1 protein, which ultimately increases DNA damage by cisplatin. Genome&#8208;wide RNA sequencing first reveals that NP2 can inhibit DNA repair machinery by interfering with the cell cycle and significantly activate the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Tumor growth is significantly inhibited by NP2 in vivo. As innate and adaptive immune responses are stimulated, the immunosuppressive microenvironment is modified, and the &#8220;immune cold tumor&#8221; is transformed into an &#8220;immune hot tumor". In addition, NP2 can upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, thereby increasing the response rate of PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) and eliciting long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Energy Band Engineering Guided Design of Bidirectional Catalyst for Reversible Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and understanding of the relationship between structure and performance are essential. Under the guidance of energy band engineering, a highly efficient catalyst is designed and shows obvious bidirectional effect for CO2 redox. This work offers new avenues for designing excellent electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;CO2 batteries arouse great interest in the context of carbon neutralization, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 redox reaction kinetics at the cathode, which brings about formidable challenges such as high overpotential and low Coulombic efficiency. For the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and the understanding of the relationship between electron state and performance are essential for the CO2 redox. However, little attention is paid to it. In this work, using Co3S4 as a model system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adjusted d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band centers of Co3S4 with the introduction of Cu and sulfur vacancies are hybridized between CO2 and Li species, respectively, which is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the decomposition of Li2CO3, and the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of energy band engineering. As a result, a highly efficient bidirectional catalyst is produced and shows an ultra&#8208;small voltage gap of 0.73&#160;V and marvelous Coulombic efficiency&#160;of 92.6%, surpassing those of previous catalysts under similar conditions. This work presents an effective catalyst design and affords new insight into the high&#8208;performance cathode catalyst materials for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Regulated Nanoconfined Channels for Highly Effective Mechanical&#8211;Electrical Conversion in Proton Battery&#8208;Type Self&#8208;Powered Pressure Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by human skin, a mechanical&#8211;electrical conversion mechanism based on pressure&#8208;modulated nanoconfined channels is proposed. Based on this mechanism, a proton battery&#8208;type self&#8208;powered pressure sensor MoO3/GO[CNF/Ca]/activated carbon (AC) is designed with an excellent static/dynamic pressure response. The one&#8208;piece device design enables self&#8208;supply, miniaturization, and charge/discharge reuse, showing application potential in wearable electronics, health monitoring, and other fields.








Abstract
Battery&#8208;sensing&#8208;based all&#8208;in&#8208;one pressure sensors are generally successfully constructed by mimicking the information transfer of living organisms and the sensing behavior of human skin, possessing features such as low energy consumption and detection of low/high&#8208;frequency mechanical signals. To design high&#8208;performance all&#8208;in&#8208;one pressure sensors, a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms of such sensors is required. Here, a mechanical&#8211;electrical conversion mechanism based on pressure&#8208;modulated nanoconfined channels is proposed. Then, the mechanism of ion accelerated transport in graphene oxide (GO) nanoconfined channels under pressure is revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Based on this mechanism, a proton battery&#8208;type self&#8208;powered pressure sensor MoO3/GO[CNF/Ca]/activated carbon (AC) is designed with an open&#8208;circuit voltage stabilization of 0.648&#160;V, an ultrafast response/recovery time of 86.0&#160;ms/93.0&#160;ms, pressure detection ranges of up to 60.0&#160;kPa, and excellent static/dynamic pressure response. In addition, the one&#8208;piece device design enables self&#8208;supply, miniaturization, and charge/discharge reuse, showing application potential in wearable electronics, health monitoring, and other fields.

         <title>Bismuth And Chlorine Dual&#8208;Doped Perovskite Chloride as A Phase&#8208;Structure&#8208;Stable And Moisture&#8208;Resistant Solid Electrolyte for Chloride Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite chloride, an anion conductor, is a promising candidate to be a solid electrolyte for high&#8208;energy and sustainable chloride ion batteries (CIB). However, it suffers from poor structural stability at low temperature and in ambient conditions, which leads to its transformation from an ionic conductor to an insulator. Herein, a bismuth and chlorine dual doping strategy is developed to stabilize the cubic structure of CsSnCl3 in harsh environments. The as&#8208;prepared dual&#8208;doped CsSn0.9Bi0.1Cl3.1 material with an optimized composition maintains its cubic structure at the extremely low temperature of 213 K for 10 days and at 40% relative humidity for 50 days, while the undoped cubic material deteriorates and transforms to a monoclinic phase under these conditions in less than 1 day. Consequently, the dual doping achieves efficient chloride ion conduction that is superior to single bismuth doping due to the introduction of interstitial chlorine facilitating chloride ion transport. Importantly, the practicality of the as&#8208;prepared solid electrolyte is demonstrated in different symmetric solid cells and by various CIBs using the organic electrode couple, a multivalent metal chloride cathode, or a new high&#8208;voltage metal oxychloride cathode.

Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are one of the most promising anti&#8208;/deicing materials, yet they are limited by the low energy density and intermittent nature of the solar energy. Here, a coupling solution based on microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) that integrates photothermal effect and phase change thermal storage is proposed. We design dual&#8208;shell octahedral MPCMs with Cu2O as the first layer and three&#8208;dimensional Cu2&#8208;xS as the second layer for the first time. By morphology and phase manipulation of the Cu2&#8208;xS shell, the local surface plasmonic heating modulation of MPCMs is realized, and the MPCM reveals full&#8208;spectrum high absorption with a photothermal conversion efficiency up to 96.1%. The phase change temperature and enthalpy remain in good consistency after 200 cycles. Multifunctional photothermal phase&#8208;change superhydrophobic composite coatings are fabricated by combining the hydrolyzed and polycondensation product of octadecyl trichlorosilane and the dual&#8208;shell MPCM. The multifunctional coatings exhibit excellent anti&#8208;/deicing performance under low temperature and high humidity conditions. Our work not only provides a new approach for the design of high&#8208;performance MPCMs, but also opens up a avenue for the anti&#8208;icing application of photothermal phase&#8208;change superhydrophobic composite coatings.

&lt;p&gt;Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are one of the most promising anti-/deicing materials, yet they are limited by the low energy density and intermittent nature of the solar energy.

         <title>Universal Strategy for Inorganic Nanoparticle Incorporation into Mesoporous Liquid Crystal Polymer Particles</title>

Abstract
Developing inorganic&#8208;organic composite polymers necessitates a new strategy for effectively controlling shape and optical properties while accommodating guest materials, as conventional polymers primarily act as carriers for inorganic substances. Here, we introduce a universal approach utilizing mesoporous liquid crystal polymer particles (MLPs) to fabricate inorganic&#8208;organic composites. By leveraging the liquid crystal phase, we precisely control morphology and optical properties through the molecular&#8208;level arrangement of the host, here monomers. The controlled host material allows the synthesis of inorganic particles within the matrix or accommodation of pre&#8208;synthesized nano&#8208;inorganic particles, all while preserving the intrinsic properties of the host material. This composite material surpasses the functional capabilities of the polymer alone by sequentially integrating one or more inorganic materials, allowing for the incorporation of multiple functionalities within a single polymer particle. Furthermore, this approach effectively mitigates the drawbacks associated with guest materials resulting in a substantial enhancement of composite performance. The presented approach is anticipated to hold immense potential for various applications in optoelectronics, catalysis, and biosensing, addressing the evolving demands of our society.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;low Noise Level Infrared Quantum Dot Photodiodes with Self&#8208;Screenable Polymeric Optical Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum dot photodiodes (QPDs) have garnered significant attention because of their unparalleled near&#8208;infrared (NIR) detection capabilities, primarily attributable to their size&#8208;dependent bandgap tunability. Nevertheless, the broadband absorption spectrum of QPD engenders substantial noise floor within superfluous visible light regions, notably hindering their use in several emerging applications necessitating the detection of faint micro&#8208;light signals. To overcome these hurdles, we demonstrated a self&#8208;screenable NIR QPD featuring an internal optical filter with a thick polymeric interlayer to reduce electronic noise. This effectively screened out undesirable visible light regions while reducing the ionized defect owing to decreased density of state (DOS), yielding an extremely low dark current (&#8764;1010 A/cm2 at V = &#8722;1&#160;V). Consequently, the electronic noise spectral density was attained at levels below 10&#8722;27 &#8764; 10&#8722;28 A2/Hz, and responsivity (R) dropped to 92% within the visible light spectrum.

         <title>Reinforcing the Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium Metal Batteries Employing Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte based on trifluoromethoxybenzene cosolvent is proposed for lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes, through a comparative study of three fluorinated aromatic cosolvents. The generated solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on anodes and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in organic cation&#8208;derived species on cathodes enable stable cycling of Li/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cells.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, but the lack of sufficiently protective electrode/electrolyte interphases (EEIs) limits their cyclability. Herein, trifluoromethoxybenzene is proposed as a cosolvent for locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) to reinforce the EEIs. With a comparative study of a neat ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) and three LCILEs employing fluorobenzene, trifluoromethylbenzene, or trifluoromethoxybenzene as cosolvents, it is revealed that the fluorinated groups tethered to the benzene ring of the cosolvents not only affect the electrolytes&#8217; ionic conductivity and fluidity, but also the EEIs&#8217; composition via adjusting the contribution of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Emim+) and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion. Trifluoromethoxybenzene, as the optimal cosolvent, leads to a stable cycling of LMBs employing 5 mAh cm&#8722;2 lithium metal anodes (LMAs), 21&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05 (NCA) cathodes, and 4.2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolytes for 150 cycles with a remarkable capacity retention of 71%, thanks to a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on LMAs and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in Emim+&#8208;derived species on NCA cathodes. By contrast, the capacity retention under the same condition is only 16%, 46%, and 18% for the neat ILE and the LCILEs based on fluorobenzene and benzotrifluoride, respectively.

         <title>Facile Photopatterning of Perfusable Microchannels in Synthetic Hydrogels to Recreate Microphysiological Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a rapid, facile, and cost&#8208;effective method for engineering intricate 3D microchannels in hydrogels. Using UV&#8208;triggered cross&#8208;linking and low&#8208;cost photomasks, high&#8208;resolution patterns are achieved in 0.8&#160;s. Integrated into a microfluidic device, the platform supports human endothelial cell culture growth and functionality. This versatile technique streamlines biofabrication for advanced in vitro microphysiological models.








Abstract
The fabrication of perfusable hydrogels is crucial for recreating in vitro microphysiological environments. Existing strategies to fabricate complex microchannels in hydrogels involve sophisticated equipment/techniques. A cost&#8208;effective, facile, versatile, and ultra&#8208;fast methodology is reported to fabricate perfusable microchannels of complex shapes in photopolymerizable hydrogels without the need of specialized equipment or sophisticated protocols. The methodology utilizes one&#8208;step ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;triggered cross&#8208;linking and a photomask printed on inexpensive transparent films to photopattern PEG&#8208;norbornene hydrogels. Complex and intricate patterns with high resolution, including perfusable microchannels, can be fabricated in &lt;1&#160;s. The perfusable hydrogel is integrated into a custom&#8208;made microfluidic device that permits connection to external pump systems, allowing continuous fluid perfusion into the microchannels. Under dynamic culture, human endothelial cells form a functional and confluent endothelial monolayer that remains viable for at least 7 days and respond to inflammatory stimuli. Finally, approach to photopattern norbornene hyaluronic acid hydrogels is adapted, highlighting the versatility of the technique. This study presents an innovative strategy to simplify and reduce the cost of biofabrication techniques for developing functional in vitro models using perfusable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogels.

&lt;p&gt;The study introduces a rapid, facile, and cost-effective method for engineering intricate 3D microchannels in hydrogels. Using UV-triggered cross-linking and low-cost photomasks, high-resolution patterns are achieved in 0.8&#160;s. Integrated into a microfluidic device, the platform supports human endothelial cell culture growth and functionality. This versatile technique streamlines biofabrication for advanced in vitro microphysiological models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of perfusable hydrogels is crucial for recreating in vitro microphysiological environments. Existing strategies to fabricate complex microchannels in hydrogels involve sophisticated equipment/techniques. A cost-effective, facile, versatile, and ultra-fast methodology is reported to fabricate perfusable microchannels of complex shapes in photopolymerizable hydrogels without the need of specialized equipment or sophisticated protocols. The methodology utilizes one-step ultraviolet (UV) light-triggered cross-linking and a photomask printed on inexpensive transparent films to photopattern PEG-norbornene hydrogels. Complex and intricate patterns with high resolution, including perfusable microchannels, can be fabricated in &amp;lt;1&#160;s. The perfusable hydrogel is integrated into a custom-made microfluidic device that permits connection to external pump systems, allowing continuous fluid perfusion into the microchannels. Under dynamic culture, human endothelial cells form a functional and confluent endothelial monolayer that remains viable for at least 7 days and respond to inflammatory stimuli. Finally, approach to photopattern norbornene hyaluronic acid hydrogels is adapted, highlighting the versatility of the technique. This study presents an innovative strategy to simplify and reduce the cost of biofabrication techniques for developing functional in vitro models using perfusable three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels. The approach offers a novel solution to overcome the complexities associated with existing methods, allowing engineering advanced in vitro microphysiological environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing Manufacturing of Lithium Batteries: Prospects and Challenges Toward Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The manufacturing and assembly of components within cells have a direct impact on the sample performance. Conventional processes restrict the shapes, dimensions, and structures of the commercially available batteries. Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing, a novel manufacturing process for precision and practicality, is expected to revolutionize the lithium battery industry owing to its advantages of customization, mechanization, and intelligence. This technique can be used to effectively construct intricate 3D structures that enhance the designability, integrity, and electrochemical performance of both liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. In this study, we provide an overview of the development of 3D printing technologies and assess their suitability for comparison with conventional printing processes. Various 3D printing technologies applicable to lithium&#8208;ion batteries have been systematically introduced, especially more practical composite printing technologies. The practicality, limitations, and optimization of 3D printing are discussed dialectically for various battery modules, including electrodes, electrolytes, and functional architectures. In addition, all&#8208;printed batteries are emphatically introduced. Finally, the prospects and challenges of 3D printing in the battery industry were evaluated.

         <title>Synergistic Pharmacological Therapy to Modulate Glial Cells in Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current treatments for modulating the glial&#8208;mediated inflammatory response after spinal cord injury (SCI) have limited ability to improve recovery. This is quite likely due to the lack of a selective therapeutic approach acting on microgliosis and astrocytosis, the glia components most involved after trauma, while maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects. We have developed and characterized a new nanogel that can selectively release active compounds in microglial cells and astrocytes. We evaluated the degree of selectivity and subcellular distribution of the nanogel by applying an innovative super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique, expansion microscopy. We then tested two different administration schemes in a SCI mouse model: in an early phase, the nanogel loaded with Rolipram, an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, achieved significant improvement in the animal's motor performance due to the increased recruitment of microglia and macrophages that were able to localize the lesion. Treatment in the late phase, however, gave opposite results, with worse motor recovery because of the widespread degeneration. These findings demonstrate that the nanovector can be selective and functional in the treatment of the glial component in different phases of SCI. They also open a new therapeutic scenario for tackling glia&#8208;mediated inflammation after neurodegenerative events in the central nervous system.

         <title>Waste Thermosetting Polyimide Resins into High&#8208;Performance And Sustainable Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistance Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thermosetting polyimide has attracted extensive attention for its excellent properties, but the approaches to its end&#8208;of&#8208;life management are not sustainable, posing great threat to the ecosystem. Herein, we propose a mild, sustainable and full recovery path for recycling waste carbon fiber reinforced phenylethynyl end&#8208;capped polyimide resin composites. In addition to recycling reaction reagent and woven carbon fiber, degraded products (DPETI) can be fully and directly used as high&#8208;performance and sustainable adhesives. DPETI exhibit strong adhesion to various surfaces, with a maximum adhesion strength of 1.84&#160;MPa. Due to the strong supramolecular polymerization behavior without solvent dependence, DPETI demonstrates higher adhesive strength of 2.22&#160;MPa in the extreme environment (&#8208;196&#730;C), which is maintained even after ten cycles. This work sparks a new thinking for plastic waste recycling that is to convert unrecyclable wastes into new and sustainable materials, which has the potential to establish new links within circular economies and influence the development of materials science.

         <title>Regulating Crystal Orientation via Ligand Anchoring Enables Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed, which significantly promotes the desired (001) crystal orientation. Thus, opaque and semitransparent 1.66 eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells realize efficiencies of 22.40% and 20.13%, respectively. Furthermore, four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells deliver a remarkable efficiency of 28.06%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications in tandem solar cells. However, the predominant obstacles impeding their widespread adoption are substantial open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation. To tackle these challenges, a crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed. This method significantly promotes the desired crystal orientation, passivates defects, and mitigates photo&#8208;induced halide phase segregation in perovskite films, leading to substantially reduced nonradiative recombination, minimized VOC deficits, and enhanced operational stability of the devices. The resulting 1.66&#160;eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% (certified at 21.97%), with the smallest VOC deficit recorded at 0.39&#160;V. Furthermore, the fabricated semitransparent WBG devices exhibit a competitive PCE of 20.13%. Consequently, four&#8208;terminal tandem cells comprising WBG perovskite top cells and 1.25&#160;eV bandgap perovskite bottom cells showcase an impressive PCE of 28.06% (stabilized 27.92%), demonstrating great potential for efficient multijunction tandem solar cell applications.

         <title>3D Printed Cellulose Nanofiber Aerogel Scaffold with Hierarchical Porous Structures for Fast Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based bilayer scaffold for atmospheric water harvesting has been developed through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying, which introduces both a&#160;millimeter&#8208;sized grid structure for water sorption and evaporation enhancement, and a micrometer&#8208;sized pore structure for lithium chloride confinement. Benefiting from the milli/micrometer pore structures, the scaffold shows an excellent water sorption/release performance and good cyclic stability.








Abstract
Hygroscopic salt&#8208;based composite sorbents are considered ideal candidates for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The primary challenge for the sorbents lies in exposing more hygroscopically active sites to the surrounding air while preventing salt leakage. Herein, a hierarchically structured scaffold is constructed by integrating cellulose nanofiber and lithium chloride (LiCl) as building blocks through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying. The milli/micrometer multiscale pores can effectively confine LiCl and simultaneously provide a more exposed active area for water sorption and release, accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D printed structure. Compared to a conventional freeze&#8208;dried aerogel, the 3D printed scaffold exhibits a water sorption rate that is increased 1.6&#8208;fold, along with a more than 2.4&#8208;fold greater water release rate. An array of bilayer scaffolds is demonstrated, which can produce 0.63&#160;g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 of water outdoors under natural sunlight. This article provides a sustainable strategy for collecting freshwater from the atmosphere.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Hetero[6]helicenes Showing Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Toward High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical extension strategy is introduced to engineer deep&#8208;blue hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters for circularly polarized OLEDs. Besides satisfactory chiroptical performance, this strategy endows the emitters with enhanced quantum yield and narrower emission bands compared to their precursor. The devices display record efficiencies, high color purity, and distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, marking a significant advance in chiroptical materials for high&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
Helicenes exhibit substantial potential as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active molecules. However, their application in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) is typically hindered by the challenge of integrating both high color purity and efficient triplet&#8208;harvesting capability, particularly in the blue spectral region. Herein, a series of hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters that is strategically engineered through the helical extension of a deep&#8208;blue double&#8208;boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) motif, is introduced. Importantly, the helical extension does not cause apparent structural deformation or perturb frontier molecular orbitals; thus, preserving the deep&#8208;blue emission and MR&#8208;TADF characteristics of the parent molecule. This approach also leads to reduced reorganization energy, resulting in emitters with narrower linewidth and higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Further, the helical motif enhances the racemization barrier and leads to improved CPL performance with luminescence dissymmetry factor values up to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Exploiting these merits, devices incorporating the chiral dopants demonstrate deep&#8208;blue emission within the Broadcast Service Television 2020 color&#8208;gamut range, record external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 29.3%, and have distinctive circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals. Overall, the authors&#8217; findings underscore the helical extension as a promising strategy for designing narrowband chiroptical materials and advancing high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Bimetallic&#8208;MOF Derived Carbon with Single Pt Anchored C4 Atomic Group Constructing Super Fuel Cell with Ultrahigh Power Density And Self&#8208;Change Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new super fuel cell (SFC) with single&#8208;atomic Pt on hollow porous carbon nanorods catalyst has super&#8208;high output ability through two creations of &#8220;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) + electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC)&#8221; parallel discharging and self&#8208;charging to overcome sluggish ORR process. The promising SFC offers a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.








Abstract
Pursuing high power density with low platinum catalysts loading is a huge challenge for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cells (FCs). Herein, a new super fuel cell (SFC) is proposed with ultrahigh output power via specific electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) + oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) parallel discharge, which is achieved using the newly prepared catalyst, single&#8208;atomic platinum on bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hollow porous carbon nanorods (PtSA/HPCNR). The PtSA&#8208;1.74/HPCNR&#8208;based SFC has a 3.4&#8208;time higher transient specific power density and 13.3&#8208;time longer discharge time with unique in situ self&#8208;charge and energy storage ability than 20% Pt/C&#8208;based FCs. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscope, and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored on carbon defects significantly boosts its electron transfer, ORR catalytic activity, durability, and rate performance, realizing rapid &#8220; ORR+EDLC&#8221; parallel discharge mechanism to overcome the sluggish ORR process of traditional FCs. The promising SFC leads to a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.

         <title>Selenophene Substitution Enabled High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Glucose Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With selenophene substitution, the resulting polymers demonstrate enhanced charge transport properties and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities, resulting in unprecedented performance for n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors. These advancements hold great promise for various biosensing applications, exemplified by the successful development of a highly sensitive glucose sensor.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n&#8208;type polymers (f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene&#8208;based counterpart as the control, it is demonstrated that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, boosted charge&#8208;transport properties, and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities. Therefore, a remarkable volumetric capacitance (C*) of 387.2 F cm&#8722;3 and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECT electron mobility (&#181;e,OECT) of 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are synchronously achieved for f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN having the highest selenophene content, yielding an unprecedented geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 71.4 S cm&#8722;1 and record figure of merit (&#181;C*) value of 191.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type OECTs. Thanks to such excellent performance of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN&#8208;based OECTs, a glucose sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 10&#160;nMm and decent selectivity is further implemented, demonstrating the power of selenophene substitution strategy in enabling high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type PMIECs for biosensing applications.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Current 10 nm Spin Hall Nano&#8208;Oscillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nano&#8208;constriction based spin Hall nano&#8208;oscillators (SHNOs) are at the forefront of spintronics research for emerging technological applications such as oscillator&#8208;based neuromorphic computing and Ising Machines. However, their miniaturization to the sub&#8208;50 nm width regime results in poor scaling of the threshold current. Here, we&#160;show that current shunting through the Si substrate is the origin of this problem and study how different seed layers can mitigate it. We&#160;find that an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 seed layer and SiN (200 nm) coated p&#8208;Si substrates provide the best improvement, enabling us to scale down the SHNO width to a truly nanoscopic dimension of 10 nm, operating at threshold currents below 30 &#181;A. In addition, the combination of electrical insulation and high thermal conductivity of the Al2O3 seed will offer the best conditions for large SHNO arrays, avoiding any significant temperature gradients within the array. Our&#160;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low operational current SHNOs hence pave an energy&#8208;efficient route to scale oscillator&#8208;based computing to large dynamical neural networks of linear chains or two&#8208;dimensional&#160;arrays.

         <title>Regioselective Growth of Colloidal Crystals Induced by Depletion Attraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal crystals display photonic stopbands that generate reflective structural colors. While micropatterning offers significant value for various applications, the resolution is somewhat limited for conventional top&#8208;down approaches. In this work, we introduce a simple, single&#8208;step bottom&#8208;up approach to produce photonic micropatterns through depletion&#8208;mediated regioselective growth of colloidal crystals. We employ lithographically&#8208;featured micropatterns with planar surfaces and nano&#8208;needle arrays as substrates. Heterogeneous nucleation is drastically suppressed on nano&#8208;needle arrays due to minimal particle&#8208;to&#8208;needles overlap of excluded volumes, while it is promoted on planar surfaces with large particle&#8208;to&#8208;plane volume overlap, enabling regioselective growth of colloidal crystals. This strategy allows high&#8208;resolution micropatterning of colloidal photonic crystals, with a minimum feature size as small as 10 &#956;m. Stopband positions, or structural colors, are controllable through concentration and depletant and salt, as well as particle size. Notably, we can create secondary colors through structural color mixing by simultaneously crystallizing two different particle sizes into their own crystal grains, resulting in two distinct reflectance peaks at controlled wavelengths. Our simple and highly reproducible method for regioselective colloidal crystallization provides a general route for designing elaborate photonic micropatterns suitable for various applications.

&lt;p&gt;Colloidal crystals display photonic stopbands that generate reflective structural colors. While micropatterning offers significant value for various applications, the resolution is somewhat limited for conventional top-down approaches. In this work, we introduce a simple, single-step bottom-up approach to produce photonic micropatterns through depletion-mediated regioselective growth of colloidal crystals. We employ lithographically-featured micropatterns with planar surfaces and nano-needle arrays as substrates. Heterogeneous nucleation is drastically suppressed on nano-needle arrays due to minimal particle-to-needles overlap of excluded volumes, while it is promoted on planar surfaces with large particle-to-plane volume overlap, enabling regioselective growth of colloidal crystals. This strategy allows high-resolution micropatterning of colloidal photonic crystals, with a minimum feature size as small as 10 &#956;m. Stopband positions, or structural colors, are controllable through concentration and depletant and salt, as well as particle size. Notably, we can create secondary colors through structural color mixing by simultaneously crystallizing two different particle sizes into their own crystal grains, resulting in two distinct reflectance peaks at controlled wavelengths.

         <title>Multifunctional Separator Enables High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Sodium metal has become one of the most promising anodes for next&#8208;generation cheap and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries; however, challenges caused by the uncontrollable sodium dendrites growth and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) restrict their large&#8208;scale practical applications in low&#8208;cost and wide&#8208;voltage&#8208;window carbonate electrolytes. Herein, a novel multifunctional separator with lightweight and high thinness is proposed, assembled by the cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework nanowires (Co&#8208;NWS), to replace the widely applied thick and heavy glass fiber separator. Benefitting from its abundant sodiophilic functional groups and densely stacked nanowires, Co&#8208;NWS not only exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability and effectively induces uniform Na+ ions flux as a strong ion&#8208;redistributor but also favors constructing the robust N,F&#8208;rich SEI layer. Satisfactorily, with 10&#160;&#956;L carbonate electrolyte, a Na|Co&#8208;NWS|Cu half&#8208;cell delivers stable cycling (over 260 cycles) with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98%, and the symmetric cell shows a long cycle life of more than 500&#160;h. Remarkably, the full cell shows a long&#8208;term lifespan (over 1500 cycles with 92% capacity retention) at high current density in the carbonate electrolyte. This work opens up a strategy for developing dendrites&#8208;free, low&#8208;cost, and long&#8208;lifespan SMBs in carbonate electrolytes.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors Achieved by Optimizing Structural and Energetic Ordering of Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For optimizing steady&#8208;state performance in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), both molecular design and structural alignment approaches must work in tandem to minimize energetic and microstructural disorders in polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor films. Herein, a series of poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole)s bearing various lengths of aliphatic&#8211;glycol hybrid side chains (PDPP&#8208;mEG; m = 2&#8211;5) are developed to achieve high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OECTs. PDPP&#8208;4EG polymer with the optimized length of side chains exhibits excellent crystallinity owing to enhanced lamellar and backbone interactions. Furthermore, the improved structural ordering in PDPP&#8208;4EG films significantly decreases trap state density and energetic disorder. Consequently, PDPP&#8208;4EG&#8208;based OECT devices produce a mobility&#8211;volumetric capacitance product ([&#956;C*]) of 702 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a hole mobility of 6.49 &#177; 0.60 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Finally, for achieving the optimal structural ordering along the OECT channel direction, a floating film transfer method is employed to reinforce the unidirectional orientation of polymer chains, leading to a substantially increased figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit [&#956;C*] to over 800 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Our research demonstrates the importance of side chain engineering of polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in conjunction with their anisotropic microstructural optimization to maximize OECT characteristics.

         <title>A Ternary (P, Se, S) Covalent Inorganic Framework as A Shuttle Effect&#8208;Free Cathode for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing new cathode materials to avoid shuttle effect of Li&#8208;S batteries at source is crucial for practical high&#8208;energy applications, which, however, remains a great challenge. Herein, a new class of sulfur&#8208;containing ternary covalent inorganic framework (CIF), P4Se6S40, is explored, by simply co&#8208;melting powders of P, S and Se. The P4Se6S40 CIF with open framework enables all active sites available during electrochemical reactions, giving a high capacity delivery. Moreover, the introducing of Se atoms can improve intrinsic electronic conductivity of S chains yet without remarkably compromising the capacity because Se is also electrochemical active to lithium storage. More importantly, Se atoms in S&#8208;Se chains can serve as a heteroatom battier to block the bonding of S atoms around, effectively avoiding the formation of long&#8208;chain polysulfides during cycling. Besides, stable Li3PS4 with a tetrahedral configuration formed after lithiation works as not only a good ionic conductor to promote Li ion diffusion, but a three&#8208;dimensional spatial barrier and chemical anchor to suppress the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides, further inhibiting the shuttle effect. Consequently, the P4Se6S40 cathode delivers high capacity and excellent capacity retention with even a high loading of 10.5 mg cm&#8722;2 which far surpasses the requirement for commercial applications.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Plasma Membrane and Mitochondria Dual&#8208;Targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE Photosensitizer Evoking Synergetic Pyroptosis and Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Phototherapy provides a noninvasive and spatiotemporal controllable paradigm to inhibit the evasion of the programmed cell death (PCD) of tumors. However, conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often induce a single PCD process, resulting in insufficient photodamage and severely impeding their application scopes. In this study, molecular engineering is conducted by adjusting electron donors to develop an aggregation&#8208;induced NIR&#8208;II emissive PS (DPITQ) for plasma membrane and mitochondria dual&#8208;targeted hypoxic tumor therapy by evoking synergetic pyroptosis and apoptosis. DPITQ displays boosted type I and II reactive oxygen species generation as well as a high photothermal conversion efficacy (43%) after laser irradiation of 635 nm. The excellent biocompatibility and appropriate lipophilicity helps the DPITQ to specifically anchor in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of cancer cells in intricate biological scenarios. Furthermore, the photosensitized DPITQ could disrupt the intact plasma membrane and cause mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately causing concurrent pyroptosis and apoptosis to suppress cancer cell proliferation even under hypoxia. It is noteworthy that the DPITQ nanoparticles (NPs) presented clear NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability on the venous vessels of nude mice. Notably, the DPITQ NPs exerted efficient NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy both in multicellular tumor spheroids and in vivo, causing maximum destruction to tumors but minimum adverse effects to normal tissue.

         <title>Construction of Two&#8208;Dimensional S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconductor photocatalytic technology holds immense promise for converting sustainable solar energy into chemically storable energy, with significant applications in the realms of energy and the environment. However, the inherent issue of rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes hinders the performance of single photocatalysts. To overcome this challenge, the construction of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts has emerged as an effective strategy. The deliberate design of dimensionality ensures a substantial interfacial area, while the S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism facilitates efficient charge separation and maximizes redox capabilities. This review commences with a fresh perspective on the charge transfer mechanism in S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, followed by a comprehensive exploration of preparation methods and characterization techniques. Subsequently, the recent advancements in 2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are summarized. Notably, the mechanism behind activity enhancement is elucidated. Finally, the prospects for the development of 2D S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts are presented.

This review commences with a fresh perspective on the charge transfer mechanism in S-scheme heterojunctions, followed by a comprehensive exploration of preparation methods and characterization techniques. Subsequently, the recent advancements in 2D S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are summarized. Notably, the mechanism behind activity enhancement is elucidated. Finally, the prospects for the development of 2D S-scheme photocatalysts are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Preshaped 4D Photocurable Ultratough Organogel Microcoils for Personalized Endovascular Embolization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a photocurable shape memory organogel is proposed, and used it to fabricate the preshaped 4D microcoil for personalized endovascular embolization. This microcoil demonstrates rapid shape transformation within seconds at body temperature. Once inserted into the rabbit's carotid artery, the 4D organogel microcoil can immediately block the abnormal blood inside the aneurysm.








Abstract
Endovascular embolization using microcoils can be an effective technique to treat artery aneurysms. However, microcoils with fixed designs are difficult to adapt to all aneurysm types. In this paper, a photocurable ultratough shape memory organogel with a curing time of only 2 s and megapascal&#8208;level mechanical properties is proposed. Then, it is used to manufacture the personalized 4D microcoil with a wire diameter of only 0.3&#160;mm. The improved mechanical modulus (511.63&#160;MPa) can reduce the possibility of microcoils&#8217; fracture during embolization. Besides, the fast body&#8208;temperature&#8208;triggering shape memory ability makes the 4D microcoil applicable in vivo. These 4D microcoils are finally delivered into the rabbit, and successfully blocked the blood flow inside different aneurysms, with neoendothelial cells and collagen fibers growing on the microcoil surface snugly, indicating full aneurysm recovery. This 4D organogel microcoil can potentially be used in personalized clinical translation on human beings.

         <title>High&#8208;Reversibility Sulfur Anode for Advanced Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8596;Na2S conversion is identified as a promising anodic reaction with low potential. The viability of S anode is established in S&#8211;I2 battery that uses a cost&#8208;effective and scalable sulfonated polysulfone membrane to mitigate &#8220;shuttle effects.&#8221; Compared to Zn anode, S anode avoids dendrite formation and hydrogen evolution, and it can withstand super&#8208;high utilization (100% vs &lt; 1% for Zn).








Abstract
Despite being extensively explored as cathodes in batteries, sulfur (S) can function as a low&#8208;potential anode by changing charge carriers in electrolytes. Here, a highly reversible S anode that fully converts from S80 to S2&#8722; in static aqueous S&#8211;I2 batteries by using Na+ as the charge carrier is reported. This S anode exhibits a low potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V (vs standard hydrogen electrode) and a near&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity of 1404&#160;mA h g&#8722;1. Importantly, it shows significant advantages over the widely used Zn anode in aqueous media by obviating dendrite formation and H2 evolution. To suppress &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; faced by both S and I2 electrodes, a scalable sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) membrane is proposed, which is superior to commercial Nafion in cost (US$1.82 m&#8722;2&#160;vs $3500 m&#8722;2) and environmental benignity. Because of its ultra&#8208;high selectivity in blocking polysulfides/iodides, the battery with SPSF displays excellent cycling stability. Even under 100% depth of discharge, the battery demonstrates high capacity retention of 87.6% over 500 cycles, outperforming Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with 3.1% capacity under the same conditions. These findings broaden anode options beyond metals for high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost, and fast&#8208;chargeable batteries.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Lipid&#8208;Based Nanoparticles: Selective Behavior At The Nano&#8208;Bio Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The membrane&#8208;protein interface on lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles influences their in vivo behavior. Better understanding may evolve current drug delivery methods towards effective targeted nanomedicine. Previously, we demonstrated the cell&#8208;specific accumulation of a liposome formulation in vivo, through the selective recognition of lipid phase separation by triglyceride lipases. This exemplified how liposome morphology and composition can determine nanoparticle&#8208;protein interactions. Here, we investigate the lipase&#8208;induced compositional and morphological changes of phase&#8208;separated liposomes &#8211; which bear a lipid droplet in their bilayer &#8211; and unravel how lipases recognize and bind to the particles. We observe the selective lipolytic degradation of the phase&#8208;separated lipid droplet, while nanoparticle integrity remains intact. Next, we identify the Tryptophan&#8208;rich loop of the lipase &#8211; a region responsible for endogenous lipoprotein binding &#8211; as the region with which the enzymes bind to the particles. This preferential binding is due to lipid packing defects induced on the liposome surface by phase separation. In parallel, we build upon the existing knowledge that phase separation leads to in vivo selectivity, to generate phase&#8208;separated mRNA&#8208;LNPs that target cell subsets in zebrafish embryos, with subsequent mRNA delivery and protein expression. Together, these findings can expand our current knowledge on selective nanoparticle&#8208;protein communications and in vivo behavior, aspects that will assist to gain control of lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles.

         <title>Suppressing Oxidation at Perovskite&#8211;NiOx Interface for Efficient and Stable Tin Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells are developed by modifying the buried interface between perovskite and NiOx via self&#8208;assembled monolayer molecule (4&#8208;(7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid, which achieve a record power conversion efficiency of 14.19% for small&#8208;area device and 12.05% for large&#8208;area (1 cm2) device.








Abstract
Inorganic nickel oxide (NiOx) is an ideal hole transport material (HTM) for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency, stable, and large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaic devices because of its low cost, stability, and ease of solution processing. However, it delivers low power conversion efficiency (PCE) in tin perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) compared to other organic HTMs. Here, the origin of hole transport barriers at the perovskite&#8211;NiOx interface is identified and a self&#8208;assembled monolayer interface modification is developed, through introducing (4&#8208;(7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (2PADBC) into the perovskite&#8211;NiOx interface. The 2PADBC anchors undercoordinated Ni cations through phosphonic acid groups, suppressing the reaction of highly active Ni&#8805;3+ defects with perovskites, while increasing the electron density and oxidation activation energy of Sn at the perovskite interface, reducing the interface nonradiative recombination caused by tetravalent Sn defects. The devices deliver significantly increased open&#8208;circuit voltage from 0.712 to 0.825&#160;V, boosting the PCE to 14.19% for the small&#8208;area device and 12.05% for the large&#8208;area (1 cm2) device. In addition, the 2PADBC modification enhances the operational stability of NiOx&#8208;based TPSCs, maintaining more than 93% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h.

An in situ tumor vaccine is constructed to regulate the multiple events in the tumor immunity cycle: enhances antigen release by PTT and PDT; captures and delivers the released antigen, together with CpG, to APCs for antigen presentation; promotes T cell killing effect by combining with immune checkpoint inhibitor, thus significantly increasing the anti&#8208;tumor effectiveness on colorectal, liver and breast cancer.









Abstract
The immune response in cancer reflects a series of carefully regulated events; however, current tumor immunotherapies typically address a single key aspect to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In the present study, a nanoplatform (Fe3O4@IR820@CpG)&#8208;based immunotherapy strategy that targets the multiple key steps in cancer&#8208;immunity cycle is developed: 1) promotes the release of tumor&#8208;derived proteins (TDPs), including tumor&#8208;associated antigens and pro&#8208;immunostimulatory factors), in addition to the direct killing effect, by photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT); 2) captures the released TDPs and delivers them, together with CpG (a Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 agonist) to antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) to promote antigen presentation and T cell activation; 3) enhances the tumor&#8208;killing ability of T cells by combining with anti&#8208;programmed death ligand 1 antibody (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1), which collectively advances the outstanding of the anti&#8208;tumor effects on colorectal, liver and breast cancers. The broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;tumor activity of Fe3O4@IR820@CpG with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 demonstrates that optimally manipulating anti&#8208;cancer immunity not singly but as a group provides promising clinical strategies.

         <title>Minimizing Interfacial Recombination in 1.8&#160;Ev Triple&#8208;Halide Perovskites for 27.2% Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells show great potential to enable highest performances at reasonable costs for a viable market entry in the near future. In particular, wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) are essential to further improve the tandem solar cells&#8217; performance. Here, we develop a new 1.8&#160;eV bandgap triple&#8208;halide perovskite composition in conjunction with a piperazinium iodide (PI) surface treatment. With structural analysis, we find that the PI modifies the surface through a reduction of excess lead iodide in the perovskite and additionally penetrates the bulk. Constant Light&#8208;Induced Magneto Transport (CLIMAT) measurements were applied to separately resolve charge carrier properties of electrons and holes. These measurements reveal a reduced deep trap state density, and improved steady&#8208;state carrier lifetime (factor 2.6) and diffusion lengths (factor 1.6). As a result, WBG PSCs achieve 1.36&#160;V VOC, reaching 90% of the radiative limit. Combined with a 1.26&#160;eV NBG perovskite with a rubidium iodide additive, this enables a tandem cell with certified efficiency of 27.5%.

Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as powerful building blocks to develop various soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, superior bio&#8208;compatibility, the ability to conduct both electrons and ions, and multiple stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. However, hydrogels are vulnerable to mechanical damage, which limits their usage in developing durable hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics. Self&#8208;healing hydrogels aim to endow bioelectronics with the property of repairing specific functions after mechanical failure, thus improving their durability, reliability, and longevity. This review discusses recent advances in self&#8208;healing hydrogels, from the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, material chemistry, and strategies for multiple properties improvement of hydrogel materials, to the design, fabrication, and applications of various hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics, including wearable physical and biochemical sensors, supercapacitors, flexible display devices, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), implantable bioelectronics, etc. Furthermore, the persisting challenges hampering the development of self&#8208;healing hydrogel bioelectronics and their prospects are proposed. This review is expected to expedite the research and applications of self&#8208;healing hydrogels for various self&#8208;healing bioelectronics.

         <title>Engineered Synthetic Matrices for Human Intestinal Organoid Culture And Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling in vitro, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration and therapeutic advances in vivo. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and differentiation. These hydrogels allow for tuning the mechanical and biochemical properties of the matrix, offering an advantage over biologically derived hydrogels such as MatrigelTM. Human intestinal organoids have been used for repopulating transplantable intestinal grafts and for in vivo delivery to an injured intestinal site. The use of synthetic hydrogels for in vitro culture and for in vivo delivery is expected to significantly increase the relevance of human intestinal organoids for drug screening, disease modeling, and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Adaptive Neural Activation and Neuromorphic Processing via Drain&#8208;Injection Threshold&#8208;Switching Float Gate Transistor Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D float gate transistor with steep threshold memory switching behavior is developed by modifying its semiconductor channel in to depletion mode. The device displays potential in emulating complex hetero&#8208;modulated neuron functions, including integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire and sigmoid type non&#8208;linear activation, which are applied to realize visual recognition tasks in biomimetic manner.








Abstract
Hetero&#8208;modulated neural activation is vital for adaptive information processing and learning that occurs in brain. To implement brain&#8208;inspired adaptive processing, previously various neurotransistors oriented for synaptic functions are extensively explored, however, the emulation of nonlinear neural activation and hetero&#8208;modulated behaviors are not possible due to the lack of threshold switching behavior in a conventional transistor structure. Here, a 2D van der Waals float gate transistor (FGT) that exhibits steep threshold switching behavior, and the emulation of hetero&#8208;modulated neuron functions (integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire, sigmoid type activation) for adaptive sensory processing, are reported. Unlike conventional FGTs, the threshold switching behavior stems from impact ionization in channel and the coupled charge injection to float gate. When a threshold is met, a sub&#8208;30&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 increase of transistor conductance by more than four orders is triggered with a typical switch time of approximately milliseconds. Essentially, by feeding light sensing signal as the modulation input, it is demonstrated that two typical tasks that rely on adaptive neural activation, including collision avoidance and adaptive visual perception, can be realized. These results may shed light on the emulation of rich hetero&#8208;modulating behaviors in biological neurons and the realization of biomimetic neuromorphic processing at low hardware cost.

         <title>Amphoteric Ion Bridged Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphoteric organic salt, 4FPEAPSA, is applied as the buried interface bridged layer to induce large&#8208;grain perovskite film with uniform morphology. 4FPEAPSA treatment can facilitate the matchable energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface, reducing defect recombination loss. Such a multi&#8208;functional bridged layer enables a high efficiency of 25.03% and preferable stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs).








Abstract
Synergistic morphology and defects management at the buried perovskite interface are challenging but crucial for the further improvement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Herein, an amphoteric organic salt, 2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethylammonium&#8208;4&#8208;methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA), is designed to optimize the film morphology and energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface. 4FPEAPSA treatment promotes the growth of a void&#8208;free, coarse&#8208;grained, and hydrophobic film by inducing the crystal orientation. Besides, the dual&#8208;functional 4FPEAPSA can chemically interact with the perovskite film, and passivate the defects of iodine and formamidine vacancies, tending to revert the fermi level of perovskite to its defect&#8208;free state. Meanwhile, the formation of a p&#8208;type doping buried interface can facilitate the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PerSCs for reduced carrier recombination loss. Consequently, 4FPEAPSA treatment improves the efficiency of the perovskite devices to 25.03% with better storage, heat, and humidity stability. This work contributes to strengthening the systematic understanding of the perovskite buried interface, providing a synergetic approach to realize precise morphology control, effective defect suppression, and energy level alignment for efficient PerSCs.

Such a multi-functional bridged layer enables a high efficiency of 25.03% and preferable stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergistic morphology and defects management at the buried perovskite interface are challenging but crucial for the further improvement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Herein, an amphoteric organic salt, 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylammonium-4-methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA), is designed to optimize the film morphology and energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface. 4FPEAPSA treatment promotes the growth of a void-free, coarse-grained, and hydrophobic film by inducing the crystal orientation. Besides, the dual-functional 4FPEAPSA can chemically interact with the perovskite film, and passivate the defects of iodine and formamidine vacancies, tending to revert the fermi level of perovskite to its defect-free state. Meanwhile, the formation of a p-type doping buried interface can facilitate the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PerSCs for reduced carrier recombination loss. Consequently, 4FPEAPSA treatment improves the efficiency of the perovskite devices to 25.03% with better storage, heat, and humidity stability. This work contributes to strengthening the systematic understanding of the perovskite buried interface, providing a synergetic approach to realize precise morphology control, effective defect suppression, and energy level alignment for efficient PerSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Modification of High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life LiCoO2 Cathode with Concentration Gradient Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The essence of the currently proposed one&#8208;step multi&#8208;modification strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode candidates&#160;lies in its &#8243;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8243; functionality, which systematically and comprehensively considers both the localized environment (e.g., TM&#9472;O bonding state, Li/Co migration pathway, TM&#8208;derived catalytic site for electrolyte decomposition) and the overall architecture (e.g., cathode/electrolyte interface reinforcement, gliding stacking faults reformation).








Abstract
Raising the charging cut&#8208;off voltage of layered oxide cathodes can improve their energy density. However, it inevitably introduces instabilities regarding both bulk structure and surface/interface. Herein, exploiting the unique characteristics of high&#8208;valence Nb5+ element, a synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk&#8208;modified LiCoO2 featuring Li3NbO4 surface coating layer, Nb&#8208;doped bulk, and the desired concentration gradient architecture through one&#8208;step calcination is achieved. Such a multifunctional structure facilitates the construction of high&#8208;quality cathode/electrolyte interface, enhances Li+ diffusion, and restrains lattice&#8208;O loss, Co migration, and associated layer&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase distortion. Therefore, a stable operation of Nb&#8208;modified LiCoO2 half&#8208;cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Long&#8208;life 250&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 550&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells assembled with graphite and thin Li anodes are harvested (both beyond 87% after 1600 and 200 cycles). This multifunctional one&#8208;step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion cathode materials.

         <title>Electrochemical Evolution of Ru&#8208;Based Polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;Codoped RuOx for Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils the synthesis of a robust, bifunctional electrocatalyst via the electrochemical evolution of Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx (RuSiW) for efficient acidic water splitting. Exploiting the synergistic effects of Si and W codoping, RuSiW catalyst achieves remarkable activity and stability for acidic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Despite intensive studies over decades, the development of electrocatalysts for acidic water splitting still relies on platinum group metals, especially Pt and Ir, which are scarce, expensive, and poorly sustainable. Because such problems can be alleviated, Ru&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts such as rutile RuO2 have recently emerged. However, RuO2 has a relatively low activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and low stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) under acidic conditions. In this study, the synthesis of a RuOx&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst (RuSiW) for acidic water splitting via the electrochemical evolution from Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates at cathodic potentials is reported. RuSiW consists of the nanocrystalline RuO2 core and Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx shell. RuSiW exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity comparable to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, with high stability. Computational analysis suggests that the codoping of RuOx with W and Si synergistically improves the HER activity of otherwise poor RuO2 by shifting the d&#8208;band center and optimizing atomic configurations beneficial for proper hydrogen adsorption. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis of unprecedented bifunctional electrocatalysts using catalytically inactive and less explored elements, such as Si and W.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Modulated Ionic Polymer as an Adaptable Electron Transport Material for Optically Switchable Pixel&#8208;Free Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer comprising photocrosslinkable moieties and electron transport moieties enables organic light&#8208;emitting devices to be switched by external optical direct writing and erasing. Independent solution&#8208;processed electron transport layer (ETL) using photo&#8208;modulated ionic polymer realizes the fabrication of optically switchable pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) with tunable illuminants and seamless imaging capability.








Abstract
In addition to electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED)&#160;displays that rely on complicated and costly circuits for switching individual pixel illumination, developing a facile approach that structures pixel&#8208;free light&#8208;emitting displays with exceptional precision and spatial resolution via external photo&#8208;modulation holds significant importance for advancing consumer electronics. Here, optically switchable organic light&#8208;emitting pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) are presented and fabricated by judiciously combining an adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer as electron transport materials (ETM) with external photo&#8208;modulation as the switching mode while ensuring superior illumination performance and seamless imaging capability. By irradiating the solution&#8208;processed OSPFDs with light at specific wavelengths, efficient and reversible tuning of both electron transport and electroluminescence is achieved simultaneously. This remarkable control is achieved by altering the energetic matching within OSPFDs, which also exhibits a high level of universality and adjustable flexibility in the three primary color&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting displays. Moreover, the ease of creating and erasing desired pixel&#8208;free emitting patterns through a non&#8208;invasive photopatterning process within a single OSPFD is demonstrated, thereby rendering this approach promising for commercial displaying devices and highly precise pixelated illuminants.

         <dc:description>
A roadmap for the regulatory approval of microneedles&#8208;based drug&#160;delivery systems is presented using a Quality by Design approach to pharmaceutical product development.&#160;In this regard, a quality target product profile and the critical quality attributes of microneedles are identified.&#160;A case study of a novel patented glass microneedle, ArrayPatch, is demonstrated by assessing the manufacturing readiness.








Abstract
In this paper, a roadmap is provided for the regulatory approval of one of the exciting and dynamic drug&#160;delivery fields,&#160;microneedles,&#160;by using a Quality by Design approach to pharmaceutical product development. In this regard, a quality target product profile (QTPP) and the critical quality attributes (CQA) of microneedles are identified. A case study of the recently patented method of fabricating glass microneedles&#160;entirely from a therapeutic agent, thus eliminating the requirement for additional excipients is discussed. The glass microneedle, ArrayPatch,&#160;is a propriety wearable device with platform potential consisting of an array of sharp, but painless, dissolvable microneedles manufactured with 100% drug. The microneedles penetrate the skin on application and dissolve to deliver a locally effective dose. The&#160;in&#160;vitro&#160;characterization of the microneedle CQAs under WHO&#8208;guided stability conditions will be described to assess the manufacturing readiness of ArrayPatch.&#160;&#160;A live technical video is also provided, presenting a unique procedure of jugular vein cannulation through the ear vein of a pig animal model to study the&#160;in vivo&#160;pharmacokinetics of ArrayPatch compared to standard&#8208;of&#8208;care marketed products.

Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) of high&#8208;performance structural ceramic components with comparative strength and toughness as conventionally manufactured ceramics remains challenging. Here, an UV&#8208;curing approach is integrated in direct ink writing (DIW), taking advantage from DIW to enable an easy use of high solid&#8208;loading pastes and multi&#8208;layered materials with compositional changes, while avoiding drying problems. UV&#8208;curable opaque zirconia&#8208;based slurries with a solid loading of 51 vol% were developed to fabricate dense and crack&#8208;free alumina&#8208;toughened zirconia (ATZ) containing 3 wt% alumina platelets. Importantly, a non&#8208;reactive diluent was added to relieve polymerization&#8208;induced internal stresses, avoid subsequent warping and cracking, and facilitate the de&#8208;binding. For the first time, UV&#8208;curing assisted DIW&#8208;printed ceramic after sintering revealed even better mechanical properties than that processed by a conventional pressing. This was attributed to the aligned alumina platelets, enhancing crack deflection and improving the fracture toughness from 6.8 &#177; 0.3&#160;MPa m0.5 (compacted) to 7.4 &#177; 0.3&#160;MPa m0.5 (DIW). The 4&#8208;point bending strength of the DIW ATZ (1009 &#177; 93&#160;MPa) was also higher than that of the conventionally manufactured equivalent (861 &#177; 68&#160;MPa). Beside homogeneous ceramic, laminate structures were demonstrated. This work has provided a valuable hybrid approach to additively manufacture tough and strong ceramic components.

         <title>In Situ Formation of 2D Perovskite Seeding for Record&#8208;Efficiency Indoor Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the issue of efficiency loss due to increased cell size for indoor perovskite photovoltaics by developing an in situ pre&#8208;nucleation strategy is addressed. A trace amount of &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, which spontaneously reacts with PbI2 to form 2D perovskite seed crystals to facilitate 3D perovskite growth.








Abstract
With 40% efficiency under room light intensity, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will be promising power supplies for low&#8208;light applications, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and indoor electronics, shall they become commercialized. Herein, &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is utilized to spontaneously form a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds for improved film uniformity, crystallization quality, and solar cell performance. It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10&#8208;fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small&#8208;area (0.09 cm2) PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large&#8208;area cells (1.00 cm2, and 2.56 cm2) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale&#8208;up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs (i&#8208;PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large&#8208;area printing technology.

         <title>Exciton Chirality Transfer Empowers Self&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Polarized Amplified Spontaneous Emission from 1D&#8208;Anchoring&#8208;3D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;triggered spin&#8208;polarized coherent light emission is achieved through stimulated emission of imbalanced spin population in the 3D@1D perovskites. The population is produced by exciton chirality transfer from chiral 1D perovskites to achiral 3D perovskites without external spin injection. The compositions of 3D@1D perovskites are tailored for broadband output of spin&#8208;polarized amplified spontaneous emission with distinct degree of polarization.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized lasers, arising from stimulated emission of imbalanced spin populations, play a vital role in spin&#8208;optoelectronics.&#160;It is usually tackled by external spin injection, inevitably suffering from additional losses across the barriers from injection sources to gain materials. Herein, spin&#8208;polarized coherent light emission is self&#8208;triggered from the 1D&#8208;anchoring&#8208;3D perovskites, where the imbalanced populations in achiral 3D perovskites are endowed with the spin selectivity of exciton chirality (EC) underpinned by chiral 1D perovskites. Efficient transfer of EC is enabled by rapid energy transfer, thereby creating an imbalance of the spin population of excited states. Stimulated emission of such populations brings self&#8208;triggered spin&#8208;polarized amplified spontaneous emission in the composite perovskites, yielding a higher degree of polarization (DOP) than that based on optical spin injection into bare achiral 3D perovskites. Chemical diversity of composite perovskites not only enables to adjust band gap for broadband output of spin&#8208;polarized light&#160;signals but also promises to manipulate radiative decay and spin relaxation toward remarkably increased DOP. These results highlight the importance of EC transfer mechanism for spin&#8208;polarized lasing and represent a crucial step toward the development of chiral&#8208;spintronics.

         <title>Unravelling Twin Topotactic/Nontopotactic Reactive TiSe2 Cathodes for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamically stable twin topotactic/nontopotactic Cu2+ accommodation mechanism is unprecedentedly established in an aqueous system. Nontopotactic conversion significantly improves the redox ability for superior ion storage, and the topotactic intercalated TiSe2 structure anchors the reduced titanium monomers with high affinity and promotes efficient charge transfer. The proposed mechanism synergistically enhances the capacity and reversibility of advanced rechargeable aqueous battery.








Abstract
Titanium selenide (TiSe2), a model transition metal chalcogenide material, typically relies on topotactic ion intercalation/deintercalation to achieve stable ion storage with minimal disruption of the transport pathways but has restricted capacity (&lt;130 mAh g&#8722;1). Developing novel energy storage mechanisms beyond conventional intercalation to break capacity limits in TiSe2 cathodes is essential yet challenging. Herein, the ion storage properties of TiSe2 are revisited and an unusual thermodynamically stable twin topotactic/nontopotactic Cu2+ accommodation mechanism for aqueous batteries is unraveled. In situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ microscopy jointly demonstrated that topotactic intercalation sustained the ion transport framework, nontopotactic conversion involved localized multielectron reactions, and these two parallel reactions are miraculously intertwined in nanoscale space. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical results suggested that the twin&#8208;reaction mechanism significantly improved the electron transfer ability, and the reserved intercalated TiSe2 structure anchored the reduced titanium monomers with high affinity and promoted efficient charge transfer to synergistically enhance the capacity and reversibility. Consequently, TiSe2 nanoflake cathodes delivered a never&#8208;before&#8208;achieved capacity of 275.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, 93.5% capacity retention over 1000 cycles, and endow hybrid batteries (TiSe2&#8208;Cu||Zn) with a stable energy supply of 181.34&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2339.81&#160;W kg&#8722;1, offering a promising model for aqueous ion storage.

         <title>A Functional Stent Encapsulating Radionuclide in Temperature&#8208;Memory Spiral Tubes for Malignant Stenosis of Esophageal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of esophageal cancer stent that can carry iodine&#8208;125 nuclide is designed. This stent has temperature&#8208;memory performance and uniform dose distribution. An animal model of esophageal cancer is constructed and its effectiveness is observed. After implantation, the stent can inhibit granulation proliferation and tumor growth, improving the progression of malignant stenosis.








Abstract
Stent implantation is a commonly used palliative treatment for alleviating stenosis in advanced esophageal cancer. However, tissue proliferation induced by stent implantation and continuous tumor growth can easily lead to restenosis. Therefore, functional stents are required to relieve stenosis while inhibiting tissue proliferation and tumor growth, thereby extending the patency. Currently, no ideal functional stents are available. Here, iodine&#8208;125 (125I) nuclides are encapsulated into a nickel&#8211;titanium alloy (NiTi) tube to develop a novel temperature&#8208;memory spiral radionuclide stent (TSRS). It has the characteristics of temperature&#8208;memory, no cold regions at the end of the stent, and a uniform spatial dose distribution. Cell&#8208;viability experiments reveal that the TSRS can reduce the proliferation of fibroblasts and tumor cells. TSRS implantation is feasible and safe, has no significant systemic radiotoxicity, and can inhibit in&#8208;stent and edge stenosis caused by stent&#8208;induced tissue proliferation in healthy rabbits. Moreover, TSRS can improve malignant stenosis and luminal patency resulting from continuous tumor growth in a VX2 esophageal cancer model. As a functional stent, the TSRS combines the excellent properties of NiTi with brachytherapy of the 125I nuclide and will make significant contributions to the treatment of malignant esophageal stenosis.

&lt;p&gt;A new type of esophageal cancer stent that can carry iodine-125 nuclide is designed. This stent has temperature-memory performance and uniform dose distribution. An animal model of esophageal cancer is constructed and its effectiveness is observed. After implantation, the stent can inhibit granulation proliferation and tumor growth, improving the progression of malignant stenosis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stent implantation is a commonly used palliative treatment for alleviating stenosis in advanced esophageal cancer. However, tissue proliferation induced by stent implantation and continuous tumor growth can easily lead to restenosis. Therefore, functional stents are required to relieve stenosis while inhibiting tissue proliferation and tumor growth, thereby extending the patency. Currently, no ideal functional stents are available. Here, iodine-125 (&lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I) nuclides are encapsulated into a nickel&#8211;titanium alloy (NiTi) tube to develop a novel temperature-memory spiral radionuclide stent (TSRS). It has the characteristics of temperature-memory, no cold regions at the end of the stent, and a uniform spatial dose distribution. Cell-viability experiments reveal that the TSRS can reduce the proliferation of fibroblasts and tumor cells. TSRS implantation is feasible and safe, has no significant systemic radiotoxicity, and can inhibit in-stent and edge stenosis caused by stent-induced tissue proliferation in healthy rabbits. Moreover, TSRS can improve malignant stenosis and luminal patency resulting from continuous tumor growth in a VX2 esophageal cancer model. As a functional stent, the TSRS combines the excellent properties of NiTi with brachytherapy of the &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I nuclide and will make significant contributions to the treatment of malignant esophageal stenosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated Coordination Polymer Enabling Ultralong Life Magnesium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated polymer (Mn&#8208;HHTP) is prepared assembled from the multidentate chelating groups of HHTP ligands and their isotropic coordination with Mn2+ ions. The unique 3D conjugated structure promotes the electron transfer and Mg2+ ion diffusion throughout the framework, and as a result, enables a ultralong cycle life of 4500 cycles as the cathode material of magnesium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
There has been increasing interests in &#960;&#8211;d conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs) for energy storage because of their rapid charge transfer through long&#8208;range planar &#960;&#8211;d conjugation between ligands and metal centers. Nevertheless, currently reported CCPs for energy storage are mostly based on 1D or 2D structures. There are few 3D CCPs reported to date because of the great challenge in constructing nonplanar coordination geometries, let alone their applications in multivalent ions storage. Herein, a triphenylene&#8208;catecholate&#8208;based 3D CCP (Mn&#8208;HHTP) is successfully synthesized assembled from the multidentate chelating groups of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) ligands and their isotropic coordination with Mn2+ ions. The 3D conjugated structure of Mn&#8208;HHTP enables an exceptional cycle life of &gt;4000 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 for multivalent Mg2+ ion storage, which is far superior to most organic and inorganic electrode materials. Experimental characterizations combined with theoretical calculations indicate that the semiquinone radicals at the HHTP ligands are the electroactive centers for Mg2+ ions storage. The excellent performance of Mn&#8208;HHTP opens a new avenue towards the design of 3D CCPs for long&#8208;life rechargeable magnesium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atoms on Crystalline Carbon Nitrides for Selective C&#9472;H Photooxidation: A Bridge to Achieve Homogeneous Pathways in Heterogeneous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost iron and manganese single&#8208;atoms are stabilized on poly(heptazine imides) (PHI). The resulting materials are exploited as photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of toluene into benzaldehyde, and further applied to the conversion of alkylaromatics and benzyl alcohols into the corresponding carbonyl derivatives. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy supports the intermediacy of metal&#8208;oxo species under heterogeneous conditions.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysis is a field of paramount importance in contemporary science due to its exceptional ability to combine the domains of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Iron and manganese metalloenzymes are known to be effective in C&#9472;H oxidation reactions in nature, inspiring scientists to mimic their active sites in artificial catalytic systems. Herein, a simple and versatile cation exchange method is successfully employed to stabilize low&#8208;cost iron and manganese single&#8208;atoms in poly(heptazine imides) (PHI). The resulting materials are employed as photocatalysts for toluene oxidation, demonstrating remarkable selectivity toward benzaldehyde. The protocol is then extended to the selective oxidation of different substrates, including (substituted) alkylaromatics, benzyl alcohols, and sulfides. Detailed mechanistic investigations revealed that iron&#8208; and manganese&#8208;containing photocatalysts work through a similar mechanism via the formation of high&#8208;valent M&#9552;O species. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is employed to confirm the formation of high&#8208;valent iron&#8208; and manganese&#8208;oxo species, typically found in metalloenzymes involved in highly selective C&#9472;H oxidations.

         <title>Self&#8208;Rolled&#8208;Up Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline Silicon Nanomembranes for On&#8208;Chip Tubular Polarization Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tubular microtubes of single&#8208;crystalline Si nanomembranes for photodetectors are prepared by a releasing and rolling process. The tubular geometry can trap light to improve the photoresponsivity of ultra&#8208;thin Si nanomembranes and demonstrate the advantage of wide&#8208;angle light coupling. Furthermore, the Si microtubes exhibit obvious polarization angle&#8208;dependent light absorption, enabling polarization&#8208;sensitive detection in the range of visible to near&#8208;infrared.








Abstract
Freestanding single&#8208;crystalline nanomembranes and their assembly have broad application potential in photodetectors for integrated chips. However, the release and self&#8208;assembly process of single&#8208;crystalline semiconductor nanomembranes still remains a great challenge in on&#8208;chip processing and functional integration, and photodetectors based on nanomembrane always suffer from limited absorption of nanoscale thickness. Here, a non&#8208;destructive releasing and rolling process is employed to prepare tubular photodetectors based on freestanding single&#8208;crystalline Si nanomembranes. Spontaneous release and self&#8208;assembly are achieved by residual strain introduced by lattice mismatch at the epitaxial interface of Si and Ge, and the intrinsic stress and strain distributions in self&#8208;rolled&#8208;up Si nanomembranes are analyzed experimentally and computationally. The advantages of light trapping and wide&#8208;angle optical coupling are realized by tubular geometry. This Si microtube device achieves reliable Ohmic contact and exhibits a photoresponsivity of over 330&#160;mA W&#8722;1, a response time of 370 &#181;s, and a light incident detection angle range of over 120&#176;. Furthermore, the microtubular structure shows a distinct polarization angle&#8208;dependent light absorption, with a dichroic ratio of 1.24 achieved at 940&#160;nm. The proposed Si&#8208;based microtubes provide new possibilities for the construction of multifunctional chips for integrated circuit ecosystems in the More than Moore era.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional MXene&#8208;Based Bioanode for Wearable Self&#8208;Charging Biosupercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional MXene&#8208;based bioanode is prepared with a 3D hierarchical structure for wearable self&#8208;charging biosupercapacitors. The device is designed in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure, and successfully realizes conformal and adhesion with human skin in a flexible environment. The skin&#8208;mountable device exhibits superior energy harvesting and storing performance from human sweat under both relaxed and stretching conditions.








Abstract
As a reliable energy&#8208;supply platform for wearable electronics, biosupercapacitors combine the characteristics of biofuel cells and supercapacitors to harvest and store the energy from human's sweat. However, the bulky preparation process and deep embedding of enzyme active sites in bioelectrodes usually limit the energy&#8208;harvesting process, retarding the practical power&#8208;supply sceneries especially during the complicated in vivo motion. Herein, a MXene/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube/lactate oxidase hierarchical structure as the dual&#8208;functional bioanode is designed, which can not only provide a superior 3D catalytic microenvironment for enzyme accommodation to harvest energy from sweat, but also offers sufficient capacitance to store energy via the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor. A wearable biosupercapacitor is fabricated in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure with a composite bioanode, active carbon/Pt cathode, polyacrylamide hydrogel substrate, and liquid metal conductor. The device exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;of 0.48&#160;V and the high power density of 220.9 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The compact conformal adhesion with skin is successfully maintained under stretching/bending conditions. After repeatedly stretching the devices, there is no significant power attenuation in pulsed output. The unique bioelectrode structure and attractive energy harvesting/storing properties demonstrate the promising potential of this biosupercapacitor as a micro self&#8208;powered platform of wearable electronics.

         <title>Polarization Reversal of Group IV&#8211;VI Semiconductors with Pucker&#8208;Like Structure: Mechanism Dissecting and Function Demonstration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The miniaturized image band identification and enhancement system can be achieved by utilizing a polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector with polarization reversal capability. The photodetector is constructed using in&#8208;plane pucker&#8208;like group IV&#8211;VI semiconductors MX (M&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn; X&#160;=&#160;S, Se), leveraging the intrinsic differences in transition probabilities of charge carriers.








Abstract
Polarization imaging presents advantages in capturing spatial, spectral, and polarization information across various spectral bands. It can improve the perceptual ability of image sensors and has garnered more applications. Despite its potential, challenges persist in identifying band information and implementing image enhancement using polarization imaging. These challenges often necessitate integrating spectrometers or other components, resulting in increased complexities within image processing systems and hindering device miniaturization trends. Here, the characteristics of anisotropic absorption reversal are systematically elucidated in pucker&#8208;like group IV&#8211;VI semiconductors MX (M&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn; X&#160;=&#160;S, Se) through theoretical predictions and experimental validations. Additionally, the fundamental mechanisms behind anisotropy reversal in different bands are also explored. The photodetector is constructed by utilizing MX as a light&#8208;absorbing layer, harnessing polarization&#8208;sensitive photoresponse for virtual imaging. The results indicate that the utilization of polarization reversal photodetectors holds advantages in achieving further multifunctional integration within the device structure while simplifying its configuration, including band information identification and image enhancement. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of polarization reversal mechanisms and presents a promising and reliable approach for achieving dual&#8208;band image band identification and image enhancement without additional auxiliary components.

         <title>Suppressing Bulk Strain and Surface O2 Release in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes by Just Tuning the Li Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coherent thin spinel&#8208;like structure is formed on the surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides by controlling the Li content during the synthesis. The combined in situ XRD and atomic&#8208;scale imaging of the structural evolution reveal that the surface layer simultaneously suppresses the bulk strain accumulation and surface O2 release, resulting in outstanding electrochemical performance and structural stability.








Abstract
Layered oxides represent a prominent class of cathodes employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The structural degradation of layered cathodes causes capacity decay during cycling, which is generally induced by anisotropic lattice strain in the bulk of cathode particle and oxygen release at the surface. However, particularly in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here a thin (1&#8208;nm) and coherent spinel&#8208;like phase is constructed on the surface of LLOs particle to suppress bulk strain and surface O2 release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel&#8208;like phase hinders the surface O2 release by accommodating O2 inside the surface layer, while the trapped O2 in the bulk impedes strain evolution by &#8776;70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability leads to an improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.5% after 100 cycles at 0.1&#176;C. These findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high&#8208;capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.

         <title>Manipulating Electron Redistribution in Ni2P for Enhanced Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv is successfully synthesized through manipulation of electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. Bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required high current densities at low voltages for overall seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH seawater. In Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv, P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity, and Ni sites are the dominant oxygen evolution reaction active centers; meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER, synergistically improve electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting remains a persistent challenge. Herein, an approach is proposed through density functional theory (DFT) preanalysis to manipulate electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. The needle&#8208;like Fe&#8208;doped Ni2P with P vacancy (Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv) is successfully synthesized on nickel foam, exhibiting a superior bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity for seawater electrolysis in alkaline condition. As a result, bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required current densities of 1.0 and 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 at low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73&#160;V, respectively, for seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH circumstances. The theoretical calculation and the experimental results collectively reveal the reasons for the enhancement of catalyst activity. Specifically, Fe doping and P vacancies can accelerate the reconstruction of OER active species and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) for HER. In addition, the active sites of Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. The study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel&#8208;based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.

An F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable during the long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. More than 6 times longer cycles compared with routine cells are achieved in 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type cells. The onset and triggering temperatures during the thermal runaway are increased from 70.8 and 117.4 to 100.6 and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
Severe dendrite growth and high&#8208;level activity of the lithium metal anode lead to a short life span and poor safety, seriously hindering the practical applications of lithium metal batteries. With a trisalt electrolyte design, an F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8211;rich solid electrolyte interphase on a lithium anode is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable over long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. As a result, its Coulombic efficiency can be maintained over&#160;98.98% for 400 cycles. An 85.0% capacity can be retained for coin&#8208;type full cells with a 3.14 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode after 200 cycles and 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type full cells with a 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode after 72 cycles. During the thermal runaway tests of a cycled 1.0 Ah pouch cell, the onset and triggering temperatures&#160;were increased from 70.8 &#176;C&#160;and 117.4 &#176;C&#160;to 100.6 &#176;C&#160;and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively, indicating a greatly enhanced safety performance. This work gives&#160;novel insights into electrolyte and interface design, potentially paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span, and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides, featuring quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;3D) Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels attained through the introduction of twin structures into the crystal framework, exhibit notably elevated Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficients, leading to impressive rate performance. Additionally, the twin structure serves as a protective barrier, impeding the migration of Mn ions and enhancing the overall structural stability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxides have gained significant attention worldwide as potential cathode materials for the next generation of high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nonetheless, the inferior rate capability and voltage decay issues present formidable challenges. Here, a Li&#8208;rich material equipped with quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;3D)&#160;Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels is initially synthesized by introducing twin structures with high Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficients into the crystal and constructing a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between different Li&#8208;ion diffusion tunnels. The as&#8208;prepared material exhibits monodispersed micron&#8208;sized primary particles (MP), delivering a specific capacity of 303&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 &#176;C and an impressive capacity of 253&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1 &#176;C. More importantly, the twin structure also serves as a &#8220;breakwater&#8221; to inhibit the migration of Mn ions and improve the overall structural stability, leading to cycling stability with 85% capacity retention at 1 &#176;C&#160;after 200 cycles. The proposed strategy of constructing quasi&#8208;3D&#160;channels in the layered Li&#8208;rich cathodes will open up new avenues for the research and development of other layered oxide cathodes, with potential applications in industry.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect healing treatment is reported to rejuvenate the aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which could effectively heal the surface matrix defects and revive the morphology of aged PQDs, substantially improving the optoelectronic properties and orientation of PQD solids. Consequently, solar cells fabricated using rejuvenated PQDs show comparable photovoltaic performance with the control solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solar cells owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, the optoelectronic properties of PQDs suffer from severe degradation in storage due to the dynamically binding ligands, predominantly affecting photovoltaic applications. Herein, an in situ defect healing treatment (DHT) is reported to effectively rejuvenate aged PQDs. Systematically, experimental studies and theoretical calculations are performed to fundamentally understand the causes leading to the recovered optoelectronic properties of aged PQDs. The results reveal that the I3&#8722; anions produced from tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylammonium iodide and iodine could strongly anchor on the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs, substantially diminishing the nonradiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, an DHT could also renovate the morphology of aged PQDs and thus improve the stacking orientation of PQD solids, substantially ameliorating charge carrier transport within PQD solids. Consequently, by using a DHT, the PQD solar cell (PQDSC) yields a high efficiency of up to 15.88%, which is comparable with the PQDSCs fabricated using fresh PQDs. Meanwhile, the stability of PQDSCs fabricated using the rejuvenated PQDs is also largely improved.

         <title>Oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kagome (kgm)&#160;topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are rationally designed for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. COF&#8208;954 shows high and stable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance in water, 3% NaCl solution, and seawater. The water&#8208;drainage experiments also suggest the potential of COF&#8208;954 in the practical applications for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great advantages as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two Kagome (kgm) topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based COFs are designed and synthesized for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF&#8208;954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibits high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF&#8208;954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8211;vis) light irradiation. Additionally, the water&#8208;drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25 and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 min under UV&#8211;vis light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrates an effective design strategy toward highly efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>A Universal Cross&#8208;Synthetic Strategy for Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Metal&#8208;Based Composites with Excellent Ion Storage Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By crossing the salt template with the powder metallurgy technology, sub&#8208;10&#160;nm metal&#8208;based nanomaterials embedded in free&#8208;standing carbon foam (SMN/FC&#8208;F) electrodes are universally prepared. Their unique structural advantages enable them to have excellent reversible ion storage reaction kinetics and long&#8208;term cycling performance for full cells.








Abstract
The sub&#8208;10&#160;nm metal&#8208;based nanomaterials (SMNs) show great potential for the electrochemical energy storage field. However, their ion storage capacity and stability suffer from severe agglomeration and interface problems. Herein, a universal strategy is reported to synthesize a wide range of SMNs (e.g., metal, nitride, oxide, and sulfides) embedded in free&#8208;standing carbon foam (SMN/FC&#8208;F) composite electrodes by crossing the interfacial confinement of NaCl self&#8208;assembly with the thermal&#8208;mechanical coupling of powder metallurgy. The pressure&#8208;enhanced NaCl self&#8208;assembly interfacial confinement is greatly beneficial to preventing SMN agglomeration and promoting SMNs embedded in FC&#8208;F which originate from the welding of carbon nanosheets. They are confirmed via a series of advanced characterizations including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, with theoretical computations. Benefiting from the unique structure, SMNs/FC&#8208;F delivers ultrafast and stable ion&#8208;storage kinetics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the MoS2/FC&#8208;F shows excellent ion storage kinetics and superior long&#8208;term cycling performance for ion storage (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)2O2F/C//MoS2/FC&#8208;F sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit a high reversible capacity of 185&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle.).

         <title>Enhancing the Uniformity of Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by a Single&#8208;Crystalline Layer&#8208;Controlled Active Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to enhance the uniformity of organic field&#8208;effect transistors in electrical performance by utilizing single&#8208;crystalline layer&#8208;controlled active channels is reported. While maintaining a high average mobility over 10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, a coefficient of variance in mobility of only 2.57% is achieved. The high and uniform performance under statistical studies is critical in developing organic field&#8208;effect transistor&#8208;based circuits.








Abstract
Despite remarkable improvement in the mobility of the organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) being achieved in past decades, the uniformity in electrical performance remains ambiguous, impeding their implantation in organic integrated circuits. The coefficient of variance (CV) in mobility of reported OFETs is typically larger than 8%, which is not adequate for building medium&#8208;to&#8208;large scale integrated circuits. In this work, it is shown that utilizing single&#8208;domain molecular monolayer crystals as the active channel can largely enhance the uniformity of OFETs. Benefiting from the sole molecular layer with long&#8208;range ordering, the OFETs exhibit uniformities in both channel transport and charge injection, thereby giving rise to a high average mobility of 11.64 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and CV of only 2.57%. Statistical transmission length method evaluation is conducted, covering channel length from 3 to 21&#160;&#181;m, channel width from 90 to 170&#160;&#181;m, and a total OFET number of 370. The low contact resistance of 79.00 &#177; 7.00 &#937; cm and high intrinsic mobility of 12.36 &#177; 0.45 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are acquired with very high accuracy and reliability.

     alt="Enhancing the Uniformity of Organic Field-Effect Transistors by a Single-Crystalline Layer-Controlled Active Channel"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy to enhance the uniformity of organic field-effect transistors in electrical performance by utilizing single-crystalline layer-controlled active channels is reported. While maintaining a high average mobility over 10 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a coefficient of variance in mobility of only 2.57% is achieved. The high and uniform performance under statistical studies is critical in developing organic field-effect transistor-based circuits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite remarkable improvement in the mobility of the organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) being achieved in past decades, the uniformity in electrical performance remains ambiguous, impeding their implantation in organic integrated circuits. The coefficient of variance (CV) in mobility of reported OFETs is typically larger than 8%, which is not adequate for building medium-to-large scale integrated circuits. In this work, it is shown that utilizing single-domain molecular monolayer crystals as the active channel can largely enhance the uniformity of OFETs. Benefiting from the sole molecular layer with long-range ordering, the OFETs exhibit uniformities in both channel transport and charge injection, thereby giving rise to a high average mobility of 11.64 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and CV of only 2.57%. Statistical transmission length method evaluation is conducted, covering channel length from 3 to 21&#160;&#181;m, channel width from 90 to 170&#160;&#181;m, and a total OFET number of 370. The low contact resistance of 79.00 &#177; 7.00 &#937; cm and high intrinsic mobility of 12.36 &#177; 0.45 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are acquired with very high accuracy and reliability. As such, this work provides a practical way to enhance the uniformity of OFETs by a single-crystalline layer-controlled active channel toward their applications in integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing Co&#8208;N4@Co&#8208;NP Bridge&#8208;Enabled Fast Charge Transfer and Active Intracellular Methanogenesis in Bio&#8208;Electrochemical CO2&#8208;Conversion with Methanosarcina Barkeri</title>

         <dc:description>
Enhanced extracellular electron transfer and intracellular methanogenesis are revealed with the biohybrid consisting of a Co&#8208;N4@Co&#8208;NP bridge&#8208;based nanosheet electrode and a model methanogen of Methanosarcina barkeri, leading to an extremely high CH4 production rate of 3860&#160;mmol&#160;m&#8722;2 day&#8722;1 (&#8722;1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl).








Abstract
To significantly advance the bio&#8208;electrochemical CO2&#8208;conversion rate and unfold the correlation between the abiotic electrode and the attached microorganisms, an atomic&#8208;nanoparticle bridge of Co&#8208;N4@Co&#8208;NP crafted in metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8208;derived nanosheets is integrated with a model methanogen of Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri). The direct bonding of N in Co&#8208;N4 and Fe in member protein of Cytochrome b (Cytb) activates a fast direct electron transfer path while the Co nanoparticles further strengthen this bonding via decreasing the energy gap between the p&#8208;band center of N and the d&#8208;band center of Fe. This multiorbital tuning operation of Co nanoparticles also enhances the coenzyme F420&#8208;mediated electron transfer by enabling the electron flow direct to the hydrogenation sites. Particularly, the increased surface electric field of the Co&#8208;N4@Co&#8208;NP bridge&#8208;based nanosheet electrode facilitates the interfacial Na+ accumulation to expedite ATPase transport for powering intracellular CO2 conversion. Remarkably, the self&#8208;assembled M.barkeri&#8208;Co&#8208;N4@Co&#8208;NP biohybrid achieves a high methane production rate of 3860&#160;mmol m&#8722;2 day&#8722;1, which greatly outperforms other reported biohybrid systems. This work demonstrates a comprehensive scrutinization of biotic&#8211;abiotic energy transfer, which may serve as a guiding principle for efficient bio&#8208;electrochemical system design.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Display Based on MoS2 Backplane Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The uniform deposition of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) and their integration with backplane thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) remain challenging for large&#8208;area display applications. Herein, an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display fabricated via the heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) LEDs and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#8208;based TFTs is presented. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of highly uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. PeLEDs are integrated with MoS2 TFTs to fabricate an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display with an 8 &#215; 8 array, which exhibits excellent brightness control capability and high switching speeds. This study demonstrates the potential of PeLEDs as candidates for next generation displays and presents a novel approach for fabricating optoelectronic devices via the heterogeneous integration of 2D materials and perovskites, thereby paving the way toward the fabrication of practical future optoelectronic systems.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;integrated Force Sensor using 3D Printed Spring&#8208;Composed Fabry&#8208;Perot Cavities with a High Precision Down to Tens of Piconewton</title>

Abstract
Developing microscale sensors capable of force measurements down to the scale of piconewtons is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications. To date, advanced instrumentations such as atomic force microscopes and other specifically developed micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems face challenges such as high cost, complex detection systems and poor electromagnetic compatibility. Here, we&#160;present the unprecedented design and 3D printing of general fiber&#8208;integrated force sensors using spring&#8208;composed Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities. We&#160;calibrate these microscale devices employing varied&#8208;diameter &#956; m&#8208;scale silica particles as standard weights. The force sensitivity and resolution reach values of (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nm/nN and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, which are the best resolutions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes so far. We&#160;also measured the non&#8208;linear airflow force distributions produced from a nozzle with an orifice of 2 &#956; m which matches well with the full&#8208;sized simulations. With further customization of their geometries and materials, we&#160;anticipate the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe can well extend to many other applications such as air/fluidic turbulences sensing, micro&#8208;manipulations, and biological&#160;sensing.

         <title>Recycled Tandem Catalysts Promising Ultra&#8208;low Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO2 redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER) kinetics with an in&#8208;built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface&#8208;induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO2RR and CO2ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics&#8208;derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultra&#8208;low voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultra&#8208;high energy efficiency of 92.4%. Profoundly, this work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts from recycled spent electronics and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation including but not limited to BEF to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>A Cardiac&#8208;Targeted Nanozyme Interrupts the Inflammation&#8208;Free Radical Cycle in Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Severe systemic inflammation following myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of patient mortality. MI&#8208;induced inflammation can trigger the production of free radicals, which in turn ultimately leads to increased inflammation in cardiac lesions (i.e., inflammation&#8208;free radicals cycle), resulting in heart failure and patient death. However, currently available anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs have limited efficacy due to their weak anti&#8208;inflammatory effect and poor accumulation at the cardiac site. Herein, we developed a novel Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme for targeted therapy of MI, which was generated by coordinating Fe3+ and anti&#8208;inflammatory drug curcumin (Cur) with further modification of tannic acid (TA). Such Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme exhibited excellent free radicals scavenging and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties by reducing immune cell infiltration, promoting macrophage polarization toward the M2&#8208;like phenotype, suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion, and blocking the inflammatory free radicals cycle. Furthermore, due to the high affinity of TA for cardiac tissue, Fe&#8208;Cur@TA showed an almost 10&#8208;fold greater in cardiac retention and uptake than Fe&#8208;Cur. In mouse and preclinical beagle dog MI models, Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme preserved cardiac function and reduced scar size, suggesting promising potential for clinical translation in cardiovascular disease.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe systemic inflammation following myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of patient mortality. MI-induced inflammation can trigger the production of free radicals, which in turn ultimately leads to increased inflammation in cardiac lesions (i.e., inflammation-free radicals cycle), resulting in heart failure and patient death. However, currently available anti-inflammatory drugs have limited efficacy due to their weak anti-inflammatory effect and poor accumulation at the cardiac site. Herein, we developed a novel Fe-Cur@TA nanozyme for targeted therapy of MI, which was generated by coordinating Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and anti-inflammatory drug curcumin (Cur) with further modification of tannic acid (TA). Such Fe-Cur@TA nanozyme exhibited excellent free radicals scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties by reducing immune cell infiltration, promoting macrophage polarization toward the M2-like phenotype, suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion, and blocking the inflammatory free radicals cycle. Furthermore, due to the high affinity of TA for cardiac tissue, Fe-Cur@TA showed an almost 10-fold greater in cardiac retention and uptake than Fe-Cur. In mouse and preclinical beagle dog MI models, Fe-Cur@TA nanozyme preserved cardiac function and reduced scar size, suggesting promising potential for clinical translation in cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>D Insertion Chains Induced Small&#8208;Polaron Collapse in MoS2 2d Layers Toward Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with high theoretical capacity has been viewed as a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, but suffers from inferior rate capability owing to the polaron&#8208;induced slow charge transfer. Herein, we proposed a polaron collapse strategy induced by electron&#8208;rich insertions to effectively solve the above issue. Specifically, 1D [MoS] chains are inserted into MoS2 to break the symmetry states of 2D layers and induce small&#8208;polaron collapse to gain fast charge transfer, so that the as&#8208;obtained thermodynamically stable Mo2S3 shows metallic behavior with 107 times larger electrical conductivity than that of MoS2. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Mo2S3 owns highly delocalized anions, which substantially reduces the interactions of Na&#8722;S to efficiently accelerate Na+ diffusion, endowing Mo2S3 lower energy barrier (0.38&#160;versus 0.65&#160;eV of MoS2). The novel Mo2S3 anode exhibits a high capacity of 510 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C and a superior high&#8208;rate stability of 217 mAh g&#8722;1 at 40 C over 15000 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the in&#8208;depth reversible redox chemistry in Mo2S3. The proposed polaron collapse strategy for intrinsically facilitating charge transfer could be conducive to electrode design for fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>Breadmaking&#8208;inspired Antioxidant Porous Yeast Microcarriers for Stem Cell Delivery in Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;based therapies have exhibited significant promise in the treatment of diabetic ulcers (DU). Nevertheless, enhancing the survival rate and functionality of transplanted stem cells poses a substantial challenge. In this study, inspired by the breadmaking process, we have devised yeast microcarriers (YMC) as vehicles for stem cells to address these challenges. The fabrication of YMC involved the amalgamation of microfluidic emulsification with yeast&#8208;mediated fermentation, yielding microcarriers with outstanding biocompatibility, high porosity, and antioxidant activity. Adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) seeded onto YMC displayed remarkable cell viability and retained their cellular functions effectively. Additionally, YMC boasted a rich glutathione (GSH) content and exhibited remarkable ROS scavenging ability, thus shielding the ADSCs from oxidative stress. In vivo experiments further substantiated that ADSC@YMC implementation significantly lowered ROS levels in diabetic wounds, resulting in enhanced stem cell retention and improved angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and tissue regeneration. These results highlighted the potential of ADSC@YMC as a promising platform for delivering stem cell in the treatment of diabetic wounds.

         <title>Photodynamic Modulation of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Mitochondria Network Boosted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents a promising approach for enhancing tumor therapy efficacy by inducing antitumor immune response. However, current ICD inducers often have insufficient ER enrichment and ineffectiveness in tumor immune escape caused by ER&#8208;mitochondria interaction. In this study, we develop a kind of photoactivatable probe, THTTPy&#8208;PTSA, which enables sequential targeting of the ER and mitochondria. THTTPy&#8208;PTSA incorporates p&#8208;Toluenesulfonamide (PTSA) for ER targeting, and upon light irradiation, the tetrahydropyridine group undergoes a photo oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, transforming into a pyridinium group that acts as a mitochondria&#8208;targeting moiety. Our results demonstrate that THTTPy&#8208;PTSA exhibits exceptional subcellular translocation from the ER to mitochondria upon light irradiation treatment, subsequently triggers a stronger ER stress response through a cascade&#8208;amplification effect. Importantly, the augmented ER stress leads to substantial therapeutic efficacy in a 4T1 tumor model by eliciting the release of numerous damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), thereby inducing evident and widespread ICD, consequently enhancing the anti&#8208;tumor immune efficacy. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal role of photodynamic modulation of the ER&#8208;mitochondria network, facilitated by THTTPy&#8208;PTSA with precise spatial and temporal regulation, in effectively bolstering the antitumor immune response. This innovative approach presents a promising alternative for addressing the challenges associated with cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Direct 3D&#8208;Bioprinting of hiPSC&#8208;Derived Cardiomyocytes to Generate Functional Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;bioprinting is a promising technology to generate cardiac tissues as models or for organ repair. However, printing functional tissues in a direct manner has proven difficult. In this work, cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, in a collagen/hyaluronic acid bioink, are printed to generate ring&#8208;shaped tissues or model ventricles. Tissues display spontaneous contractions for up to 100&#8208;days and responsivity to pharmacological stimulation.








Abstract
3D&#8208;bioprinting is a promising technology to produce human tissues as drug screening tool or for organ repair. However, direct printing of living cells has proven difficult. Here, a method is presented to directly 3D&#8208;bioprint human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes embedded in a collagen&#8211;hyaluronic acid ink, generating centimeter&#8208;sized functional ring&#8208; and ventricle&#8208;shaped cardiac tissues in an accurate and reproducible manner. The printed tissues contain hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes with well&#8208;organized sarcomeres and exhibit spontaneous and regular contractions, which persist for several months and&#160;are able to contract against passive resistance. Importantly, beating frequencies of the printed cardiac tissues can be modulated by pharmacological stimulation. This approach opens up new possibilities for generating complex functional cardiac tissues as models for advanced drug screening or as tissue grafts for organ repair or replacement.

         <title>Unlocking the Ambient Temperature Effect on FA&#8208;Based Perovskites Crystallization by In Situ Optical Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nondestructive in situ dynamic photoluminescence probing technique is used to investigate the fast nucleation, crystallization, and grains aggregation processes during the mixed cation perovskites formation. This work reveals the limiting factors for achieving high&#8208;quality FA&#8208;based perovskite films and helps to unlock the existing narrow processing window for future large&#8208;scale production.








Abstract
Multiple cation&#8208;composited perovskites are demonstrated as a promising approach to improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, recipes developed for fabricating high&#8208;performance perovskites in laboratories are always not transferable in large&#8208;scale production, as perovskite crystallization is highly sensitive to processing conditions. Here, using an in situ optical method, the ambient temperature effect on the crystallization process in multiple cation&#8208;composited perovskites is investigated. It is found that the typical solvent&#8208;coordinated intermediate phase in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) is absent in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), and nucleation is almost completed in FAPbI3 right after spin&#8208;coating. Interestingly, it is found that there is noticeable nuclei aggregation in Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based perovskites even during the spin&#8208;coating process, which is usually only observed during the annealing in MAPbI3. Such aggregation is further promoted at a higher ambient temperature or in higher FA content. Instead of the general belief of stress release&#8208;induced crack formation, it is proposed that the origin of the cracks in FA&#8208;based perovskites is due to the aggregation&#8208;induced solute depletion effect. This work reveals the limiting factors for achieving high&#8208;quality FA&#8208;based perovskite films and helps to unlock the existing narrow processing window for future large&#8208;scale production.

It is found that the typical solvent-coordinated intermediate phase in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is absent in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and nucleation is almost completed in FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; right after spin-coating. Interestingly, it is found that there is noticeable nuclei aggregation in Formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites even during the spin-coating process, which is usually only observed during the annealing in MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Such aggregation is further promoted at a higher ambient temperature or in higher FA content. Instead of the general belief of stress release-induced crack formation, it is proposed that the origin of the cracks in FA-based perovskites is due to the aggregation-induced solute depletion effect. This work reveals the limiting factors for achieving high-quality FA-based perovskite films and helps to unlock the existing narrow processing window for future large-scale production.

         <title>Review on Fatigue of Additive Manufactured Metallic Alloys: Microstructure, Performance, Enhancement, and Assessment Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive manufactured metals have excellent mechanical properties, but their fatigue resistance is an exception. This article reviews the processes attributes, hierarchical microstructure, fatigue performance, and evaluation methods. The fatigue failure mechanisms of printed metals were&#160;summarized, and the competition between trans&#8208;scale microstructures and defects was&#160;revealed. Anti&#8208;fatigue strategies are summarized according to the categories of pre&#8208;process, inter&#8208;process, and post&#8208;process.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM), which is a process of building objects in a layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer fashion from designed models, has received unprecedented attention from research and industry because it offers outstanding merits of flexibility, customization, reduced buy&#8208;to&#8208;fly ratio, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the fatigue performance of safety&#8208;critical industrial components fabricated by AM is still far below that obtained from conventional methods. This review discusses the microstructural heterogeneities, randomly dispersed defects, poor surface quality, and complex residual stress generated during the AM process that can negatively impact the fatigue performance of as&#8208;printed parts. The difference in microstructural origin of fatigue failure between conventionally manufactured and printed metals is reviewed with particular attention to the effects of the trans&#8208;scale microstructures on AM fatigue failure mechanisms. Various methods for mitigating the fatigue issue, including pre&#8208;process, inter&#8208;process, and post&#8208;process treatments, are illustrated. Empirical, semi&#8208;empirical, and microstructure&#8208;sensitive models are presented to predict fatigue strength and lifetime. Summary and outlooks for future development of the fatigue performance of AM materials are provided.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Induced Lattice Strain for High&#8208;Performance Organic Transistors with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;induced lattice strain (OILS) strategy is developed to achieve organic semiconductors (OSCs) with both high mobility and high stability. The introduction of oxygen (O2) into OSC crystals will generate lattice compressive strain that increases the orbital overlap between adjacent molecules. Consequently, organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on OILS OSCs show high mobility and high stability with a record saturated power density 3.4&#160;&#215;&#160;104 W&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Integrating the merits of low cost, flexibility, and large&#8208;area processing, organic semiconductors (OSCs) are promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation electronic materials.&#160;The mobility and stability are the key figures of merit for its practical application. However, it is greatly challenging to improve the mobility and stability simultaneously owing to the weak interactions and poor electronic coupling between OSCs molecules. Here, an oxygen&#8208;induced lattice strain (OILS) strategy is developed to achieve OSCs with both high mobility and high stability. Utilizing the strategy, the maximum mobility of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT) organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) rises to 15.3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and the contact resistance lowers to 25.5&#160;&#937;&#160;cm. Remarkably, the thermal stability of DNTT is much improved, and a record saturated power density of &#8776;3.4&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 is obtained. Both the experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the lattice compressive strain induced by oxygen is responsible for their high performance and stability. Furthermore, the universality of the strategy is manifested in both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type small OSCs. This work provides a novel strategy to improve both the mobility and the stability of OSCs, paving the way for the practical applications of organic devices.

         <title>Micro&#8208;/Nanohierarchical Structures Physically Engineered on Surfaces: Analysis and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent decades, significant progress has been achieved in micro&#8208;/nanohierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of such structures, provides a classification of their basic constituents according to function and shape, and discusses the related fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions.








Abstract
The high demand for micro&#8208;/nanohierarchical structures as components of functional substrates, bioinspired devices, energy&#8208;related electronics, and chemical/physical transducers has inspired their in&#8208;depth studies and active development of the related fabrication techniques. In particular, significant progress has been achieved in hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces, which offer the advantages of wide&#8208;range material compatibility, design diversity, and mechanical stability, and numerous unique structures with important niche applications have been developed. This review categorizes the basic components of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces according to function/shape and comprehensively summarizes the related advances, focusing on the fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces are compared based on the function of their basic components, which may help to avoid the bottlenecks of conventional single&#8208;scale functional substrates. Thus, the present work is expected to provide a useful reference for scientists working on multicomponent functional substrates and inspire further research in this field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress with regard to MXene&#8208;based current collectors for rechargeable batteries is systematically reviewed. The application of MXene in the current collector has achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. Up to now, various effective strategies have been presented and achieved positive effects, such as vacuum filtration, freeze&#8208;drying and in situ electrodeposition, etc.








Abstract
As an indispensable component of rechargeable batteries, the current collector plays a crucial role in supporting the electrode materials and collecting the accumulated electrical energy. However, some key issues, like uneven resources, high weight percentage, electrolytic&#160;corrosion, and high&#8208;voltage instability, cannot meet the growing need for rechargeable batteries. In recent years, MXene&#8208;based current collectors have achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. The related research has increased significantly. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review of this area is seldom. Herein the applications and progress of MXene in current collector are systematically summarized and discussed. Meanwhile, some challenges and future directions are presented.

         <title>Wearable and Implantable Cortisol&#8208;Sensing Electronics for Stress Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable and implantable device can be placed on the body to continuously monitor the status of the subject. Cortisol, a hormone released in response to stress, varies in concentration among individuals and its fluctuations are not consistent. In this review, recent research that utilizes continuous measurements to analyze the dynamic stress response is examined.








Abstract
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released from the body in response to stress. Although a moderate level of cortisol secretion can help the body maintain homeostasis, excessive secretion can cause various diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Conventional methods for cortisol measurement undergo procedures that limit continuous monitoring, typically collecting samples of bodily fluids, followed by separate analysis in a laboratory setting that takes several hours. Thus, recent studies demonstrate wearable, miniaturized sensors integrated with electronic modules that enable wireless real&#8208;time analysis. Here, the primary focus is on wearable and implantable electronic devices that continuously measure cortisol concentration. Diverse types of cortisol&#8208;sensing techniques, such as antibody&#8208;, DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;, and molecularly imprinted polymer&#8208;based sensors, as well as wearable and implantable devices that aim to continuously monitor cortisol in a minimally invasive fashion are discussed. In addition to the cortisol monitors that directly measure stress levels, other schemes that indirectly measure stress, such as electrophysiological signals and sweat are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in stress monitoring and management electronics are reviewed.

Thus, recent studies demonstrate wearable, miniaturized sensors integrated with electronic modules that enable wireless real-time analysis. Here, the primary focus is on wearable and implantable electronic devices that continuously measure cortisol concentration. Diverse types of cortisol-sensing techniques, such as antibody-, DNA-aptamer-, and molecularly imprinted polymer-based sensors, as well as wearable and implantable devices that aim to continuously monitor cortisol in a minimally invasive fashion are discussed. In addition to the cortisol monitors that directly measure stress levels, other schemes that indirectly measure stress, such as electrophysiological signals and sweat are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in stress monitoring and management electronics are reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coplanar conformational segment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer is a unique structure with a rigid backbone, long effective conjugated length, and narrow bandgap, which may enhance emission behavior, strengthen &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and improve charge transport. This overview mainly reports the recent development of coplanar conformational structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. The characteristics, analysis methods, preparation, and their optoelectronic application are introduced and summarized systematically.








Abstract
Hierarchical structure of conjugated polymers is critical to dominating their optoelectronic properties and applications. Compared to nonplanar conformational segments, coplanar conformational segments of conjugated polymers (CPs) demonstrate favorable properties for applications as a semiconductor. Herein, recent developments in the coplanar conformational structure of CPs for optoelectronic devices are summarized. First, this review comprehensively summarizes the unique properties of planar conformational structures. Second, the characteristics of the coplanar conformation in terms of optoelectrical properties and other polymer physics characteristics are emphasized. Five primary characterization methods for investigating the complanate backbone structures are illustrated, providing a systematical toolbox for studying this specific conformation. Third, internal and external conditions for inducing the coplanar conformational structure are presented, offering guidelines for designing this conformation. Fourth, the optoelectronic applications of this segment, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are briefly summarized. Finally, a conclusion and outlook for the coplanar conformational segment regarding molecular design and applications are provided.

         <title>Advanced Catalyst Design and Reactor Configuration Upgrade in Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced electrocatalysts and reactors are two important parallels in practical electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR). This review systematically presents the recent progress of electrocatalytic CO2RR, covering fundamental insights into a mechanism, innovative electrocatalyst design strategies based on catalyst&#8208;intermediate interaction, and the reactor optimization is also summarized to pursue high&#8208;throughput electrochemical carbon neutralization.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) driven by renewable energy shows great promise in mitigating and potentially reversing the devastating effects of anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation. The simultaneous synthesis of energy&#8208;dense chemicals can meet global energy demand while decoupling emissions from economic growth. However, the development of CO2RR technology faces challenges in catalyst discovery and device optimization that hinder their industrial implementation. In this contribution, a comprehensive overview of the current state of CO2RR research is provided, starting with the background and motivation for this technology, followed by the fundamentals and evaluated metrics. Then the underlying design principles of electrocatalysts are discussed, emphasizing their structure&#8211;performance correlations and advanced electrochemical assembly cells that can increase CO2RR selectivity and throughput. Finally, the review looks to the future and identifies opportunities for innovation in mechanism discovery, material screening strategies, and device assemblies to move toward a carbon&#8208;neutral society.

         <title>Regulating Phase Separation Kinetics for High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a random terpolymer PBDB&#8208;TFCl and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation and reinforced molecular packing are obtained. Resulting flexible organic solar modules exhibit maximum power conversion efficiency of 12.7% and excellent mechanical properties and photostability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) possess excellent operation stability and mechanical robustness than other types of organic solar cells, thereby attracting considerable attention for wearable flexible electron devices. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;PSCs are still lagging behind those of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based systems owing to the limitation of photoactive materials and unsatisfactory blend morphology. In this work, a novel terpolymer, denoted as PBDB&#8208;TFCl (poly4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;4&#8208;fluorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;5,7&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H,8H&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione&#8208;4,8&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene), is used as an electron donor coupled with a ternary strategy to optimize the performance of all&#8208;PSCs. The addition of PBDB&#8208;TCl unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, reducing voltage losses. Moreover, the introduction of the guest donor (D18&#8208;Cl) effectively regulates the phase&#8208;transition kinetics of PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT during the film formation, leading to ideal size of aggregations and enhanced crystallinity. PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT devices exhibit a PCE of 18.6% (certified as 18.3%), judged as the highest value so far obtained with all&#8208;PSCs. Besides, based on the ternary active layer, the manufactured 36 cm2 flexible modules exhibit a PCE of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs exhibit superior photostability and mechanical stability. In summary, the proposed strategy, based on molecular design and the ternary strategy, allows optimization of the all&#8208;polymer blend morphology and improvement of the photovoltaic performance for stable large&#8208;scale flexible PSCs.

         <title>Inorganic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries: Electrolyte Designing and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes various inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (such as oxide&#8208;based, NASICON&#8208;type, sulfide&#8208;based, etc.) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. Their crystal structures, and modification strategies to enhance ionic conductivity are discussed. Additionally, methods for modifying the interfaces between solid electrolytes and cathodes/anodes, and optimizing full battery performance are explored. Lastly, the future development directions of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (IASSSBs) are emerged as promising candidates to replace commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their potential advantages, such as abundant raw materials, robust safety, low price, high&#8208;energy density, favorable reliability and stability. Inorganic sodium solid electrolytes (ISSEs) are an indispensable component of IASSSBs, gaining significant attention. Herein, this review begins by discussing the fundamentals of ISSEs, including their ionic conductivity, mechanical property, chemical and electrochemical stabilities. It then presents the crystal structures of advanced ISSEs (e.g., &#946;/&#946;''&#8208;alumina, NASICON, sulfides, complex hydride and halide electrolytes) and the related issues, along with corresponding modification strategies. The review also outlines effective approaches for forming intimate interfaces between ISSEs and working electrodes. Finally, current challenges and critical perspectives for the potential developments and possible directions to improve interfacial contacts for future practical applications of ISSEs are highlighted. This comprehensive review aims to advance the understanding and development of next&#8208;generation rechargeable IASSSBs.

Abstract
Fast production of hydrogen and oxygen in large amounts at an economic rate is the need of the hour to cater to the needs of the most awaited hydrogen energy, a futuristic renewable energy solution. Production of hydrogen through simple water splitting via visible light photocatalytic approach using sunlight is considered as one of the most promising and sustainable approaches for generating clean fuels. For this purpose, a variety of catalytic techniques and novel catalysts have been investigated. Among these catalysts, carbon nitride is presently deemed as one of the best candidates for the visible light photocatalysis due to its unique molecular structure and adequate visible&#8208;range bandgap. Its bandgap can be further engineered by structural and morphological manipulation or by doping/hybridization. Among numerous synthetic approaches for carbon nitrides, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is one of the recently developed elegant bottom&#8208;up strategies as it is bio&#8208;inspired and provides a facile and eco&#8208;friendly route to synthesize high surface area carbon nitride with superior morphological features and other semiconducting and catalytic properties. The current review article broadly covers supramolecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of carbon nitride nanostructures and their photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting applications and provides a comprehensive outlook on future directions.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Subwavelength Perovskite Lasing from Transparent Silica&#8208;Based Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a ligand&#8208;assisted thermally co&#8208;evaporation strategy, an extraordinary&#8208;performance subwavelength&#8208;scale water&#8208;resistant perovskite laser with all&#8208;transparent SiO2 plates is demonstrated. Owing to the defect passivation and spatial confinement, the suppressed trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination and enhanced radiative recombination are acquired, thereby significantly improving the gain properties. Especially, the laser could hold a robust single&#8208;mode behavior in water for 20 days.








Abstract
Great research efforts are devoted to exploring the miniaturization of chip&#8208;scale coherent light sources possessing excellent lasing performance. Despite the indispensable&#160;role in Si photonics, SiO2 is generally considered not contributing to the starting up and operation of integrated lasers. Here, this work demonstrates an extraordinary&#8208;performance subwavelength&#8208;scale perovskite vertical cavity laser with all&#8208;transparent SiO2 cavity, whose cavity is ultra&#8208;simple and composed of only two parallel SiO2 plates. By introducing a ligand&#8208;assisted thermally co&#8208;evaporation strategy, highly luminescent perovskite film with high reproducibility and excellent optical gain is grown directly on SiO2. Benefitting from their high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index contrast, low&#8208;threshold, high&#8208;quality factor, and single&#8208;mode lasing is achieved in subwavelength range of &#8776;120&#160;nm, and verified by long&#8208;range coherence distance (115.6&#160;&#181;m) and high linear polarization degree (82%). More importantly, the subwavelength perovskite laser device could operate in water for 20 days without any observable degradation, exhibiting ultra&#8208;stable water&#8208;resistant performance. These findings would provide a simple but robust and reliable strategy for the miniaturized on&#8208;chip lasers compatible with Si photonics.

         <title>Force&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Destructive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Force&#8208;triggered self&#8208;destructive hydrogels are developed by using mechano&#8208;responsive DNA hairpins &#160;that crosslink the gel network. The DNA is protected by folding under static conditions, but under force, cryptic sites are exposed, which allows Cas12a nuclease to destroy the phosphodiester DNA backbone. In this work, tunable force sensitivity is demonstrated to trigger self&#8208;destruction and cargo release from the hydrogel.








Abstract
Self&#8208;destructive polymers (SDPs) are defined as a class of smart polymers that autonomously degrade upon experiencing an external trigger, such as a chemical cue or optical excitation. Because SDPs release the materials trapped inside the network upon degradation, they have potential applications in drug delivery and analytical sensing. However, no known SDPs that respond to external mechanical forces have been reported, as it is fundamentally challenging to create mechano&#8208;sensitivity in general and especially so for force levels below those required for classical force&#8208;induced bond scission. To address this challenge, the development of force&#8208;triggered SDPs composed of DNA crosslinked hydrogels doped with nucleases is described here. Externally applied piconewton forces selectively expose enzymatic cleavage sites within the DNA crosslinks, resulting in rapid polymer self&#8208;degradation. The synthesis and the chemical and mechanical characterization of DNA crosslinked hydrogels, as well as the kinetics of force&#8208;triggered hydrolysis, are described. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, force&#8208;triggered and time&#8208;dependent rheological changes in the polymer as well as encapsulated nanoparticle release are demonstrated. Finally, that the kinetics of self&#8208;destruction are shown to be tuned as a function of nuclease concentration, incubation time, and thermodynamic stability of DNA crosslinkers.

         <title>Neural Networks Push the Limits of Luminescence Lifetime Nanosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescence lifetime sensing suffers from loss of precision and reliability in situations of low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. It is shown how the use of neural networks can overcome this limitation, hence enabling precise and reliable luminescence lifetime nanothermometry in extreme measurement&#160;conditions.








Abstract
Luminescence lifetime&#8208;based sensing is ideally suited to monitor biological systems due to its minimal invasiveness and remote working principle. Yet, its applicability is limited in conditions of low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) induced by, e.g., short exposure times and presence of opaque tissues. Herein this limitation is overcome by applying a U&#8208;shaped convolutional neural network (U&#8208;NET) to improve luminescence lifetime estimation under conditions of extremely low SNR. Specifically, the prowess of the U&#8208;NET is showcased in the context of luminescence lifetime thermometry, achieving more precise thermal readouts using Ag2S nanothermometers. Compared to traditional analysis methods of decay curve fitting and integration, the U&#8208;NET can extract average lifetimes more precisely and consistently regardless of the SNR value. The improvement achieved in the sensing performance using the U&#8208;NET is demonstrated with two experiments characterized by extreme measurement conditions: thermal monitoring of free&#8208;falling droplets, and monitoring of thermal transients in suspended droplets through an opaque medium. These results broaden the applicability of luminescence lifetime&#8208;based sensing in fields including in vivo experimentation and microfluidics, while, hopefully, spurring further research on the implementation of machine learning (ML) in luminescence sensing.

         <title>Thermochromic Photonic Crystal Paper with Integrated Multilayer Structure and Fast Thermal Response: A Waterproof and Mechanically Stable Material for Structural&#8208;Colored Thermal Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para) multilayer film is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing. The fast thermal response enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure ensures good stability in daily liquids and enhances its mechanical stability for better user experience.








Abstract
Thermochromic photonic crystals are promising materials for thermal printing due to their unfaded colors under chemical/illuminated environments and the absence of toxic chemicals. However, the slow thermochromic response, the multistep printing procedures, the use of inks or developing liquids, and the requirement of expensive parts in printers limit their applications. Here, a thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para)&#160;film with an integrated multilayer structure is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing that is fully compatible with commercial printers. The fast thermochromic response in milliseconds enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing as the paraffin infiltration and the color change can be finely controlled in a microscale range. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure renders the thermochromic film good stability in daily liquids, which addresses the long&#8208;existing concern of print fading. Meanwhile, the integrated multilayer structure also enhances the mechanical stability when it is deposited on fibrous paper so that people can fold, cut, or staple the thermal papers, and make notes confidently in practical usage.

         <title>Satellite&#8208;type Sulfur Atom Distribution in Trithiocarbonate Bond&#8208;Bridged Dimeric Prodrug Nanoassemblies: Achieving Both Stability and Activatability</title>

Abstract
Homodimeric prodrug nanoassemblies (HDPNs) hold promise for improving the delivery efficiency of chemo&#8208;drugs. However, the key challenge lies in designing rational chemical linkers that can simultaneously ensure the chemical stability, self&#8208;assembly stability and site&#8208;specific activation of prodrugs. The &#8220;in series&#8221; increase in sulfur atoms, such as trisulfide bond, can improve the assembly stability of HDPNs to a certain extent, but limits the chemical stability of prodrugs. Herein, trithiocarbonate bond (&#8208;SC(S)S&#8208;), with a stable &#8220;satellite&#8208;type&#8221; distribution of sulfur atoms, is developed via the insertion of a central carbon atom in trisulfide bonds. &#8208;SC(S)S&#8208; bond effectively addresses the existing predicament of HDPNs by improving the chemical and self&#8208;assembly stability of homodimeric prodrugs while maintaining the on&#8208;demand bioactivation. Furthermore, &#8208;SC(S)S&#8208; bond inhibits antioxidant defense system, leading to up&#8208;regulation of the cellular ROS and apoptosis of tumor cell. These improvements of &#8208;SC(S)S&#8208; bond endow the HDPNs with in vivo longevity and tumor specificity, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic outcomes. &#8208;SC(S)S&#8208; bond is, therefore, promising for overcoming the bottleneck of HDPNs for efficient oncological therapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homodimeric prodrug nanoassemblies (HDPNs) hold promise for improving the delivery efficiency of chemo-drugs. However, the key challenge lies in designing rational chemical linkers that can simultaneously ensure the chemical stability, self-assembly stability and site-specific activation of prodrugs. The &#8220;in series&#8221; increase in sulfur atoms, such as trisulfide bond, can improve the assembly stability of HDPNs to a certain extent, but limits the chemical stability of prodrugs. Herein, trithiocarbonate bond (-SC(S)S-), with a stable &#8220;satellite-type&#8221; distribution of sulfur atoms, is developed via the insertion of a central carbon atom in trisulfide bonds. -SC(S)S- bond effectively addresses the existing predicament of HDPNs by improving the chemical and self-assembly stability of homodimeric prodrugs while maintaining the on-demand bioactivation. Furthermore, -SC(S)S- bond inhibits antioxidant defense system, leading to up-regulation of the cellular ROS and apoptosis of tumor cell. These improvements of -SC(S)S- bond endow the HDPNs with in vivo longevity and tumor specificity, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic outcomes. -SC(S)S- bond is, therefore, promising for overcoming the bottleneck of HDPNs for efficient oncological therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Universal F4&#8208;modified Strategy on Metal Organic Framework to Chemical Stabilize Pvdf&#8208;Hfp as Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) based on metal organic framework (MOF) and polymer mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promotions in both lithium&#8208;ion conduction and interfacial resistance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the unwanted structural evolution and the and the obscure electrochemical reaction mechanism among two phases limit their further optimization and commercial application. Herein, fluorine&#8208;modified zirconium MOF with diverse F&#8208;quantities were synthesized, denoted as Zr&#8208;BDC&#8208;Fx (x = 0, 2, 4), to assemble high performance quais&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) with PVDF&#8208;HFP. The chemical complexation of F&#8208;sites in Zr&#8208;BDC&#8208;F4 stabilized PVDF&#8208;HFP chains in &#946;&#8208;phase and disordered oscillation with enhanced charge transfer and Li transmit property. Besides, the porous confinement and electronegativity of F&#8208;groups enhanced the capture and dissociation of TFSI&#8722; anions and the homogeneous deposition of LiF solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), promoting the high&#8208;efficient transport of Li+ ions and inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, Zr&#8208;BDC&#8208;F4/PVDF&#8208;HFP QSSEs delivered high Li+ conductivity of 5.27 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and superb maintained specific capacities of 145.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C in Li||LFP coin cells after 300 cycles. Even in the pouch cell, the high specific capacity of 121.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 C was achieved with the high stability beyond 300 cycles. Moreover, high&#8208;voltage NCM&#8208;811//Li and high&#8208;loading LFP//Li (high LFP mass loading of 6.82&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte deliver outstanding stable electrochemical performances. More importantly, the universality of F4&#8208;modified strategy the was confirmed by assembling Zn&#8208;BDC&#8208;Fx, Ce&#8208;BDC&#8208;Fx and Fe&#8208;BDC&#8208;Fx (x = 0, 4) QSSEs, which also displayed greatly enhanced 125, 119 and 120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C in Li||LFP coin cells with high stabilities, respectively.

         <title>Engineering Kirigami Frameworks Toward Real&#8208;World Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The surge in advanced manufacturing techniques has led to a paradigm shift in the realm of material design from developing completely new chemistry to tailoring geometry within existing materials. Kirigami, evolved from a traditional cultural and artistic craft of cutting and folding, has emerged as a powerful framework that endows simple two&#8208;dimensional (2D) sheets with unique mechanical, thermal, optical, and acoustic properties, as well as shape&#8208;shifting capabilities. Given its flexibility, versatility, and ease of fabrication, there are significant efforts in developing kirigami algorithms to create various architectured materials for a wide range of applications. In this review, we&#160;summarize the fundamental mechanisms that govern the transformation of kirigami structures and elucidate how these mechanisms contribute to their distinctive properties, including high stretchability and adaptability, tunable surface topography, programmable shape morphing, and characteristics of bistability and multistability. We&#160;then highlight several promising applications enabled by the unique kirigami designs and conclude with an outlook on the future challenges and perspectives of kirigami&#8208;inspired metamaterials toward real&#8208;world&#160;applications.

         <title>Nir&#8208;Ii Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Oxygen Delivery and Controlled Release Improves Photodynamic Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hypoxia, a prominent hallmark of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), undermines curative outcomes, elevates recurrence rates, and fosters metastasis, particularly during photodynamic therapy (PDT) in clinical settings. Studies indicate that alleviating tumor hypoxia can enhance PDT efficacy. However, persistent challenges, including suboptimal oxygen delivery efficiency and absence of real&#8208;time feedback on blood oxygen fluctuations during PDT, considerably impede the therapeutic effectiveness in tumor treatment. This study improves PDT efficacy against HCC using near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic (PA) imaging for tumor&#8208;targeted oxygen delivery and controlled release. For this purpose, a biomimetic oxygen delivery system designated BLICP@O2 is developed, which utilizes hybrid tumor cell membranes and thermosensitive liposomes as oxygen carriers, incorporating the NIR&#8208;II dye IR1048, photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and perfluorohexane. Upon sequential irradiation at 1064&#160;nm and 690&#160;nm, BLICP@O2 exhibits significant photothermal and photodynamic effects. Photothermal heating triggers oxygen release, thus enhancing the photodynamic effect of Ce6. Blood oxygen changes during PDT are tracked by multispectral PA imaging. Enhanced PDT efficacy, mediated by hypoxia relief, is convincingly demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. This work presents an imaging&#8208;guided strategy for tumor&#8208;targeted oxygen delivery and controlled release using dual&#8208;wavelength programmed cascaded treatment strategy, and real&#8208;time efficacy monitoring using PA imaging, offering valuable insights for overcoming challenges in PDT&#8208;based cancer therapy.

         <title>Scalable Solution&#8208;Processed Hybrid Electron Transport Layers for Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells offer the potential to surpass the Shockley&#8208;Queisser (SQ) limit efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells while maintaining the advantages of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;productivity solution processing. However, scalable solution processing of electron transport layer (ETL) in p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured perovskite solar subcells remains challenging due to the rough perovskite film surface and energy level mismatch between ETL and perovskites. Here, we develop scalable solution processing of hybrid fullerenes (HF) with blade&#8208;coating on both wide&#8208;bandgap (&#8764;1.80 eV) and narrow&#8208;bandgap (&#8764;1.25 eV) perovskite films in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules. The HF, comprising a mixture of fullerene (C60), phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct, exhibits improved conductivity, superior energy level alignment with both wide&#8208;bandgap and narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites, and reduced interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination when compared to the conventional thermal&#8208;evaporated C60. With scalable solution&#8208;processed HF as the ETLs, the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2). Our study paves the way to all&#8208;solution processing of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules in the future.

&lt;p&gt;All-perovskite tandem solar cells offer the potential to surpass the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit efficiency of single-junction solar cells while maintaining the advantages of low-cost and high-productivity solution processing. However, scalable solution processing of electron transport layer (ETL) in p-i-n structured perovskite solar subcells remains challenging due to the rough perovskite film surface and energy level mismatch between ETL and perovskites. Here, we develop scalable solution processing of hybrid fullerenes (HF) with blade-coating on both wide-bandgap (&#8764;1.80 eV) and narrow-bandgap (&#8764;1.25 eV) perovskite films in all-perovskite tandem solar modules. The HF, comprising a mixture of fullerene (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;), phenyl C&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt; butyric acid methyl ester and indene-C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; bisadduct, exhibits improved conductivity, superior energy level alignment with both wide-bandgap and narrow-bandgap perovskites, and reduced interfacial non-radiative recombination when compared to the conventional thermal-evaporated C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Heterogenized Molecular Electrocatalyst Based on a Hydroxo&#8208;Bridged Binuclear Copper(II) Phenanthroline Compound for Selective Reduction of CO2 to Ethylene</title>

Abstract
Molecular copper catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Notable features of such systems include the ability of Cu to generate C2+&#160;products and the well&#8208;defined active sites that allow for targeted structural tuning. However, the frequently observed in situ formation of Cu nanoclusters has undermined the advantages of the molecular frameworks. It is therefore desirable to develop Cu&#8208;based catalysts that retain their molecular structures during electrolysis. In this context, we report a heterogenized binuclear hydroxo&#8208;bridged phenanthroline Cu(II) compound with a short Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;Cu distance as a simple yet efficient catalyst for electro&#8208;generation of ethylene and other C2 products. In an aqueous electrolyte, the catalyst demonstrates remarkable performance, with excellent Faradaic efficiency for C2 products (62%) and minimal H2 evolution (8%). Furthermore, it exhibits high stability, manifested by no observable degradation during 15 hours of continuous electrolysis. The preservation of the atomic distribution of the active sites throughout electrolysis is substantiated through comprehensive characterizations, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, as well as control experiments. These findings establish a solid foundation for further investigations into targeted structural tuning, opening new avenues for enhancing the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;based molecular electrocatalysts.

         <title>Arresting Ion Migration from The Etl Increases Stability in Infrared Light Detectors Based on Iii&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of interest in infrared photodetection, and recent developments in CQDs synthesis and surface engineering have improved performance. Here we investigated photodetector stability, finding that the diffusion of zinc ions from charge transport layers (CTLs) into the CQDs active layer increases trap density therein, leading to rapid and irreversible performance loss during operation. In an effort to prevent this, we introduced organic blocking layers between the CQDs and ZnO layers; but these negatively impacted device performance. We then inverted the device, allowing us to use a C60:BCP top ETL for good morphology and process compatibility, and selecting NiOX as the bottom HTL. The first round of NiOX&#8208;based devices showed efficient light response but suffered from high leakage current and a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) due to pinholes. We introduced poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) with NiOX NC to form a hybrid HTL, an addition that reduced pinhole formation, interfacial trap density, and bimolecular recombination, enhancing carrier harvesting. The photodetectors achieve 53% EQE at 970&#160;nm at 1&#160;V applied bias, and they maintain 95% of initial performance after 19 hours of continuous illuminated operation. The photodetectors retain over 80% of performance after 80 days of shelf storage.

         <title>Lipid Droplet Targeting Type I Photosensitizer for Ferroptosis via Lipid Peroxidation Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As an iron&#8208;dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) mediated cell death pathway, ferroptosis offers promises for anti&#8208;tumor treatment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an ideal way to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for LPO. However, the conventional PDT normally functions on subcellular organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria (Mito), and lysosome (Lyso), causing rapid cell death before triggering ferroptosis. Herein, we report the first lipid droplet (Ld)&#8208;targeting type I photosensitizer (PS) with enhanced superoxide anion (O2&#8722;&#183;) production, termed MNBS. The newly designed PS selectively localizes at Ld in cells, and causes cellular LPO accumulation by generating sufficient O2&#8722;&#183; upon irradiation, and subsequently induces ferroptosis mediated chronical PDT, achieving high&#8208;efficient anti&#8208;tumor PDT in hypoxia and normoxia. Theoretical calculations and comprehensive characterizations indicate that the Ld targeting property and enhanced O2&#8722;&#183; generation of MNBS originate from the elevated H&#8208;aggregation tendency owing to dispersed molecular electrostatic distribution. Further in vivo studies using MNBS&#8208;encapsulated liposomes demonstrated the excellent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy as well as anti&#8208;metastatic activity. This study offers a paradigm of H&#8208;aggregation reinforced type I PS to achieve ferroptosis&#8208;mediated PDT.

         <title>Massively Scalable Self&#8208;Assembly of Nano and Microparticle Monolayers via Aerosol Assisted Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An extremely rapid process for self&#8208;assembling well&#8208;ordered, nano and microparticle monolayers via a novel aerosolized method is presented. The novel technique can reach monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates as high as 268 cm2 min&#8722;1 from a single aerosolizing source and methods to reach faster monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates are outlined. A new physical mechanism describing the self&#8208;assembly process is presented and new insights enabling high&#8208;efficiency nanoparticle monolayer self&#8208;assembly are developed. In addition, well&#8208;ordered monolayer arrays from particles of various sizes, surface functionality, and materials are fabricated. This new technique enables a 93x increase in monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates compared to the current state of the art and has the potential to provide an extremely low&#8208;cost option for submicron nanomanufacturing.

         <title>Piezoionic High Performance Hydrogel Generator And Active Protein Absorber via Microscopic Porosity And Phase Blending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Generating electricity in hydrogel is very important but remains difficult. Hydrogel with electricity generation capability are more capable in bio&#8208;relevant tasks such as tissue engineering, artificial skin, or medical treatment, because electricity is indispensable in regulating physiological activities. Here, we develop a porous and phase blending hydrogel structure for effective piezoionic electricity generation. Dynamic electric field are generated taking advantage of the difference in streaming speeds of sodium and chloride in the material. Microscopic porosity and hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic phase blending are the two key factors for prominent piezoionic performance. Voltages as high as 600&#160;mV is first realized in hydrogels in response to medical ultrasound stimulation. The hydrogel structure is also subjective to effective substance exchange and can actively enrich proteins from surroundings under mechanical stimuli. Preliminary applications in neural stimulation, constructing complex spatial&#8208;temporal chemical and electric field distribution patterns, mimetic tactile sensor, sample pretreatment in fast detection, and enzyme immobilization are demonstrated.

         <title>High&#8208;Quality Hybrid Perovskite Thin Films by Post&#8208;Treatment Technologies in Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Incredible progress in photovoltaic devices based on hybrid perovskite materials has been made in the past few decades, and a record&#8208;certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 26% has been achieved in single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, the post&#8208;processing procedures towards perovskites are essential for designing high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films; developing efficient and reliable post&#8208;treatment techniques is very important to promote the progress of PSCs. Here, recent post&#8208;treatment technological reforms towards perovskite thin films are summarized, and the principal functions of the post&#8208;treatment strategies on the design of high&#8208;quality perovskite films have been thoroughly analyzed by dividing into two categories in this review: thermal annealing (TA)&#8208;related technique and TA&#8208;free technique. The latest research progress of the above two types of post&#8208;treatment techniques is summarized and discussed, focusing on the optimization of post&#8208;processing conditions, the regulation of perovskite qualities, and the enhancement of device performance. Finally, an outlook of the prospect trends and future challenges for the fabrication of the perovskite layer and the production of highly efficient PSCs is given.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Driven G&#8208;Quartet&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Materials</title>

Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in chiral functional devices. Synthesizing CPL materials with a high dissymmetry factor (glum) remains a significant challenge. Inspired by efficient machine learning (ML) applications in scientific research, we demonstrate ML&#8208;based techniques for the first time to guide the synthesis of G&#8208;quartet&#8208;based CPL gels with high glum values and multiple chiral regulation strategies. Employing an &#8220;experiment&#8208;prediction&#8208;verification&#8221; approach, we devised a ML classification and regression model for the solvothermal synthesis of G&#8208;quartet gels in deep eutectic solvents. This process illustrates the relationship between various synthesis parameters and the glum value. The decision tree algorithm demonstrated superior performance across six ML models, with model accuracy and determination coefficients amounting to 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. The screened CPL gels exhibiting a glum value up to 0.15 were obtained through combined ML guidance and experimental verification, among the highest ones reported till now for biomolecule&#8208;based CPL systems. These findings indicate that ML can streamline the rational design of chiral nanomaterials, thereby expediting their further development.

         <title>Sampling the Materials Space for Conventional Superconducting Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We&#160;perform a large scale study of conventional superconducting materials using a machine&#8208;learning accelerated high&#8208;throughput workflow. We&#160;start by creating a comprehensive dataset of around 7000 electron&#8208;phonon calculations performed with reasonable convergence parameters. This dataset is then used to train a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the electron&#8208;phonon and superconducting properties based on structural, compositional, and electronic ground&#8208;state properties. Using this machine, we&#160;evaluate the transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 200&#160;000 metallic compounds, all of which on the convex hull of thermodynamic stability (or close to it) to maximize the probability of synthesizability. Compounds predicted to have Tc values exceeding 5&#160;K are further validated using density&#8208;functional perturbation theory. As a result, we&#160;identify 541 compounds with Tc values surpassing 10&#160;K, encompassing a variety of crystal structures and chemical compositions. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds. Particularly noteworthy is LiMoN2, which we&#160;predict to be superconducting in the stoichiometric trigonal phase, with a Tc exceeding 38&#160;K. LiMoN2 has been previously synthesized in this phase, further heightening its potential for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Modular Aptamer Switches for the Continuous Optical Detection of Small&#8208;Molecule Analytes in Complex Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aptamers are a promising class of affinity reagents because signal transduction mechanisms can be built into the reagent, so that they can directly produce a physically measurable output signal upon target binding. However, endowing the signal transduction functionality into an aptamer remains a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process that can compromise its affinity or specificity and typically requires knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure. In this work, we describe a design architecture that can convert an existing aptamer into a &#8220;reversible aptamer&#8208;switch&#8221; whose kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be tuned without a priori knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure. Finally, by combining these aptamer&#8208;switches with evanescent&#8208;field based optical detection hardware that rejects sample autofluorescence, we demonstrate the first optical biosensor system that can continuously measure multiple biomarkers (dopamine and cortisol) in complex samples (artificial cerebrospinal fluid and undiluted plasma) with second&#8208;scale time resolution at physiologically relevant concentration ranges.

         <title>Highly Stable Layered Coordination Polymer Electrocatalyst Towards Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cu2+&#8208;based materials, a class of promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals, usually undergo inevitable and uncontrollable reorganization processes during the reaction, resulting in catalyst deactivation or the new active sites formation and bringing great challenges to exploring their structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, a facile strategy is reported for constructing Cu2+ and 3, 4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) coordination to stabilize Cu2+ ions to prepare a novel layered coordination polymer (CuPEDOT). CuPEDOT enables selective reduction of CO2 to CH4 with 62.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at the current density of 354&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, and the catalyst is stable for at least 15&#160;h. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that CuPEDOT catalyst can maintain the Cu2+&#8208;EDOT coordination structurally stable in CO2RR, and significantly promote the further hydrogenation of *CO intermediates, favoring the formation of CH4 instead of dimerization to C2 products. The strong coordination between EDOT and Cu2+ prevents the reduction of Cu2+ ions during CO2RR. Our finding of this work provides a new perspective on designing molecularly stable, highly active catalysts for CO2RR.

A solution&#8208;processed copper monoiodide (CuI) transistor with boosted mobility through vacancy&#8208;engineering on sodium&#8208;embedded alumina dielectrics is reported. The optimized CuI thin film transistors show high hole mobility of 21.6 &#177; 4.5&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and successfully operate indium gallium zinc oxide&#8208;CuI complementary logic gates, demonstrating the device's applicability.








Abstract
Development of a novel high performing inorganic p&#8208;type thin film transistor could pave the way for new transparent electronic devices. This complements the widely commercialized n&#8208;type counterparts, indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO). Of the few potential candidates, copper monoiodide (CuI) stands out. It boasts visible light transparency and high intrinsic hole mobility (&gt;40 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), and is suitable for various low&#8208;temperature processes. However, the performance of reported CuI transistors is still below expected mobility, mainly due to the uncontrolled excess charge&#8208; and defect&#8208;scattering from thermodynamically favored formation of copper and iodine vacancies. Here, a solution&#8208;processed CuI transistor with a significantly improved mobility is reported. This enhancement is achieved through a room&#8208;temperature vacancy&#8208;engineering processing strategy on high&#8208;k dielectrics, sodium&#8208;embedded alumina. A thorough set of chemical, structural, optical, and electrical analyses elucidates the processing&#8208;dependent vacancy&#8208;modulation and its corresponding transport mechanism in CuI. This encompasses defect&#8208; and phonon&#8208;scattering, as well as the delocalization of charges in crystalline domains. As a result, the optimized CuI thin film transistors exhibit exceptionally high hole mobility of 21.6 &#177; 4.5 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Further, the successful operation of IGZO&#8208;CuI complementary logic gates confirms the applicability of the device.

         <title>Photoelectrons Sequentially Regulate Antibacterial Activity and Osseointegration of Titanium Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Titanium implants are widely used in the biological field, however, implantation occasionally fails due to infection from the microbes during the surgery or poor osseointegration after the surgery. To solve the problem, we have designed an intelligent functional surface on the titanium implant that can sequentially eradicate bacteria biofilm at the initial period of post&#8208;surgery time and promote osseointegration at the late period of post&#8208;surgery time. Such surface can be excited by near infrared light (NIR), with rare earth nanoparticles (RE NPs) to upconvert the NIR light to visible range and adsorbed by Au nanoparticles (Au NPs), supported by TiO2 porous film grown tightly on titanium implants. Under NIR irradiation, the implant converts the energy of phonon to hot electrons and lattice vibrations at the surface, where the former flows directly to the contact substance or partially reacts with the surrounding to generate reactive oxygen species, and the latter leads to the increase of local temperature. The in vitro and in vivo experiments have suggested that the biofilm or microbes on the implant surface could be eradicated by NIR treatment. In addition, the surface exhibits superior biocompatibility for cell survival, adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation, which provides the foundation for osseointegration. In&#8208;vivo implantation experiments (micro&#8208;computed tomography (micro&#8208;CT), histological analysis, etc.) demonstrate that osseointegration is promoted, which could be attributed to the photoelectron&#8208;induced manipulation of the osteogenesis&#8208;related cells, surface topography, and bioactivity of functional nanoparticles. Our work thus has demonstrated that NIR&#8208;generated electrons by upconversion can sequentially eradicate biofilms and regulate the osteogenic process, which provides a new direction to fabricate an efficient implant surface.

         <title>Modulating Charge Separation of Oxygen&#8208;doped Boron Nitride with Isolated Co Atoms for Enhancing CO2&#8208;To&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To alleviate the greenhouse effect and address the related energy crisis, solar&#8208;driven reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added products has been considered as a sustainable strategy. However, the insufficient separation and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalysis greatly limit their reduction efficiency and practical application potential. Here, isolated Co atoms have been successfully decorated into oxygen&#8208;doped BN via an in&#8208;situ pyrolysis method, achieving greatly improved catalytic activity and selectivity to the CO product. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Co atoms have been stabilized by the O and N atoms with an unsaturated CoO2N1 configuration. Further experimental investigation and theoretical simulations confirm that the decorated Co atoms not only work as the real active center during the CO2 reduction process but also perform as the electron pump to promote the electron/hole separation and transfer, resulting in greatly accelerated reaction kinetics and improved activity. In addition, the CoO2N1 coordination geometry is favorable to the conversion from *CO2 to *COOH, which should be considered as a selectivity&#8208;determining step for the evolution of the CO products. The surface modulation strategy at the atomic level opens a new avenue for regulating the reaction kinetics for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Type I Photosensitizer Targeting Glycans: Overcoming Biofilm Resistance by Inhibiting The Two&#8208;Component System, Quorum Sensing, And Multidrug Efflux</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Stubborn biofilm infections pose serious threats to human health due to the persistence, recurrence, and dramatically magnified antibiotic resistance. Photodynamic therapy has emerged as a promising approach to combat biofilm. Nevertheless, how to inhibit the bacterial signal transduction system and the efflux pump to conquer biofilm recurrence and resistance remains a challenging and unaddressed issue. Herein, we developed a boric acid&#8208;functionalized lipophilic cationic type I photosensitizer, ACR&#8208;DMP, which efficiently generates &#8226;OH to overcome the hypoxic microenvironment and photodynamically eradicates methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and biofilms. Furthermore, it not only alters membrane potential homeostasis and osmotic pressure balance due to its strong binding ability with plasma membrane but also inhibits quorum sensing (QS) and the two&#8208;component system (TCS), reduces virulence factors, and regulates the activity of the drug efflux pump attributed to the glycans targeting ability, helping to prevent biofilm recurrence and conquer biofilm resistance. In vivo, ACR&#8208;DMP successfully obliterates MRSA biofilms attached to implanted medical catheters, alleviates inflammation, and promotes vascularization, thereby combating infections and accelerating wound healing. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to combat stubborn biofilm infections and bacterial multidrug resistance but also offers systematic guidance for the rational design of next&#8208;generation advanced antimicrobial materials.

         <title>Optical Nonlinearity Enabled Super&#8208;Resolved Multiplexing Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optical multiplexing for nanoscale object recognition is of great significance within the intricate domains of biology, medicine, anti&#8208;counterfeiting and microscopic imaging. Traditionally, the multiplexing dimensions of nanoscopy are limited to emission intensity, colour, lifetime, and polarization. Here we propose a novel dimension, optical nonlinearity, for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy. This optical nonlinearity is attributable to the energy transitions between multiple energy levels of the doped lanthanide ions in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in unique optical fingerprints for UCNPs with different compositions. We apply a vortex beam to transport the optical nonlinearity onto the imaging point spread function (PSF), creating a robust super&#8208;resolved multiplexing imaging strategy for differentiating UCNPs with distinctive optical nonlinearities. The composition information of the nanoparticles can be retrieved with variations of the corresponding PSF in the obtained image. We demonstrate four channels multiplexed super&#8208;resolved imaging with a single scanning, applying emission colour and nonlinearity of two orthogonal imaging dimensions with a spatial resolution higher than 150&#160;nm (1/6.5 &#955;). Our work provides a new and orthogonal dimension &#8211; optical nonlinearity &#8211; to existing multiplexing dimensions, which shows great potential in bioimaging, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, microarray assays, deep tissue multiplexing detection, and high&#8208;density data storage.

Abstract
Costly data movement in terms of time and energy in traditional von Neumann systems is exacerbated by emerging information technologies related to artificial intelligence (AI). In&#8208;memory computing (IMC) architecture aims to address this problem. Although the IMC hardware prototype represented by a memristor has developed rapidly and performs well, the sneak path issue is a critical and unavoidable challenge prevalent in large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;density crossbar arrays, particularly in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) integration. As a perfect solution to the sneak&#8208;path issue, self&#8208;rectifying memristor (SRM) has been proposed for 3D integration because of its superior integration density. To date, SRMs have performed well in terms of power consumption (&#8764;aJ) and scalability (&gt; 102 Mbit). Moreover, SRM&#8208;configured 3D integration is considered an ideal hardware platform for 3D IMC. This review focuses on the progress in SRMs and their applications in 3D memory, IMC, neuromorphic computing, and hardware security. The advantages, disadvantages, and optimization strategies of SRMs in diverse application scenarios are illustrated. Challenges posed by physical mechanisms, fabrication processes, and peripheral circuits, as well as potential solutions at the device and system levels, are also discussed.

         <title>Self&#8208;powering Sensory Device with Multi&#8208;Spectrum Image Realization for Smart Indoor Environments</title>

Abstract
The development of organic&#8208;based optoelectronic technologies for the indoor Internet of Things market, which relies on ambient energy sources, has increased, with organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) considered promising candidates for sustainable indoor electronic devices. However, the manufacturing processes of standalone OPVs and OPDs can be complex and costly, resulting in high production costs and limited scalability, thus limiting their use in a wide range of indoor applications. This study uses a multi&#8208;component photoactive structure to develop a self&#8208;powering dual&#8208;functional sensory device with effective energy harvesting and sensing capabilities. The optimized device demonstrates improved free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge carrier dynamics, with a high output power density of over 81 and 76 &#956;W/cm2 for rigid and flexible OPVs under indoor conditions (LED 1000&#160;lx (5200 K)). Furthermore, we demonstrate a single&#8208;pixel image sensor as a feasible prototype for practical indoor operating in commercial settings by leveraging the excellent OPD performance with a linear dynamic range of over 130&#160;dB in photovoltaic mode (no external bias). This apparatus with high&#8208;performance OPV&#8208;OPD characteristics provides a roadmap for further exploration of the potential which can lead to synergistic effects for practical multifunctional applications in the real world by their mutual relevance.

However, the manufacturing processes of standalone OPVs and OPDs can be complex and costly, resulting in high production costs and limited scalability, thus limiting their use in a wide range of indoor applications. This study uses a multi-component photoactive structure to develop a self-powering dual-functional sensory device with effective energy harvesting and sensing capabilities. The optimized device demonstrates improved free-charge generation yield by quantifying charge carrier dynamics, with a high output power density of over 81 and 76 &#956;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for rigid and flexible OPVs under indoor conditions (LED 1000&#160;lx (5200 K)). Furthermore, we demonstrate a single-pixel image sensor as a feasible prototype for practical indoor operating in commercial settings by leveraging the excellent OPD performance with a linear dynamic range of over 130&#160;dB in photovoltaic mode (no external bias). This apparatus with high-performance OPV-OPD characteristics provides a roadmap for further exploration of the potential which can lead to synergistic effects for practical multifunctional applications in the real world by their mutual relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tandem Catalysis Inside Double&#8211;shelled Nanocages with Separated and Tunable Atomic Catalyst Sites for High Performance Lithium&#8211;sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs) are effective in mitigating the shuttling effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, but their ideal performance has yet to be achieved due to the multi&#8211;step conversion of LiPSs requiring multifunctional active sites for tandem catalysis. Here we have developed double&#8211;shelled nano&#8208;cages (DSNCs) to address this challenge, featuring separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites as nano reactors that trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. This enables high capacity and durable Li&#8211;S batteries. The DSNCs, with inner Co&#8211;N4 and outer Zn&#8211;N4 sites (S/CoNC@ZnNC DSNCs), exhibit a high specific capacity of 1186 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, along with a low capacity fading rate of 0.063% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm&#8722;2) and a low E/S ratio (6 &#956;L mg&#8722;1), the cell displays excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the Li&#8211;S pouch cells are capable of stable cycling for more than 160 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of driving successive sulfur conversion reactions with separated active sites, and are expected to inspire further catalyst design for high performance Li&#8722;S batteries.

Electronic structure calculations are an essential complement to experiments to characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, simulating SACs with quantum chemistry approaches is not as simple as often thought. Unless a number of essential aspects are adequately considered, the predictive power of electronic structure calculations remains limited. This perspective discusses&#160;what aspects need to be included to perform a reliable simulation of SACs.








Abstract
Electronic structure calculations represent an essential complement of experiments to characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), consisting of isolated metal atoms stabilized on a support, but also to predict new catalysts. However, simulating SACs with quantum chemistry approaches is not as simple as often assumed. In this work,&#160;the essential factors that characterize a reliable simulation of SACs activity are examined. The Perspective focuses on the importance of precise atomistic characterization of the active site, since even small changes in the metal atom's surroundings can result in large changes in reactivity. The dynamical behavior and stability of SACs under working conditions, as well as the importance of adopting appropriate methods to solve the Schr&#246;dinger equation for a quantitative evaluation of reaction energies are addressed. The Perspective also focuses on the relevance of the model adopted. For electrocatalysis this must include the effects of the solvent, the presence of electrolytes, the pH, and the external potential. Finally, it is discussed how the similarities between SACs and coordination compounds may result in reaction intermediates that usually are not observed on metal electrodes. When these aspects are not adequately considered, the predictive power of electronic structure calculations is quite limited.

The organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction platform helps prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) with ultrahigh drug&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) that can be used for personalized anticancer therapy. According to the platform, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with a DAR of 41.6 achieves tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for medium&#8208;sized and large ovarian tumors. Moreover, aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieves TGI of 98.5% for colon tumors.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) have exciting possibilities in targeted tumor therapy. However, in the existing ADC preparation processes, the random attachment of the payloads to the antigen&#8208;binding fragments (Fab) greatly increases the risk of disrupting its antigen recognition ability, while the drug&#8208;antibody ratio&#160;(DAR) is low, leading to a cumbersome preparation process and low drug delivery efficiency. Herein, poly(glutamic acid) is used to expand the number of drug binding sites, based on the &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; of azide and DBCO, and the high affinity of Fc&#8208;III&#8208;4C peptide to the crystalline fragment (Fc) of the monoclonal antibodies. Various antibody&#8208;polymer&#8208;drug conjugates are obtained with ultrahigh DAR using this organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction. Among them, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with DAR of 41.6 achieves tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for both medium&#8208;sized and large SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian tumors, and aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieves TGI of 98.5% for MC38 colon tumors. In summary, a universal platform is created to prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive ADCs with ultrahigh DAR, which can be used to develop precision medicine for personalized anticancer therapy.

         <title>Spatially Controlled UV Light Generation at Depth using Upconversion Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV light can trigger diverse photochemical reactions, yet it is extremely challenging to deliver these high&#8208;energy photons beyond the surface. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) shows great promise to tackle this issue. To demonstrate precision photochemistry at depth, UV&#8208;emitting UC micelles are deployed to photolyze a fluorophore at a focal point nearly a centimeter deep within an aqueous solution.








Abstract
UV light can trigger a plethora of useful photochemical reactions for diverse applications, including photocatalysis, photopolymerization, and drug delivery. These applications typically require penetration of high&#8208;energy photons deep into materials, yet delivering these photons beyond the surface is extremely challenging due to absorption and scattering effects. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) shows great promise to circumvent this issue by generating high&#8208;energy photons from incident lower&#8208;energy photons. However, molecules that facilitate TTA&#8208;UC usually have poor water solubility, limiting their deployment in aqueous environments. To address this challenge, a nanoencapsulation method is leveraged to fabricate water&#8208;compatible UC micelles, enabling on&#8208;demand UV photon generation deep into materials. Two iridium&#8208;based complexes are presented for use as TTA&#8208;UC sensitizers with increased solubilities that facilitate the formation of highly emissive UV&#8208;upconverting micelles. Furthermore, this encapsulation method is shown to be generalizable to nineteen UV&#8208;emitting UC systems, accessing a range of upconverted UV emission profiles with wavelengths as low as 350&#160;nm. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration of precision photochemistry at depth, UV&#8208;emitting UC micelles are used to photolyze a fluorophore at a focal point nearly a centimeter beyond the surface, revealing opportunities for spatially controlled manipulation deep into UV&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite via Green Solvent Assisted Perovskite Single Crystal Redissolution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite single crystal redissolution strategy facilitates direct &#945;&#8208;phase formation with inhibition of complex intermediate phases due to the larger&#8208;sized colloidal clusters present in the precursor solution. The resultant film demonstrates significantly improved crystallization and mitigated defects. This strategy relaxes the lattice strain through isotropic orientation phase growth, contributing to the prolonged &#945;&#8208;phase stability.








Abstract
Perovskite single&#8208;crystal redissolution (PSCR) strategy is highly desired for efficient formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite photovoltaics with enhanced phase purity, improved film quality, low trap&#8208;state density, and good stability. However, the phase transition and crystallization dynamics of FAPbI3 remain unclear in the PSCR process compared to the conventional fabrication from the mixing of precursor materials. In this work, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted (GSA) method is employed to synthesize centimeter&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystals, which serve as the high&#8208;purity precursor to fabricate perovskite films. The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSCR strategy facilitates direct &#945;&#8208;phase formation and inhibits the complex intermediate phases monitored by in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Moreover, the &#945;&#8208;phase stability is prolonged due to the relaxation of the residual lattice strain through the isotropic orientation phase growth. Consequently, the GSA&#8208;assisted PSCR strategy effectively promotes crystallization and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination in perovskite solar cells, which boosts the device efficiency from 22.08% to 23.92% with significantly enhanced open circuit voltage. These findings provide deeper insight into the PSCR process in terms of its efficacy in phase formation and lattice strain release. The green low&#8208;cost solvent may also offer a new and ideal solvent candidate for large&#8208;scale production of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Insight into Defect Engineering of Atomically Dispersed Iron Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic activity of the atomically dispersed iron catalyst is controlled by defect fine&#8208;tuning to achieve remarkable electrocatalytic performance. The defects in the carbon plane modulate the valence and spin states of the Fe centers in Fe&#8208;N4. The change in the atomic and electronic structures of Fe&#8208;N4 leads to a superior MEA performance by optimizing the adsorption of oxygen intermediates.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated iron catalysts (Fe&#8208;NCs) demonstrate potential as alternatives to platinum&#8208;group metal (PGM) catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, in the context of practical proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applications, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) performances of Fe&#8208;NCs remain unsatisfactory. Herein, improved MEA performance is achieved by tuning the local environment of the Fe&#8208;NC catalysts through defect engineering. Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with additional CO2 activation is employed to construct atomically dispersed iron sites with a controlled defect number. The Fe&#8208;NC species with the optimal number of defect sites exhibit excellent ORR performance with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.83&#160;V in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Variation in the number of defects allows for fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction intermediate binding energies by changing the contribution of the Fe d&#8208;orbitals, thereby optimizing the ORR activity. The MEA based on a defect&#8208;engineered Fe&#8208;NC catalyst is found to exhibit a remarkable peak power density of 1.1&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in an H2/O2 fuel cell, and 0.67&#160;W cm&#8722;2&#8197;in an H2/air fuel cell, rendering it one of the most active atomically dispersed catalyst materials at the MEA level.

         <title>Light&#8208;Based 3D Printing of Complex&#8208;Shaped Photonic Colloidal Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic colloidal glasses with isotropic structural color can be shaped into complex objects by light&#8208;based 3D printing and calcination. Printed and calcined parts rely on sustainable, non&#8208;bleaching colloidal particles for color formation, making them an attractive alternative to traditional pigments in applications such as security features, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Colloidal glasses display angle&#8208;independent structural color that is tunable by the size and local arrangement of sub&#8208;micrometer particles. While films, droplets, and microcapsules with isotropic structural color have been demonstrated, the shaping of colloidal glasses in three dimensions remains an open manufacturing challenge. Here, a light&#8208;based printing platform for the shaping of colloidal glasses into 3D objects featuring complex geometries and vivid structural color after thermal treatment is reported. Rheology, photopolymerization, and calcination experiments are performed to design the photoreactive resins leading to printable colloidal glasses. With the help of microscopy, scattering, and optical characterization, it is shown that the photonic properties of the printed objects reflect the locally ordered microstructure of the glass. The capability of the platform in creating 3D objects with isotropic structural color is illustrated by printing lattices and miniaturized sculpture replicas with unique shapes and multimaterial designs.

         <title>Exceptional Microscale Plasticity in Amorphous Aluminum Oxide at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasticity in ceramics, including oxide glasses, is difficult to achieve and typically occurs only at high temperatures. Amorphous aluminum oxide (a&#8208;Al2O3) makes an exception to the rule by showing substantial ductility at room temperature. The microscale compression samples (micropillars with 2.25&#8211;11 &#181;m diameter) are shown to deform without fracture even under fast impact loading resembling for example hammer forging.








Abstract
Oxide glasses are an elementary group of materials in modern society, but brittleness limits their wider usability at room temperature. As an exception to the rule, amorphous aluminum oxide (a&#8208;Al2O3) is a rare diatomic glassy material exhibiting significant nanoscale plasticity at room temperature. Here, it is shown experimentally that the room temperature plasticity of a&#8208;Al2O3 extends to the microscale and high strain rates using in situ micropillar compression. All tested a&#8208;Al2O3 micropillars deform without fracture at up to 50% strain via a combined mechanism of viscous creep and shear band slip propagation. Large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations align with the main experimental observations and verify the plasticity mechanism at the atomic scale. The experimental strain rates reach magnitudes typical for impact loading scenarios, such as hammer forging, with strain rates up to the order of 1 000 s&#8722;1, and the total a&#8208;Al2O3 sample volume exhibiting significant low&#8208;temperature plasticity without fracture is expanded by 5 orders of magnitude from previous observations. The discovery is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the plasticity observed in a&#8208;Al2O3 can extend to macroscopic bulk scale and suggests that amorphous oxides show significant potential to be used as light, high&#8208;strength, and damage&#8208;tolerant engineering materials.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Layer Hollow Structure of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with High 1T&#8208;Phase Purity for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic strategy for fabricating single&#8208;layer hollow structures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with high 1T&#8208;phase purity is developed by selectively etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures. The obtained single&#8208;layer hollow structure of 1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits excellent electrochemical activity and durable stability in hydrogen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Rational design and controllable synthesis of hollow structures based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained tremendous attention in the field of clean energy. However, the general synthetic strategies to fabricate single&#8208;layer hollow structures of TMDs, especially with unconventional phases (e.g., 1T or 1T&#8242;), still pose significant challenges. Herein, a scalable method is reported for the synthesis of single&#8208;layer hollow spheres (SLHS) of TMDs with high 1T&#8208;phase purity by etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures including SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WS2, and SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WSe2. Additionally, the etched Bi ions can be adsorbed on the single&#8208;layer TMDs shells in the form of single atoms (SAs) via the Bi&#9472;S bond. Due to the benefits of the single&#8208;layer hollow structure, high conductivity of 1T phase, and synergistic effect of Bi SAs and TMDs supports, the fabricated SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production. This work provides a way to manufacture advanced functional materials based on the single&#8208;layer hollow structures of 1T&#8208;TMDs and to expand their applications.

         <title>Diels&#8211;Alder Photoclick Patterning of Extracellular Matrix for Spatially Controlled Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;free, Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;based photopatterning platform is presented which enables the spatially defined modification of protein&#8208;based hydrogels with dienophile&#8208;bearing biomolecules. By utilizing commercially available maleimide&#8208;functionalized streptavidin and biotinylated species of interest, a robust mix&#8208;and&#8208;match platform is demonstrated. Through the immobilization of biotinylated growth factors, the use of these engineered substrates to program cell behaviors is highlighted.








Abstract
Strategies that mimic the spatial complexity of natural tissues can provide cellular scaffolds to probe fundamental questions in cell biology and offer new materials for regenerative medicine. Here, the authors demonstrate a light&#8208;guided patterning platform that uses natural engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as a substrate to program cellular behaviors. A photocaged diene which undergoes Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;based click chemistry upon uncaging with 365&#160;nm light is utilized. By interfacing with commercially available maleimide dienophiles, patterning of common ECM proteins (collagen, fibronectin Matrigel, laminin) with readily purchased functional small molecules and growth factors is achieved. Finally, the use of this platform to spatially control ERK activity and migration in mammalian cells is highlighted, demonstrating programmable cell behavior through patterned chemical modification of natural ECM.

         <title>Esterase&#8208;Labile Quaternium Lipidoid Enabling Improved mRNA&#8208;LNP Stability and Spleen&#8208;Selective mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipidoids is constructed with the aim to develop new AMB&#8208;POC18 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for robust messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection exclusively in the spleen. The AMB&#8208;POC18 LNPs encapsulating tumor antigen mRNA can effectively transfect antigen&#8208;presenting cells, induce the proliferation of effector T cells, and exhibit potent therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against melanoma without side effects.









Abstract
Ionizable cationic lipids are recognized as an essential component of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery but can be confounded by low lipoplex stability with mRNA during storage and in vivo delivery. Herein, the rational design and combinatorial synthesis of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipid&#8208;like molecules (lipidoids) are reported to develop new LNPs with high delivery efficiency and improved storage stability. This top lipidoid carries positive charges at the physiological condition but promptly acquires negative charges in the presence of esterase, thus permitting stable mRNA encapsulation during storage and in vivo delivery while balancing efficient mRNA release in the cytosol. An optimal LNP formulation is then identified through orthogonal optimization, which enables efficacious mRNA transfection selectively in the spleen following intravenous administration. LNP&#8208;mediated delivery of ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;encoding mRNA induces efficient antigen expression in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and elicits robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses against OVA&#8208;transduced tumors. The work demonstrates the potential of decationizable quaternium lipidoids for spleen&#8208;selective RNA transfection and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Spiral&#8208;Structured Dielectric Polymers Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiral&#8208;structured dielectric polymers are demonstrated to avoid the electronic conjugation of the polymer chain while maintaining a decent thermal stability, as inspired by the double helix structure of DNA, leading to ultrahigh energy density of 7.29 and 6.13 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with charge&#8211;discharge efficiency above 90% at 150 and 200&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
The growing need for high&#8208;power and compact&#8208;size energy storage in modern electronic and electrical systems demands polymer film capacitors with excellent temperature capability. However, conventional polymer dielectrics feature dramatic deterioration in capacitive performance under concurrent high temperature and electric field because the high thermal stability traditionally relies on the conjugated, planar molecular segments in the polymer chains. Herein, inspired by the stable double helix structures of deoxyribonucleic acid, spiral&#8208;structured dielectric polymers that exhibit simultaneous high thermal stability and great capacitive performance are demonstrated. Both the experimental results and computational simulations confirm that the spiral groups serve to weaken the electrostatic molecular interaction, induce proper molecular chain stacking structure, and regulate the charge transfer process by breaking the conjugated planes and introducing deep trap sites. The resultant polymer exhibits the maximum discharged energy densities of 7.29 and 6.13 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with the charge&#8211;discharge efficiency above 90% at 150 and 200&#160;&#176;C, respectively, more than ten times those of the original dielectric at the same conditions. Here a completely new dimension is offered for the molecular design of polymers, giving rise to well&#8208;balanced thermal and dielectric properties, and ultimately the desired capacitive energy storage performance at high temperatures.

         <title>Tailoring the Atomic&#8208;Local Environment of Carbon Nanotube Tips for Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reasonably regulating the atomic&#8208;local environment of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts is critical for upgrading the catalytic activity of a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, N,S co&#8208;modified atomic environment of carbon nanotube (CNT) zigzag edges is developed, which endows the CNTs with high activity, selectivity, and stability for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis from the air in both flow cell and solid&#8208;electrolyte configuration.








Abstract
The atomic&#8208;local environment of catalytically active sites plays an important role in tuning the activity of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts (C&#8208;MFECs). However, the rational regulation of the environment is always impeded by synthetic limitations and insufficient understanding of the formation mechanism of the catalytic sites. Herein, the possible cleavage mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the crossing points during ball&#8208;milling is proposed, resulting in abundant CNT tips that are more susceptible to be modified by heteroatoms, achieving precise modulation of the atomic environment at the tips. The obtained CNTs with N,S&#8208;rich tips (N,S&#8208;TCNTs) exhibit a wide potential window of 0.59&#160;V along with H2O2 selectivity for over 90.0%. Even using air as the O2 source, the flow cell system with N,S&#8208;TCNTs catalyst attains high H2O2 productivity up to 30.37&#160;mol&#160;gcat.&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1@350&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, superior to most reported C&#8208;MFECs. From a practical point of view, a solid electrolyzer based on N,S&#8208;TCNTs is further employed to realize the in&#8208;situ continuous generation of pure H2O2 solution with high productivity (up to 4.35&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1@300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2; over 300&#160;h). The CNTs with functionalized tips hold great promise for practical applications, even beyond H2O2 generation.

&lt;p&gt;Reasonably regulating the atomic-local environment of carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts is critical for upgrading the catalytic activity of a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, N,S co-modified atomic environment of carbon nanotube (CNT) zigzag edges is developed, which endows the CNTs with high activity, selectivity, and stability for electrochemical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis from the air in both flow cell and solid-electrolyte configuration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atomic-local environment of catalytically active sites plays an important role in tuning the activity of carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts (C-MFECs). However, the rational regulation of the environment is always impeded by synthetic limitations and insufficient understanding of the formation mechanism of the catalytic sites. Herein, the possible cleavage mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the crossing points during ball-milling is proposed, resulting in abundant CNT tips that are more susceptible to be modified by heteroatoms, achieving precise modulation of the atomic environment at the tips. The obtained CNTs with N,S-rich tips (N,S-TCNTs) exhibit a wide potential window of 0.59&#160;V along with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity for over 90.0%. Even using air as the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source, the flow cell system with N,S-TCNTs catalyst attains high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; productivity up to 30.37&#160;mol&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@350&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to most reported C-MFECs. From a practical point of view, a solid electrolyzer based on N,S-TCNTs is further employed to realize the in-situ continuous generation of pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution with high productivity (up to 4.35&#160;mmol&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@300&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; over 300&#160;h). The CNTs with functionalized tips hold great promise for practical applications, even beyond H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable, Excitation&#8208;Dependent, and Water Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Cellulose for Versatile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined with the advantages of conventional conjugated aromatic luminescence and macromolecular cluster luminescence, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine rings are synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction. The resulting transparent films exhibit color&#8208;tunable, excitation&#8208;dependent, and water stimulus&#8208;response afterglows, giving an impressive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence lifetime of up to 1251&#160;ms.








Abstract
Smart&#8208;response materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desirable, but they have rarely been described, especially those originating from sustainable polymers. Herein, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (DHP) rings are synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction, giving impressive RTP with a long lifetime of up to 1251&#160;ms. Specifically, the introduction of acetoacetyl groups and DHP rings promotes the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing process; and multiple interactions between cellulose induce clustering and inhibit the nonradiative transitions, boosting long&#8208;live RTP. Furthermore, the resulting transparent and flexible cellulose films also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable afterglows by introducing different extended aromatic groups. More interestingly, the RTP performance of these films is sensitive to water and can be repeated in response to wet/dry stimuli. Inspired by these advantages, the RTP cellulose demonstrates advanced applications in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work not only enriches the photophysical properties of cellulose but also provides a versatile platform for the development of sustainable afterglows.

         <title>Permittivity&#8208;Based Microparticle Classification by the Integration of Impedance Cytometry and Microwave Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material classification is achieved by measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles through a novel sensing platform that combines impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. Polystyrene and soda&#8208;lime glass microparticles are successfully classified, while differentiating between healthy and fixed cells. This paves the way for targeted applications in environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical quality control.








Abstract
Permittivity of microscopic particles can be used as a classification parameter for applications in materials and environmental sciences. However, directly measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles has proven to be challenging due to the convoluting effect of particle size on capacitive signals. To overcome this challenge, a sensing platform is built to independently obtain both the geometric and electric size of a particle, by combining impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. This way the microwave signal, which contains both permittivity and size effects, can be normalized by the size information provided by impedance cytometry to yield an intensive parameter that depends only on permittivity. The technique allows to differentiate between polystyrene and soda lime glass microparticles&#8212;below 22&#160;&#181;m in diameter&#8212;with more than 94% accuracy, despite their similar sizes and electrical characteristics. Furthermore, it is shown that the same technique can be used to differentiate between normal healthy cells and fixed cells of the same geometric size. The technique offers a potential route for targeted applications such as environmental monitoring of microplastic pollution or quality control in pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Body Biomarker Entrapment System: An All&#8208;Encompassing Tool for Ultrasensitive Disease Diagnosis and Epidemic Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;body biomarker entrapment system based on a carbon nanotube liquid&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor and DNA framework engineering is proposed. This versatile platform enables clinical diagnosis of endometriosis, specific recognition of monkeypox virus antigen protein, and non&#8208;amplification identification of circulating tumor DNA in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.








Abstract
Ultrasensitive identification of biomarkers in biofluids is essential for the precise diagnosis of diseases. For the gold standard approaches, polymerase chain reaction and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay, cumbersome operational steps hinder their point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. Here, a bionic biomarker entrapment system (BioES) is implemented, which employs a multi&#8208;body Y&#8208;shaped tetrahedral DNA probe immobilized on carbon nanotube transistors. Clinical identification of endometriosis is successfully realized by detecting an estrogen receptor, ER&#946;, from the lesion tissue of endometriosis patients and establishing a standard diagnosis procedure. The multi&#8208;body Y&#8208;shaped BioES achieves a theoretical limit of detection (LoD) of 6.74 aM and a limit of quantification&#160;of 141&#160;aM in a complex protein milieu. Furthermore, the BioES is optimized into a multi&#8208;site recognition module for enhanced binding efficiency, realizing the first identification of monkeypox virus antigen A35R and unamplified detection of circulating tumor DNA of breast cancer in serum. The rigid and compact probe framework with synergy effect enables the BioES to target A35R and DNA with a LoD down to 991 and 0.21&#160;aM, respectively. Owing to its versatility for proteins and nucleic acids as well as ease of manipulation and ultra&#8208;sensitivity, the BioES can be leveraged as an all&#8208;encompassing tool for population&#8208;wide screening of epidemics and clinical disease diagnosis.

         <title>Enriching Metal&#8211;Oxygen Species and Phosphate Modulating of Active Sites for Robust Electrocatalytical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface PO43&#8208; anions modulate the local microenvironment with abundant K+ ions and accelerate the formation of metal&#8211;oxygen species, optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts, and inhibit the side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, thus delivering a high jHCOO&#8722; of 279.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE.








Abstract
Direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions. The activity of CO2RR is influenced deeply by the reaction microenvironment and electronic properties of the catalysts. Herein, the surface PO43&#8722; anions are tuned to modulate the local microenvironment and the electronic properties of the indium&#8208;based catalyst with abundant metal&#8211;oxygen species enabling efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2 to HCOO&#8722;. Indium nanoparticles coupled with PO43&#8722; anions (PO43&#8722;&#8208;In NPs) achieve a high selectivity of HCOO&#8722; up to 91.4% at a low potential of &#8722;0.98&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (versus RHE) and a high HCOO&#8722; partial current density of 279.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE in the electrochemical flow cell. In&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ characterizations confirm the PO43&#8722; anions keep stable on the surface of indium during CO2RR, accelerating the generation of OCHO* intermediate. From density functional theory calculations, PO43&#8722; anions enrich the metal&#8211;oxygen species on the substrate to optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts and induce a local microenvironment with massive K+ ions on the interface, thus reducing the activation energy barrier of CO2RR.

&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions are tuned to modulate the local microenvironment and the electronic properties of the indium-based catalyst with abundant metal&#8211;oxygen species enabling efficient electrochemical conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Indium nanoparticles coupled with PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-In NPs) achieve a high selectivity of HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; up to 91.4% at a low potential of &#8722;0.98&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (versus RHE) and a high HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; partial current density of 279.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE in the electrochemical flow cell. In&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ characterizations confirm the PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions keep stable on the surface of indium during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, accelerating the generation of OCHO&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate. From density functional theory calculations, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions enrich the metal&#8211;oxygen species on the substrate to optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts and induce a local microenvironment with massive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions on the interface, thus reducing the activation energy barrier of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Compact Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Enabled by Disassembling Micelles in Solution for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles formed by the amphiphilic self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM)&#160;molecules is introduced. The pre&#8208;disassembly of micelles reduces the energetic barrier to form a densely packed SAM. This strategy universally enhances the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs based on MeO&#8208;2PACz, 2PACz, and CbzNaph SAM hole&#8208;selective layers. The champion device based on the CbzNaph processed from co&#8208;solvent achieves a high PCE of 24.98% with an impressive fill factor of 85.06%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are widely employed as effective hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most SAM molecules are amphiphilic in nature and tend to form micelles in the commonly used alcoholic processing solvents. This introduces an extra energetic barrier to disassemble the micelles during the binding of SAM molecules on the substrate surface, limiting the formation of a compact SAM. To alleviate this problem for achieving optimal SAM growth, a co&#8208;solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles of carbazole&#8208;based SAM molecules in the processing solution is developed. This effectively increases the critical micelle concentration to be above the processing concentration and enhances the reactivity of the phosphonic acid anchoring group to allow densely packed SAMs to be formed on indium tin oxide. Consequently, the PSCs derived from using MeO&#8208;2PACz, 2PACz, and CbzNaph SAM HSLs show universally improved performance, with the CbzNaph SAM&#8208;derived device achieving a champion efficiency of 24.98% and improved stability.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Voltage, High&#8208;Force Capacity Electroadhesive Clutch Based on Ionoelastomer Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough ionoelastomer&#8208;metal mesh composites with low surface energies and controlled surface roughness are synthesized to realize sub&#8208;ten&#8208;volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models from fracture mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface roughness affect force capacity. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art by 5&#8208;fold in force capacity per unit area, with a 40&#8208;fold reduction in operating voltage.








Abstract
Electroadhesive devices with dielectric films can electrically program changes in stiffness and adhesion, but require hundreds of volts and are subject to failure by dielectric breakdown. Recent work on ionoelastomer heterojunctions has enabled reversible electroadhesion with low voltages, but these materials exhibit limited force capacities and high detachment forces. It is a grand challenge to engineer electroadhesives with large force capacities and programmable detachment at low voltages (&lt;10&#160;V). In this work, tough ionoelastomer/metal mesh composites with low surface energies are synthesized and surface roughness is controlled to realize sub&#8208;ten&#8208;volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models based on fracture and contact mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface texture affect force capacity and contact area, which is validated over different geometries and voltages. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the best existing electroadhesive clutches by fivefold in force capacity per unit area (102 N cm&#8722;2), with a 40&#8208;fold reduction in operating voltage (&#177; 7.5&#160;V). Finally, the ability of the ionoelastomer clutches to resist bending moments in a finger wearable and as a reversible adhesive in an adjustable phone mount is demonstrated.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries Boosted by a Multifunctional Janus Separator Over a Wide Temperature Range of &#8722;30 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C</title>

A Janus separator coated by hierarchical nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) and AlN nanowires on polypropylene separator is constructed to achieve high&#8208;rate performances of Li&#8211;Se batteries over &#8722;30&#8211;60 &#176;C. The excellent performances result from &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergism of suppressed &#8216;shuttling effect&#8217; by hNCNC on cathode side and suppressed Li&#8208;dendrites by AlN&#8208;network on anode side, well understood by the &#8220;Bucket Effect&#8221;.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;selenium batteries are characterized by high volumetric capacity comparable to Li&#8211;S batteries, while &#8776;1025 times higher electrical conductivity of Se than S is favorable for high&#8208;rate capability. However, they also suffer from the &#8220;shuttling effect&#8221; of lithium polyselenides (LPSes) and Li dendrite growth. Herein, a multifunctional Janus separator is designed by coating hierarchical nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) and AlN nanowires on two sides of commercial polypropylene (PP) separator to overcome these hindrances. At room temperature, the Li&#8211;Se batteries with the Janus separator exhibit an unprecedented high&#8208;rate capability (331 mAh g&#8722;1 at 25 C) and retain a high capacity of 408 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C after 500 cycles. Moreover, the high retained capacities are achieved over a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C, showing the potential application under extreme environments. The excellent performances result from the &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergism of suppressed LPSes shuttling by chemisorption and electrocatalysis of hNCNC on the cathode side and suppressed Li&#8208;dendrite growth by thermally conductive AlN&#8208;network on the anode side, which can be well understood by the &#8220;Bucket Effect&#8221;. This Janus separator provides a general strategy to develop high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;chalcogen (Se, S, SeS2) batteries.

         <title>Realizing Unassisted Photo&#8208;Charging of Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries by Anisotropic Charge Separation in Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode visualized by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) improves the charge separation, enabling unassisted photo&#8208;charging of a zinc&#8211;air battery at 1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.45%.








Abstract
Solar rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery is a promising approach for capturing and storing intermittent solar energy through photoelectrochemical reactions. However, unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8211;air batteries is challenging due to suboptimal carrier accumulation on photoelectrodes, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8211;air battery is achieved by investigating anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a series of representative semiconductors (ZnIn2S4, TiO2, and In2O3), among which the exceptional anisotropic charge separation on a ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode is revealed based on anisotropic charge diffusion capabilities. The charge separation is facet&#8208;dependent, which is observed using Kelvin probe force microscopy, verifying a cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationship between the photo&#8208;charge accumulation on photoelectrodes and their photo&#8208;charging performance in zinc&#8211;air batteries. This work achieves an unassisted photo&#8208;charging current density of 1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.45%, highlighting the importance of anisotropic semiconductors for unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8211;air batteries via efficient photogenerated charge separation.

&lt;p&gt;Anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoelectrode visualized by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) improves the charge separation, enabling unassisted photo-charging of a zinc&#8211;air battery at 1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.45%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery is a promising approach for capturing and storing intermittent solar energy through photoelectrochemical reactions. However, unassisted photo-charging of zinc&#8211;air batteries is challenging due to suboptimal carrier accumulation on photoelectrodes, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, unassisted photo-charging of zinc&#8211;air battery is achieved by investigating anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a series of representative semiconductors (ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), among which the exceptional anisotropic charge separation on a ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoelectrode is revealed based on anisotropic charge diffusion capabilities. The charge separation is facet-dependent, which is observed using Kelvin probe force microscopy, verifying a cause-and-effect relationship between the photo-charge accumulation on photoelectrodes and their photo-charging performance in zinc&#8211;air batteries. This work achieves an unassisted photo-charging current density of 1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.45%, highlighting the importance of anisotropic semiconductors for unassisted photo-charging of zinc&#8211;air batteries via efficient photogenerated charge separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Active Hydrogen Adsorption on Fe&#9472;N Interface for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with Ultra&#8208;Long Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8211;N interface is designed to ameliorate the utilization of active hydrogen for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction to suppress the occurrence of hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC harvests superb stability due to the dual reinforcement of the internal Fe2N and the external carbon layer. This catalyst exhibits trade&#8208;offs between the scale&#8208;up application and the nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to nitrogen (N2) is an environmentally friendly approach for efficient N&#8208;cycle management (toward a nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle). However, poor catalyst durability and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly impede its practical application. Interface&#8208;chemistry engineering, utilizing the close relationship between the catalyst surface/interface microenvironment and electron/proton transfer process, has facilitated the development of catalysts with high intrinsic activity and physicochemical durability. This study reports the synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated rice&#8208;like iron nitride (RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC) electrocatalyst with excellent electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;reduction reaction activity (high N2 selectivity (&#8776;96%) and NO3&#8722; conversion (&#8776;86%)). According to detailed mechanistic investigations by in situ tests and theoretical calculations, the strong hydrogenation ability of iron nitride and enhanced nitrate enrichment of the system synergistically contribute to the rapid hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing species, increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and reducing the occurrence of the competing hydrogen&#8208;evolution side reaction. Moreover, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC shows excellent stability, retaining good NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;N2 electrocatalysis activity for more than 40 cycles (one cycle per day). This paper could guide the interfacial design of Fe&#8208;based composite nanostructures for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction, facilitating a shift toward nitrogen neutrality.

         <title>Flexible Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Epitaxially Grown Nanocrystals for Micro&#8208;Thermoelectric Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an unconventional heteroepitaxial growth strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance flexible and freestanding thermoelectric film with ordered and uniform microstructures. The integrated micro&#8208;thermoelectric module based on the above films exhibits excellent energy harvesting and cooling performance, validating the potential of freestanding thermoelectric films for thermal energy efficient harvesting and management.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric materials have attracted increasing interest because of their potential use in thermal energy harvesting and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal management. However, a high&#8208;performance flexible micro&#8208;thermoelectric device (TED) compatible with the microelectronics fabrication process has not yet been developed. Here a universal epitaxial growth strategy is reported guided by 1D van der Waals&#8208;coupling, to fabricate freestanding and flexible hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes and ordered (Bi,Sb)2Te3 nanocrystals. High power factors ranging from &#8776;1680 to &#8776;1020 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in the temperature range of 300&#8211;480 K, combined with a low thermal conductivity yield a high average figure of merit of &#8776;0.81. The fabricated flexible micro&#8208;TED module consisting of two p&#8211;n couples of freestanding thermoelectric hybrids has an unprecedented open circuit voltage of &#8776;22.7 mV and a power density of &#8776;0.36 W cm&#8722;2 under &#8776;30 K temperature difference, and a net cooling temperature of &#8776;22.4 K and a heat absorption density of &#8776;92.5 W cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Spatial Position Regulation of Cu Single Atom Site Realizes Efficient Nanozyme Photocatalytic Bactericidal Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of Cu single&#8208;atom site nanozymes in the interlayer and in&#8208;plane of PHI are synthesized through different synthesis pathways. Compared with the Cu atoms located within the PHI plane, the interlayer position of PHI is more conducive to photoelectron migration and O2 adsorption and activation, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics.








Abstract
Recently, single&#8208;atom nanozymes have made significant progress in the fields of sterilization and treatment, but their catalytic performance as substitutes for natural enzymes and drugs is far from satisfactory. Here, a method is reported to improve enzyme activity by adjusting the spatial position of a single&#8208;atom site on the nanoplatforms. Two types of Cu single&#8208;atom site nanozymes are synthesized in the interlayer (CuL/PHI) and in&#8208;plane (CuP/PHI) of poly (heptazine imide) (PHI) through different synthesis pathways. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the interlayer position of PHI can effectively adjust the coordination number, coordination bond length, and electronic structure of Cu single atoms compared to the in&#8208;plane position, thereby promoting photoinduced electron migration and O2 activation, enabling effective generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of CuL/PHI against aureus is &#8776;100%, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics, after 10&#160;min of low&#8208;dose light exposure and 2&#160;h of incubation.

         <title>Solution Processed Semi&#8208;Transparent Organic Solar Cells Over 50% Visible Transmittance Enabled by Silver Nanowire Electrode with Sandwich Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed sandwich structure silver&#8208;nanowires top electrode is designed for semi&#8208;transparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) to address conductivity and processibility issues. Compared with traditional evaporated Ag counterpart, ST&#8208;OPV based on the new electrode achieves more excellent optical and electrical properties, including light utilization efficiency, transmittance, reflection rate, viewing angle, and can tolerate harsher mechanical bending on flexible substrates.








Abstract
Photovoltaic windows with easy installation for the power supply of household appliances have long been a desire of energy researchers. However, due to the lack of top electrodes that offer both high transparency and low sheet resistance, the development of high&#8208;transparency photovoltaic windows for indoor lighting scenarios has lagged significantly behind photovoltaic windows where privacy issues are involved. Addressing this issue, this work develops a solution&#8208;processable transparent top electrode using sandwich structure silver nanowires, realizing high transparency in semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. The wettability and conducting properties of the electrode are improved by a modified hole&#8208;transport layer named HP. The semi&#8208;transparent solar cell exhibits good see&#8208;through properties at a high average visible transmittance of 50.8%, with power conversion efficiency of 7.34%, and light utilization efficiency of 3.73%, which is the highest without optical modulations. Moreover, flexible devices based on the above&#8208;mentioned architecture also show excellent mechanical tolerance compared with Ag electrode counterparts, which retains 94.5% of their original efficiency after 1500 bending cycles. This work provides a valuable approach for fabricating solution&#8208;processed high transparency organic solar cells, which is essential in future applications in building integrated photovoltaics.

The semi-transparent solar cell exhibits good see-through properties at a high average visible transmittance of 50.8%, with power conversion efficiency of 7.34%, and light utilization efficiency of 3.73%, which is the highest without optical modulations. Moreover, flexible devices based on the above-mentioned architecture also show excellent mechanical tolerance compared with Ag electrode counterparts, which retains 94.5% of their original efficiency after 1500 bending cycles. This work provides a valuable approach for fabricating solution-processed high transparency organic solar cells, which is essential in future applications in building integrated photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Load Gemcitabine Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Nanoparticles as an Image&#8208;Guided Tumor&#8208;Selective Drug&#8208;Delivery System to Treat Pancreatic Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanoparticles with extraordinary high load of gemcitabine phosphate (GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs) show excellent efficacy to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), including efficient and selective uptake to tumor and metastasis, multiscale tracking, low side effects, and circumventing chemoresistance.








Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a devastating prognosis without effective treatment options. Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective and safe therapies. Here, inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanoparticles (GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs) are presented as a novel drug&#8208;delivery system for the selective delivery of extraordinarily high concentrations of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP), not only to the primary tumor but also to metastatic sites. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs have a composition of [ZrO]2+[GMP]2&#8722; with GMP as drug anion (76% of total IOH&#8208;NP mass). Multiscale fluorescence imaging confirms an efficient uptake in tumor cells, independent of the activity of the human&#8208;equilibrative&#8208;nucleoside transporter (hENT1), being responsible for gemcitabine (GEM) transport into cells and a key factor for GEM resistance. Delivering already phosphorylated GMP via GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs into tumor cells also allows the&#160;cellular resistance induced by the downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase to be overcome. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs show high accumulation in tumor lesions and only minor liver trapping when given intraperitoneally. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs result in a higher antitumor efficacy compared to free GEM, which is further enhanced applying cetuximab&#8208;functionalized GMP&#8208;CTX&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs. By maximizing the therapeutic benefits with high drug load, tumor&#8208;specific delivery, minimizing undesired side effects, overcoming mechanisms of chemoresistance, and preventing systemic GEM inactivation, GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs are anticipated to have a high chance to significantly improve current PDAC&#8208;patient outcome.

         <title>Flash&#8208;Thermal Shock Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Toward High&#8208;Performance Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flash&#8208;thermal shock (FTS)&#8208;driven synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers and other 2D materials is presented. In particular, the FTS method merits scalability (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2), rapid synthesis (&gt;1800 &#160;&#176;C within 20 ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1), and ambient air processing. To prove their practical utility, high electrocatalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) provide unprecedented physicochemical properties over unary nanoparticles (NPs). According to the conventional alloying guideline (Hume&#8211;Rothery rule), however, only size&#8208;and&#8208;structure similar elements can be mixed, limiting the possible combinations of alloying elements. Recently, it has been reported that based on carbon thermal shocks (CTS) in a vacuum atmosphere at high temperature, ultrafast heating/cooling rates and high&#8208;entropy environment play a critical role in the synthesis of HEAs, ruling out the possibility of phase separation. Since the CTS requires conducting supports, the Joule&#8208;heating efficiencies rely on the carbon qualities, featuring difficulties in uniform heating along the large area. This work proposes a photo&#8208;thermal approach as an alternative and innovative synthetic method that is compatible with ambient air, large&#8208;area, remote process, and free of materials selection. Single flash irradiation on carbon nanofibers induced momentary high&#8208;temperature annealing (&gt;1800&#160;&#176;C within 20&#160;ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1) to successfully decorate HEA NPs up to nine elements with excellent compatibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2 of carbon nanofiber paper). To demonstrate their feasibility toward applications, senary HEA NPs (PtIrFeNiCoCe) are designed and screened, showing high activity (&#951;overall = 777&#160;mV) and excellent stability (&gt;5000 cycles) at the water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Switching Memristor&#8208;Based Compute&#8208;In&#8208;Memory Module for Deep Neural Network Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory module integrated with bulk&#8208;switching memristor arrays is demonstrated. A hardware&#8211;software co&#8208;designed system is constructed to accelerate the neural network training and relax stringent requirements for device precision and endurance. The on&#8208;chip trained networks are able to reach software&#8208;comparable accuracies and exhibit robustness to weight perturbation when transferred to a new chip.








Abstract
The constant drive to achieve higher performance in deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to the proliferation of very large models. Model training, however, requires intensive computation time and energy. Memristor&#8208;based compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) modules can perform vector&#8208;matrix multiplication (VMM) in place and in parallel, and have shown great promises in DNN inference applications. However, CIM&#8208;based model training faces challenges due to non&#8208;linear weight updates, device variations, and low&#8208;precision. In this work, a mixed&#8208;precision training scheme is experimentally implemented to mitigate these effects using a bulk&#8208;switching memristor&#8208;based CIM module. Low&#8208;precision CIM modules are used to accelerate the expensive VMM operations, with high&#8208;precision weight updates accumulated in digital units. Memristor devices are only changed when the accumulated weight update value exceeds a pre&#8208;defined threshold. The proposed scheme is implemented with a system&#8208;onchip of fully integrated analog CIM modules and digital sub&#8208;systems, showing fast convergence of LeNet training to 97.73%. The efficacy of training larger models is evaluated using realistic hardware parameters and verifies that CIM modules can enable efficient mix&#8208;precision DNN training with accuracy comparable to full&#8208;precision software&#8208;trained models. Additionally, models trained on chip are inherently robust to hardware variations, allowing direct mapping to CIM inference chips without additional re&#8208;training.

         <title>Defect Driven Opto&#8208;Critical Phases Tuned for All&#8208;Solar Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>

Strategically doped Cu and oxygen vacancies introduce defect&#8208;driven opto&#8208;critical phases in WO3&#183;H2O via a one&#8208;pot, photo&#8208;induced submerged photo&#8208;synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). This innovative method fabricates uniformly dispersed, photo&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;doped WO3&#183;H2O nanocrystals, revealing an all&#8208;solar response across photothermal, photo&#8208;assisted water evaporation, and photo&#8208;electrochemical characteristics, directing future design of advanced oxide materials.








Abstract
Materials imbued with uniformly dispersed, photo&#8208;responsive nanoparticles are instrumental in sustainable energy and photonic applications. Conventional methods, however, constrain their all&#8208;solar response. An innovative alternative is proposed: submerged photo&#8208;synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). It is shown that strategic doping with copper and oxygen vacancies can induce opto&#8208;critical phases from the nonstoichiometric tungstic acids (WO3&#183;H2O). These opto&#8208;critical phases enable a dynamic equilibrium shift in lattice defect stabilization, facilitating an unprecedented a whole solar wavelength response. This response manifests as photothermal, photo&#8208;assisted water evaporation, and photo&#8208;electrochemical characteristics. Harnessing all&#8208;solar energy, this one&#8208;pot SPsC strategy may steer the design and development of advanced oxide materials, enhancing functionality across diverse application domains.

Harnessing all-solar energy, this one-pot SPsC strategy may steer the design and development of advanced oxide materials, enhancing functionality across diverse application domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Virus&#8208;Based Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of heat&#8208;induced electrical potential generation and detection of a virus is demonstrated. Bio&#8208;pyroelectricity is manifested by the unfolding of &#945;&#8208;helical protein structure and can be tuned by genetic engineering. This biopyroelectrics introduce novel opportunities to detect various viral particles and facilitate the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.








Abstract
The first observation of heat&#8208;induced electrical potential generation on a virus and its detection through pyroelectricity are presented. Specifically, the authors investigate the pyroelectric properties of the M13 phage, which possesses inherent dipole structures derived from the noncentrosymmetric arrangement of the major coat protein (pVIII) with an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation. Unidirectional polarization of the phage is achieved through genetic engineering of the tail protein (pIII) and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly techniques. By modifying the pVIII proteins with varying numbers of glutamate residues, the structure&#8208;dependent tunable pyroelectric properties of the phage are explored. The most polarized phage exhibits a pyroelectric coefficient of 0.13 &#181;C m&#8722;2 &#176;C&#8722;1. Computational modeling and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy analysis confirm that the unfolding of &#945;&#8208;helices within the pVIII proteins leads to changes in phage polarization upon heating. Moreover, the phage is genetically modified to enable its pyroelectric function in diverse chemical environments. This phage&#8208;based approach not only provides valuable insights into bio&#8208;pyroelectricity but also opens up new opportunities for the detection of various viral particles. Furthermore, it holds great potential for the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Metabolic Modulators Leads to Simultaneous Lactate Metabolism Inhibition and Intracellular Acidification for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sufficient amount of lactate transporter inhibitor (small molecule), glucose oxidase (enzyme), and O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles are simultaneously delivered to cancer cells using large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a vehicle and albumin as a carrier for small molecule. This combination synergistically induces lactate metabolism inhibition and intracellular acidification, leading to severe ATP depletion and subsequent cancer cell death.








Abstract
Simultaneous lactate metabolism inhibition and intracellular acidification (LIIA) is a promising approach for inducing tumor regression by depleting ATP. However, given the limited efficacy of individual metabolic modulators, a combination of various modulators is required for highly efficient LIIA. Herein, a co&#8208;delivery system that combines lactate transporter inhibitor, glucose oxidase, and O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles is proposed. As a vehicle, a facile room&#8208;temperature synthetic method for large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (L&#8208;MSNs) is developed. O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles are then conjugated onto L&#8208;MSNs, followed by immobilizing the lactate transporter inhibitor and glucose oxidase inside the pores of L&#8208;MSNs. To load the lactate transporter inhibitor, which is too small to be directly loaded into the large pores, it is encapsulated in albumin by controlling the albumin conformation before being loaded into L&#8208;MSNs. Notably, inhibiting lactate efflux shifts the glucose consumption mechanism from lactate metabolism to glucose oxidase reaction, which eliminates glucose and produces acid. This leads to synergistic LIIA and subsequent ATP depletion in cancer cells. Consequently, L&#8208;MSN&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery of modulators for LIIA shows high anticancer efficacy in several mouse tumor models without toxicity in normal tissues. This study provides new insights into co&#8208;delivery of small&#8208;molecule drugs, proteins, and nanoparticles for synergistic metabolic modulation in tumors.

         <title>Imaging Light&#8208;Induced Migration of Dislocations in Halide Perovskites with 3D Nanoscale Strain Mapping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites are exciting materials for optoelectronic devices. Here, synchrotron&#8208;based Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is used to visualize nanoscale strain fields and dislocation defects. By imaging these defects and strain fields in situ under continuous illumination, dramatic light&#8208;induced dislocation migration across hundreds of nanometers is uncovered, and the impact of these defects on material performance is unveiled.








Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskite materials have been used to make high&#8208;performance solar cells and light&#8208;emitting devices. However, material defects still limit device performance and stability. Here, synchrotron&#8208;based Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is used to visualize nanoscale strain fields, such as those local to defects, in halide perovskite microcrystals. Significant strain heterogeneity within MAPbBr3 (MA = CH3NH3+) crystals is found&#160;in spite of their high optoelectronic quality, and both &#12296;100&#12297; and &#12296;110&#12297; edge dislocations are identified through analysis of their local strain fields. By imaging these defects and strain fields in situ under continuous illumination, dramatic light&#8208;induced dislocation migration across hundreds of nanometers is uncovered. Further, by selectively studying crystals that are damaged by the X&#8208;ray beam, large dislocation densities and increased nanoscale strains are correlated with material degradation and substantially altered optoelectronic properties assessed using photoluminescence microscopy measurements. These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of extended defects and strain in halide perovskites, which will have important consequences for device performance and operational stability.

         <title>Mid&#8208;Infrared Bipolar and Unipolar Linear Polarization Detections in Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) broadband photodetector with bipolar and unipolar polarization ratios (PRs)&#160;is achieved using a 2D anisotropic/isotropic Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructure. Featuring a negative PR of &#8722;3.38 and a high PR of 34 for the 3.7 and 11.0&#160;&#181;m MIR light, respectively, the photodetector demonstrates promising potential in bipolar polarization encoding communications and polarization imaging.








Abstract
Detecting and distinguishing light polarization states, one of the most basic elements of optical fields, have significant importance in both scientific studies and industry applications. Artificially fabricated structures, e.g., metasurfaces with anisotropic absorptions, have shown the capabilities of detecting polarization light and controlling. However, their operations mainly rely on resonant absorptions based on structural designs that are usually narrow bands. Here, a mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) broadband polarization photodetector with high PRs and wavelength&#8208;dependent polarities using a 2D anisotropic/isotropic Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructure is demonstrated. It is shown that the photodetector exhibits high PRs of 48 and 34 at 4.6&#160; and 11.0&#160;&#181;m wavelengths, respectively, and even a negative PR of &#8722;3.38 for 3.7&#160;&#181;m under the zero bias condition at room temperature. Such interesting results can be attributed to the superimposed effects of a photovoltaic (PV) mechanism in the Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 hetero&#8208;junction region and a bolometric mechanism in the MoS2 layer. Furthermore, the photodetector demonstrates its effectiveness in bipolar and unipolar polarization encoding communications and polarization imaging enabled by its unique and high PRs.

         <title>Cooperative Rheological State&#8208;Switching of Enzymatically&#8208;Driven Composites of Circular DNA And Dextran</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of circular DNA and dextran are pushed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. Time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. Bulk state&#8208;switching is shown to arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses.








Abstract
Polymer topology, which plays a principal role in the rheology of polymeric fluids, and non&#8208;equilibrium materials, which exhibit time&#8208;varying rheological properties, are topics of intense investigation. Here, composites of circular DNA and dextran are pushed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. These time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. The gating time and lifetime of the elastic&#8208;like states, and the magnitude and sharpness of the transitions, are surprisingly decorrelated from digestion rates and non&#8208;monotonically depend on the DNA fraction. These results are modeled using sigmoidal two&#8208;state functions to show that bulk state&#8208;switching can arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses. This platform, coupling the tunability of topological composites with the power of enzymatic reactions, may be leveraged for diverse material applications from wound&#8208;healing to self&#8208;repairing infrastructure.

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured Wide&#8208;Necked Aneurysms using a Microcatheter Injectable Biomaterial</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
WNAs are challenging to treat, and when they rupture, they can lead to significant mortality. In this work, it is shown that embolization of the aneurysm sac using a gel embolic agent in combination with a flow diverter stent&#160;can safely treat non&#8208;ruptured and ruptured aneurysms in large&#8208;animal models. This combinatorial approach may best treat complex WNAs and save lives.








Abstract
Ruptured wide&#8208;neck aneurysms (WNAs), especially in a setting of coagulopathy, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is shown that by trapping a sub&#8208;millimeter clinical catheter inside the aneurysm sac using a flow diverter stent (FDS), instant hemostasis can be achieved by filling the aneurysm sac using a novel biomaterial, rescuing catastrophic bleeding in large&#8208;animal models. Multiple formulations of a biomaterial comprising gelatin, nanoclay (NC), and iohexol are developed, optimized, and extensively tested in vitro to select the lead candidate for further testing in vivo in murine, porcine, and canine models of WNAs, including in a subset with aneurysm rupture. The catheter&#8208;injectable and X&#8208;ray visible versions of the gel embolic agent (GEA) with the optimized mechanical properties outperform control groups, including a subset that receive a clinically used liquid embolic (Onyx, Medtronic), with and without aneurysm rupture. A combinatorial approach to ruptured WNAs with GEA and FDS may change the standard of medical practice and save lives.

         <title>Halide&#8208;Driven Synthetic Control of InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots Enables Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
InSb colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) show promise for extended infrared light sensing applications but face synthesis challenges due to uncontrolled reduction of precursors. Herein, the controlled growth of CQDs is achieved with well&#8208;defined excitonic transitions using zinc halide additives. The photodetectors employing ligand&#8208;exchanged CQDs achieve a 75% external quantum efficiency at 1200&#160;nm with 1&#160;V applied bias.








Abstract
In the III&#8211;V family of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) semiconductors, InSb promises access to a wider range of infrared wavelengths compared to many light&#8208;sensing material candidates. However, achieving the necessary size, size&#8208;dispersity, and optical properties has been challenging. Here the synthetic challenges associated with InSb CQDs are investigated and it is found that uncontrolled reduction of the antimony precursor hampers the controlled growth of CQDs. To overcome this, a synthetic strategy that combines nonpyrophoric precursors with zinc halide additives is developed. The experimental and computational studies show that zinc halide additives decelerate the reduction of the antimony precursor, facilitating the growth of more uniformly sized CQDs. It is also found that the halide choice provides additional control over the strength of this effect. The resultant CQDs exhibit well&#8208;defined excitonic transitions in spectral range of 1.26&#8211;0.98&#160;eV, along with strong photoluminescence. By implementing a postsynthesis ligand exchange, colloidally stable inks enabling the fabrication of high&#8208;quality CQD films are achieved. The first demonstration of InSb CQD photodetectors is presented reaching 75% external quantum efficiency (QE) at 1200&#160;nm, to the knowledge the highest short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) QE reported among heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free infrared CQD&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Outer Membrane Vesicle&#8208;Based Nanohybrids Target Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages to Enhance Trained Immunity&#8208;Related Vaccine&#8208;Generated Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outer membrane vesicle (OMV) nanohybrids, as a trained immunity&#8208;related vaccine (TIrV), induce central and peripheral trained immunity that can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring and enhance trained immunity&#8208;related vaccine&#8208;generated antitumor activity. This TIrV&#160;targets tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and induces different antitumor mechanisms with or without CD8 T cell activation in two distinct tumor models.








Abstract
Trained immunity refers to the innate immune system building memory&#8208;like features in response to subsequent infections and vaccinations. Compared with classical tumor vaccines, trained immunity&#8208;related vaccines (TIrV) are independent of tumor&#8208;specific antigens. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain an abundance of PAMPs and have the potential to act as TIrV&#8208;inducer, but face challenges in endotoxin tolerance, systemic delivery, long&#8208;term training, and trained tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;mediated antitumor phagocytosis. Here, an OMV&#8208;based TIrV is developed, OMV nanohybrids (OMV&#8208;SIRP&#945;@CaP/GM&#8208;CSF) for exerting vaccine&#8208;enhanced antitumor activity. In the bone marrow, GM&#8208;CSF&#8208;assisted OMVs train bone marrow progenitor cells and monocytes, which are inherited by TAMs. In tumor tissues, SIRP&#945;&#8208;Fc&#8208;assisted OMVs trigger TAM&#8208;mediated phagocytosis. This TIrV can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring using transposase&#8208;accessible chromatin (ATAC) and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, it is found that the TIrV&#8208;mediated antitumor mechanism in the MC38 tumor model (TAM&#8208;hot and T cell&#8208;cold) is trained immunity and activated T cell response, whereas in the B16&#8208;F10 tumor model (T cell&#8208;hot and TAM&#8208;cold) is primarily mediated by trained immunity. This study not only develops and identifies OMV&#8208;based TIrV, but also investigates the trained immunity signatures and therapeutic mechanisms, providing a basis for further vaccination strategies.

         <title>Berry Curvature Dipole Induced Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in 2D Weyl Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant mid&#8208;infrared second&#8208;harmonic generation performance (better than the visible region) is demonstrated in the newly discovered Weyl semiconductor &#8722;2D Te. Theoretical calculations reveal that it originated from the large Berry curvature dipole near the Weyl points of 2D Te. Therefore, even excited by continuous&#8208;wave laser, strong sum&#8208;frequency generation can be obtained in 2D Te.








Abstract
Due to its inversion&#8208;broken triple helix structure and the nature of Weyl semiconductor, 2D Tellurene (2D Te) is promising to possess a strong nonlinear optical response in the infrared region, which is rarely reported in 2D materials.

     alt="Berry Curvature Dipole Induced Giant Mid-Infrared Second-Harmonic Generation in 2D Weyl Semiconductor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant mid-infrared second-harmonic generation performance (better than the visible region) is demonstrated in the newly discovered Weyl semiconductor &#8722;2D Te. Theoretical calculations reveal that it originated from the large Berry curvature dipole near the Weyl points of 2D Te. Therefore, even excited by continuous-wave laser, strong sum-frequency generation can be obtained in 2D Te.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its inversion-broken triple helix structure and the nature of Weyl semiconductor, 2D Tellurene (2D Te) is promising to possess a strong nonlinear optical response in the infrared region, which is rarely reported in 2D materials. Here, a giant nonlinear infrared response induced by large Berry curvature dipole (BCD) is demonstrated in the Weyl semiconductor 2D Te. Ultrahigh second-harmonic generation response is acquired from 2D Te with a large second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (&lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;), which is up to 23.3 times higher than that of monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the range of 700&#8211;1500&#160;nm. Notably, distinct from other 2D nonlinear semiconductors, &lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; of 2D Te increases extraordinarily with increasing wavelength and reaches up to 5.58&#160;nm&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8776;2300&#160;nm, which is the best infrared performance among the reported 2D nonlinear materials. Large &lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; of 2D Te also enables the high-intensity sum-frequency generation with an ultralow continuous-wave (CW) pump power. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional performance is attributed to the presence of large BCD located at the Weyl points of 2D Te. These results unravel a new linkage between Weyl semiconductor and strong optical nonlinear responses, rendering 2D Te a competitive candidate for highly efficient nonlinear 2D semiconductors in the infrared region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Configurable MXene&#8208;Based Thermoacoustic Loudspeakers with Tunable Sound Directivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin MXene thermoacoustic loudspeakers with the capability of shape configurations provide directivity&#8208;tunable and high sound generation under different mechanical deformations. MXene conductors with low heat&#8208;capacity&#8208;per&#8208;unit&#8208;area and parylene substrates with low thermal effusivity enable bidirectional and stable sound in concave/convex, on&#8208;needle, folded, and twisted configurations. High conformability can be affixed to diverse 3D&#160;surfaces, enabling focused and omnidirectional sound generation.








Abstract
Film&#8208;type shape&#8208;configurable speakers with tunable sound directivity are in high demand for wearable electronics. Flexible, thin thermoacoustic (TA) loudspeakers&#8212;which are free from bulky vibrating diaphragms&#8212;show promise in this regard. However, configuring thin TA loudspeakers into arbitrary shapes is challenging because of their low sound pressure level (SPL) under mechanical deformations and low conformability to other surfaces. By carefully controlling the heat capacity per unit area and thermal effusivity of an MXene conductor and substrates, respectively, it fabricates an ultrathin MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeaker exhibiting high SPL output (74.5&#160;dB at 15&#160;kHz) and stable sound performance for 14 days. Loudspeakers with the parylene substrate, whose thickness is less than the thermal penetration depth, generated bidirectional and deformation&#8208;independent sound in bent, twisted, cylindrical, and stretched&#8208;kirigami configurations. Furthermore, it constructs parabolic and spherical versions of ultrathin, large&#8208;area (20&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;20&#160;cm) MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeakers, which display sound&#8208;focusing and 3D omnidirectional&#8208;sound&#8208;generating attributes, respectively.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Bright Heptamethine Dye Clusters Based on a Self&#8208;Adaptive Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy for NIR&#8208;IIb Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy, FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence which enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with ultra&#8208;high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can also occur in situ between IPA&#8208;FlavP2000/FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD).








Abstract
Despite the wide range of applications of bright NIR&#8208;II polymethine scaffolds in biomedical imaging, their solvatochromism and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effects in aqueous solutions limit their inherent brightness using traditional encapsulation methods, and effective hydrophilization strategies are still scarce. Here, a new set of Flav dyes is synthesized and PEGylated, followed by manufacturing DSPE@FlavP2000 nanoparticles using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy to overcome these limitations. FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence (&#8776;44.9% fluorescence of Flav in DMSO). DSPE@FlavP2000 enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can occur in situ between FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD), achieving consistent brightness as DSPE@FlavP2000 in blood or serum. The self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy can be enhanced by incorporating an IPA moiety, which dynamically binds to albumin to prolong the dye's blood circulation time. Thus, the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; BAD is successfully applied to long&#8208;term vascular imaging and sciatic nerve imaging. Both the self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy and BAD phenomenon improve the selectivity and availability of the hydrophilization methods, paving the way for efficient biological applications of polymethine dyes.

         <title>Microfluidic&#8208;Assembled Covalent Organic Frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene Vertical Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance electrochemical supercapacitor based on vertically structured covalent organic frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene fiber is developed via one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis. Due to vertical ion transport channels, sufficient ion&#8208;accessible area, decreased ion adsorption energy, excellent pseudocapacitive activity, and strong interfacial electron migration, the supercapacitors exhibit large capacitance, high energy density, excellent cycling stability, and wearable applications.








Abstract
The delicate design of innovative and sophisticated fibers with vertical porous skeleton and eminent electrochemical activity to generate directional ionic pathways and good faradic charge accessibility is pivotal but challenging for realizing high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Here, hierarchically ordered hybrid fiber combined vertical&#8208;aligned and conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene (VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) with interstratified electroactive covalent organic frameworks LZU1 (COF&#8208;LZU1) by one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis is developed. Due to the incorporation of vertical channels, abundant redox active sites and large accessible surface area throughout the electrode, the VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx@COF&#8208;LZU1 fibers express exceptional gravimetric capacitance of 787&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 in a three&#8208;electrode system. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state asymmetric FSCs deliver a prominent energy density of 27&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, capacitance of 398&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 and cycling life of 20&#160;000 cycles. The key to high energy storage ability originates from the decreased ions adsorption energy and ameliorative charge density distribution in vertically aligned and active hybrid fiber, accelerating ions transportation/accommodation and interfacial electrons transfer. Benefiting from excellent electrochemical performance, the FSCs offer sufficient energy supply to power watches, flags, and digital display tubes as well as be integrated with sensors to detect pulse signals, which opens a promising route for architecting advanced fiber toward the carbon neutrality market beyond energy&#8208;storage technology.

         <title>Mucosa&#8208;Inspired Electro&#8208;Responsive Lubricating Supramolecular&#8208;Covalent Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive lubricating hydrogel is developed based on the synergy of electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular non&#8208;covalent silk fibroin and covalent polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol polymer network. It demonstrates partial gel&#8208;sol transition under the electric field to regulate the lubricating property.








Abstract
Enabling the living capability of secreting liquids dynamically triggered by external stimuli while maintaining the bulk frame is a significant challenge for mucosa&#8208;inspired hydrogels. A mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed in this study using the synergy between electro&#8208;responsive silk fibroin supramolecular non&#8208;covalent networks and covalent polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol polymer networks. The formed supramolecular&#8208;covalent hydrogel exhibits a partial gel&#8208;sol transition upon the application of an electric field, and the liquid layer on the hydrogel surface near the cathode is used to mimic the mucus&#8208;secreting capability to regulate lubrication. The electro&#8208;responsive lubricating process can operate under a safe voltage and exhibits good reversibility. It is also a universal strategy to construct an electro&#8208;responsive hydrogel by introducing an electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular network into the polymer network. This mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular&#8208;covalent hydrogel offers a promising method for designing soft actuators or robots that can regulate lubrication using an electric strategy.

         <title>A 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d High Entropy Alloy as a Bifunctional Oxygen Catalyst for Robust Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noble metal&#8208;free 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d high entropy alloy, FeCoNiMoW, with high configurational entropy, subtle lattice distortions, and modulated electronic structure is an efficient bifunctional oxygen catalyst for robust aqueous, solid, and flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
High entropy alloys (HEAs) are highly suitable candidate catalysts for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR)&#160;as they offer numerous parameters for optimizing the electronic structure and catalytic sites. Herein, FeCoNiMoW HEA nanoparticles are synthesized using a solution&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature approach. Such FeCoNiMoW nanoparticles show high entropy properties, subtle lattice distortions, and modulated electronic structure, leading to superior OER performance with an overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 276&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal the electronic structures of the FeCoNiMoW active sites with an optimized d&#8208;band center position that enables suitable adsorption of OOH* intermediates and reduces the Gibbs free energy barrier in the OER process. Aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) based on this HEA demonstrate a high open circuit potential of 1.59&#160;V, a peak power density of 116.9&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, a specific capacity of 857&#160;mAh&#160;gZn&#8722;1, and excellent stability for over 660&#160;h of continuous charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Flexible and solid ZABs are also assembled and tested, displaying excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance at different bending angles. This work shows the significance of 4d/5d metal&#8208;modulated electronic structure and optimized adsorption ability to improve the performance of OER/ORR, ZABs, and beyond.

         <title>Mechanism for Generating H2O2 at Water&#8208;Solid Interface by Contact&#8208;Electrification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work shows that H2O2 can be produced from water and air through oxidoreduction processes triggered by ultrasound&#8208;driven contact&#8208;electrification at the interface of water and fluorinated ethylene propylene. The performance of the method greatly surpasses present piezocatalysis. This work proposes a clear demonstration of the mechanism and the contribution of the hydrogen bound network to the formation of H2O2.








Abstract
The recent intensification of the study of contact&#8208;electrification at water&#8208;solid interfaces and its role in physicochemical processes lead to the realization that electron transfers during water&#8208;solid contact&#8208;electrification can drive chemical reactions. This mechanism, named contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), allows chemically inert fluorinated polymers to act like single electrode electrochemical systems. This study shows hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is generated from air and deionized water, by ultrasound driven CEC, using fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) as the catalyst. For a mass ratio of catalyst to solution of 1:10000, at 20&#160;&#176;C, the kinetic rate of H2O2 evolution reaches 58.87&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows electrons are emitted in the solution by the charged FEP, during ultrasonication. EPR and isotope labelling experiments show H2O2 is formed from hydroxyl radicals (HO&#8226;) or two superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generated by CEC. Finally, it is traditionally believed such radicals migrate in the solution by Brownian diffusion prior to reactions. However, ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamic calculations reveal the radicals can react by exchanging protons and electrons through the hydrogen bonds network of water, i.e., owing to the Grotthuss mechanism. This mechanism can be relevant to other systems, artificial or natural, generating H2O2 from air and water.

         <title>Structural Diversity of Single&#8208;Walled Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanotubes Grown via Template Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy for the synthesis of inorganic nanotubes through template reactions is presented. The outer and inner walls of boron nitride nanotubes promote the coaxial growth of few&#8208;nanometers&#8208;wide chalcogenide nanotubes with diverse structures, including alloys and Janus configurations. The strategy enables the comprehensive exploration of various nanotubes, paving the way for their potential applications in optoelectronics.








Abstract
Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are an ideal 2D platform for studying a wide variety of electronic properties and potential applications due to their chemical diversity. Similarly, single&#8208;walled TMD nanotubes (SW&#8208;TMDNTs)&#8212;seamless cylinders of rolled&#8208;up TMD monolayers&#8212;are 1D materials that can exhibit tunable electronic properties depending on both their chirality and composition. However, much less has been explored about their geometrical structures and chemical variations due to their instability under ambient conditions. Here, the structural diversity of SW&#8208;TMDNTs templated by boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) is reported. The outer surfaces and inner cavities of the BNNTs promote and stabilize the coaxial growth of SW&#8208;TMDNTs with various diameters, including few&#8208;nanometers&#8208;wide species. The chiral indices (n,m) of individual SW&#8208;MoS2NTs are assigned by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and statistical analyses reveals a broad chirality distribution ranging from zigzag to armchair configurations. Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to the synthesis of various TMDNTs,&#160;such as selenides and alloyed Mo1&#8722;xWxS2. Comprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic analyses also suggest the partial formation of Janus MoS2(1&#8722;x)Se2x nanotubes. The BNNT&#8208;templated reaction provides a universal platform to characterize the chirality&#8208;dependent properties of 1D nanotubes with various electronic structures.

Flash&#8208;Thermal Shock Synthesis
In article number 2305222, Ji&#8208;Won Jung, Il&#8208;Doo Kim, Sung&#8208;Yool Choi, and co&#8208;workers report the flash&#8208;thermal shock (FTS)&#8208;driven synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers and other supports. The FTS method merits scalability (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2), rapid synthesis (&gt;1800 &#176;C within 20 ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K s&#8722;1), and ambient air processing. For their practical utility, high electrocatalytic activities are demonstrated in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions.

Virus&#8208;Based Pyroelectricity
Viruses lack the machinery to directly sense and respond to heat, but they can undergo structural adaptations in response to temperature changes. In article number 2305503, Seung&#8208;Wuk Lee and co&#8208;workers present the discovery of pyroelectric potential generation within a virus and delve into the intricate molecular mechanisms underpinning viral pyroelectricity using genetic engineering and Kelvin probe force microscopy techniques.

Treatment of Aneurysms
In article number 2305868, Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers introduce an approach to flow diverter stent&#8208;assisted treatment of wide&#8208;neck ruptured aneurysms. Following the deployment of the stent, a microcatheter is trapped with its tip in the aneurysm sac. The biomaterial is injected, casting the aneurysm and instantly achieving hemostasis. After a short period of time, the aneurysm neck is healed, preventing re&#8208;bleeding.

         <title>Optical Enhancement of Indirect Bandgap 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Multi&#8208;Functional Optoelectronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifications to improve the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides and their emerging applications in optoelectronic sensors are the focus of this review. Various engineering techniques are discussed to overcome their limitations derived from the indirect bandgap of multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as well as future directions of these materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The unique electrical and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make them attractive nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications, especially optical sensors. However, the optical characteristics of these materials are dependent on the number of layers. Monolayer TMDs have a direct bandgap that provides higher photoresponsivity compared to multilayer TMDs with an indirect bandgap. Nevertheless, multilayer TMDs are more appropriate for various photodetection applications due to their high carrier density, broad spectral response from UV to near&#8208;infrared, and ease of large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, this review focuses on the modification of the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap TMDs and their emerging applications. Several successful developments in optical devices are examined, including band structure engineering, device structure optimization, and heterostructures. Furthermore, it introduces cutting&#8208;edge techniques and future directions for optoelectronic devices based on multilayer TMDs.

         <title>Recent Advances of Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth of Metal Nanoparticles: from Growth to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 46, November 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development in seeded growth methods from key influencing factors of growth and applications of grown metal nanoparticles are summarized in this review to highlight the achievements and help researchers understand the current investigation status of seed&#8208;mediated methods. Furthermore, the challenges faced by seed&#8208;mediated methods are outlined and the future directions for advancing seed&#8208;mediated methods are outlooked.








Abstract
Unprecedented advances in metal nanoparticle synthesis have paved the way for broad applications in sensing, imaging, catalysis, diagnosis, and therapy by tuning the optical properties, enhancing catalytic performance, and improving chemical and biological properties of metal nanoparticles. The central guiding concept for regulating the size and morphology of metal nanoparticles is identified as the precise manipulation of nucleation and subsequent growth, often known as seed&#8208;mediated growth methods. However, since the growth process is sensitive not only to the metal seeds but also to capping agents, metal precursors, growth solution, growth/incubation time, reductants, and other influencing factors, the precise control of metal nanoparticle morphology is multifactorial. Further, multiple reaction parameters are entangled with each other, so it is necessary to clarify the mechanism by which each factor precisely regulates the morphology of metal nanoparticles. In this review, to exploit the generality and extendibility of metal nanoparticle synthesis, the mechanisms of growth influencing factors in seed&#8208;mediated growth methods are&#160;systematically summarized. Second, a variety of critical properties and applications enabled by grown metal nanoparticles are focused upon. Finally, the current progress and offer insights on the challenges, opportunities, and future directions for the growth and applications of grown metal nanoparticles are reviewed.

         <title>The Synthescope: A Vision for Combining Synthesis with Atomic Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts toward atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fabrication have gathered momentum. Recent results with electron&#8208;beam manipulation illustrate a significant advance toward atomic&#8208;scale patterning. In this work, the case is made that future efforts in this direction will benefit from reconceptualizing the scanning transmission electron microscope as a combined synthesis and manipulation platform, and simple strategies to incorporate synthesis processes with existing hardware are provided.








Abstract
The scanning transmission electron microscope, a workhorse instrument in materials characterization, is being transformed into an atomic&#8208;scale material&#8208;manipulation platform. With an eye on the trajectory of recent developments and the obstacles toward progress in this field, a vision for a path toward an expanded set of capabilities and applications is provided. The microscope is reconceptualized as an instrument for fabrication and synthesis with the capability to image and characterize atomic&#8208;scale structural formation as it occurs. Further development and refinement of this approach may have substantial impact on research in microelectronics, quantum information science, and catalysis, where precise control over atomic&#8208;scale structure and chemistry of a few &#8220;active sites&#8221; can have a dramatic impact on larger&#8208;scale functionality and where developing a better understanding of atomic&#8208;scale processes can help point the way to larger&#8208;scale synthesis approaches.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II&#160;Fluorophore with Inverted Dependence of Fluorescence Quantum Yield on Polarity as Potent Phototheranostics for Fluorescence&#8208;Image&#8208;Guided Phototherapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorophore AS1 with inverted dependence of fluorescence quantum yield on polarity is used to construct potent phototheranostics (AS1R) for clear delineation and complete elimination of tumors by phototherapy with an ultralow injection dose. Compared with other types of organic phototheranostics, AS1R exhibits better phototheranostic performance in brightness, photothermal effect, and photodynamic performance at the same mass concentration.








Abstract
Organic phototheranostics simultaneously having fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) window, and photothermal and photodynamic functions possess great prospects in tumor diagnosis and therapy. However, such phototheranostics generally suffer from low brightness and poor photodynamic performance due to severe solvatochromism. Herein, an organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore AS1, which possesses an inverted dependence of fluorescence quantum yield on polarity, is reported to serve as potent phototheranostics for tumor diagnosis and therapy. After encapsulation of AS1 into nanostructures, the obtained phototheranostics (AS1R) exhibit high extinction coefficients (e.g., 68200&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 808&#160;nm), NIR&#8208;II emission with high fluorescence quantum yield up to 4.7% beyond 1000 nm, photothermal conversion efficiency of &#8776;65%, and 1O2 quantum yield up to 4.1%. The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that AS1R is superior to other types of organic phototheranostics in brightness, photothermal effect, and photodynamic performance at the same mass concentration. The excellent phototheranostic performance of AS1R enables clear visualization and complete elimination of tumors using a single and low injection dose. This study demonstrates the merits and prospects of NIR&#8208;II fluorophore with inverted polarity dependence of fluorescence quantum yield as high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents for fluorescence imaging and phototherapy of tumors.

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adaptive Polymers Trigger Fission of Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobicity&#8208;adaptive polymers based on poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) are anchored to tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived microparticles (MPs) for enhanced delivery of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The hydrophobicity of polymers at the tumor acidic microenvironment drives the fission of MPs to form small vesicles, facilitating tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration, and efficient internalization of DOX@MPs into tumor cells and cancer stem cells.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived microparticles (MPs) can function as anticancer drug&#8208;delivery carriers. However, short blood circulation time, large&#8208;size&#8208;induced insufficient tumor accumulation and penetration into tumor parenchyma, as well as limited cellular internalization by tumor cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), and difficult intracellular drug release restrict the anticancer activity of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MP&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery systems. In this work, hydrophobicity&#8208;adaptive polymers based on poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) are anchored to tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs for enhanced delivery of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The polymers are hydrophilic in blood to prolong the circulation time of DOX&#8208;loaded MPs (DOX@MPs), while rapidly switching to hydrophobic at the tumor acidic microenvironment. The hydrophobicity of polymers drives the fission of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs to form small vesicles, facilitating tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration, and efficient internalization of DOX@MPs into tumor cells and CSCs. Subsequently, the hydrophobicity of polymers in acidic lysosomes further promotes DOX release to nuclei for strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells and CSCs. The work provides a facile and simple strategy for improved anticancer drug delivery of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs.

         <title>Ultrastrong Ionotronic Films Showing Electrochemical Osmotic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastrong nanocomposite is introduced, which is formed based on the two nanoscopic building blocks: large&#8208;size 2D MXene and 1D nanocellulose with very high aspect ratio. In the wet state, the hierarchical structures of the nanocomposite provide high ionotronic conductivity and enable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane actuation with reversible giant strain reaching 85% at only 1 V.








Abstract
A multifunctional soft material with high ionic and electrical conductivity, combined with high mechanical properties and the ability to change shape can enable bioinspired responsive devices and systems. The incorporation of all these characteristics in a single material is very challenging, as the improvement of one property tends to reduce other properties. Here, a nanocomposite film based on charged, high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 1D flexible nanocellulose fibrils, and 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is presented. The self&#8208;assembly process results in a stratified structure with the nanoparticles aligned in&#8208;plane, providing high ionotronic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as large water uptake. In hydrogel form with 20&#160;wt% liquid, the electrical conductivity is over 200 S cm&#8722;1 and the in&#8208;plane tensile strength is close to 100&#160;MPa. This multifunctional performance results from the uniquely layered composite structure at nano&#8208; and mesoscales. A new type of electrical soft actuator is assembled where voltage as low as &#177;1&#160;V resulted in osmotic effects and giant reversible out&#8208;of&#8208;plane swelling, reaching 85% strain.

         <title>Bimodal Gating Mechanism in Hybrid Thin&#8208;Film Transistors Based on Dynamically Reconfigurable Nanoscale Biopolymer Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to control the deposition of nanoscale layers of silk on semiconductors allows transistors that can controllably operate either in the ionic or dielectric regime to be built. These devices can be produced at scale and allow for a class of hybrid, (bio)functional devices where semiconductors and natural materials coexist, reducing the gap between biology and technology even further.








Abstract
In recent years, increased control over naturally derived structural protein formulations and their self&#8208;assembly has enabled the application of high&#8208;resolution manufacturing techniques to silk&#8208;based materials, leading to bioactive interfaces with unprecedented miniaturized formats and functionalities. Here, a hybrid biopolymer&#8211;semiconductor device, obtained by integrating nanoscale silk layers in a well&#8208;established class of inorganic field&#8208;effect transistors (silk&#8208;FETs), is presented. The devices offer two distinct modes of operation&#8212;either traditional field&#8208;effect or electrolyte&#8208;gated&#8212;enabled by the precisely controlled thickness, morphology, and biochemistry of the integrated silk layers. The different operational modes are selectively accessed by dynamically modulating the free&#8208;water content within the nanoscale protein layer from the vapor phase. The utility of these hybrid devices is illustrated in a highly sensitive and ultrafast breath sensor, highlighting the opportunities offered by the integration of nanoscale biomaterial interfaces in conjunction with traditional semiconductor devices, enabling functional outcomes at the intersection between the worlds of microelectronics and biology.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Programmed Stem Cell Niches via Orthogonal Extracellular Vesicle&#8211;Cell Communications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded ligand&#8211;receptor system (DLRS) is developed to program orthogonal interkingdom EV&#8211;cell communications in complex environments. This system enables a DNA&#8208;programmed stem cell niche for stemness maintenance and self&#8208;renewal of female germline stem cells (FGSCs) without the need for living feeder cells.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural carriers for intercellular transfer of bioactive molecules, which are harnessed for wide biomedical applications. However, a facile yet general approach to engineering interspecies EV&#8211;cell communications is still lacking. Here, the use of DNA to encode the heterogeneous interfaces of EVs and cells in a manner free of covalent or genetic modifications is reported, which enables orthogonal EV&#8211;cell interkingdom interactions in complex environments. Cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands and tetrahedral DNA frameworks are employed with complementary sequences to serve as artificial ligands and receptors docking on EVs and living cells, respectively, which can mediate specific yet efficient cellular internalization of EVs via Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. It is shown that based on this system, human cells can adopt EVs derived from the mouse, watermelon, and Escherichia coli. By implementing several EV&#8211;cell circuits, it shows that this DNA&#8208;programmed system allows orthogonal EV&#8211;cell communications in complex environments. This study further demonstrates efficient delivery of EVs with bioactive contents derived from feeder cells toward monkey female germline stem cells (FGSCs), which enables self&#8208;renewal and stemness maintenance of the FGSCs without feeder cells. This system may provide a universal platform to customize intercellular exchanges of materials and signals across species and kingdoms.

         <title>Giant Energy Density via Mechanically Tailored Relaxor Ferroelectric Behavior of PZT Thick Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanograin engineering of normal ferroelectrics beyond compositional modification, to simultaneously enhance the dielectric breakdown strength and polarization with slim hysteresis which is typical behavior of relaxor ferroelectrics (RFE), a facile approach, is designed and revealed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage devices. The mechanically transformed RFE thick film (&#8776;4&#160;&#181;m) delivers a record&#8208;high energy density of 124&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Relaxor ferroelectrics (RFEs) are being actively investigated for energy&#8208;storage applications due to their large electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced polarization with slim hysteresis and fast energy charging&#8211;discharging capability. Here, a novel nanograin engineering approach based upon high kinetic energy deposition is reported, for mechanically inducing the RFE behavior in a normal ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT), which results in simultaneous enhancement in the dielectric breakdown strength (EDBS) and polarization. Mechanically transformed relaxor thick films with 4&#160;&#181;m thickness exhibit an exceptional EDBS of 540&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and reduced hysteresis with large unsaturated polarization (103.6&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2), resulting in a record high energy&#8208;storage density of 124.1&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a power density of 64.5&#160;MW&#160;cm&#8722;3. This fundamental advancement is correlated with the generalized nanostructure design that comprises nanocrystalline phases embedded within the amorphous matrix. Microstructure&#8208;tailored ferroelectric behavior overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional compositional design methods and provides a feasible pathway for realization of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Scissoring Perfluoroarenes Trigger Photomultiplication in Full Color Organic Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent networks consisting of photo&#8208;crosslinked polymer donor:perfluoroarene exhibit exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, leading to high EQE photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes together with enhanced stability and fine photo&#8208;patternability, without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. This mechanism is enabled by interfacial energy band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor, as confirmed by photophysical analyses.








Abstract
An unprecedented but useful functionality of perfluoroarenes to enable exciton scissoring in photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (PM&#8208;OPDs) is reported. Perfluoroarenes that are covalently connected to polymer donors via a photochemical reaction enable the demonstration of high external quantum efficiency and B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPDs without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. The operation mechanism of the suggested perfluoroarene&#8208;driven PM&#8208;OPDs, how covalently bonded polymer donor:perfluoroarene PM&#8208;OPDs can perform as effectively as polymer donor:fullerene blend&#8208;based PM&#8208;OPDs, is investigated. By employing a series of arenes and conducting steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy analyses, it is found that interfacial band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor is responsible for exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, which induces photomultiplication. Owing to the acceptor&#8208;free and covalently interconnected photoactive layer in the suggested PM&#8208;OPDs, superior operational and thermal stabilities are observed. Finally, finely patterned B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPD arrays that enable the construction of highly sensitive passive matrix&#8208;type organic image sensors are demonstrated.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Ferromagnetic Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Programmed Dual&#8208;Anisotropy and Multi&#8208;Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic liquid crystal elastomer (magLCE) ink whose nematic order and magnetization can be independently programmed to be anisotropic via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform is reported. The 3D&#8208;printed magLCE provides designable multimodal shape morphing under different stimuli, which is promising for wireless soft robots and intelligent devices.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and magnetic soft materials are promising active materials in many emerging fields, such as soft robotics. Despite the high demand for developing active materials that combine the advantages of LCE and magnetic actuation, the lack of independent programming of the LCE nematic order and magnetization in a single material still hinders the desired multi&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization is developed that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as &#8220;dual anisotropy&#8221;, via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform. The magLCE ink is fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic microparticles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D&#8208;printing platform is created by integrating a magnet with 3&#8208;DoF motion into an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo&#8208;heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. A programmed magLCE strip robot is demonstrated with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi&#8208;actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multistable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Hydrogels with Electrotunable Permeability and Uniaxial Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. This work demonstrates how the swelling of hydrogels from cellulose nanofibrils and carbon nanotubes can be electrochemically controlled to achieve electrochemical osmotic actuation. This new materials system paves the way for integrated actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation in electrotunable separation membranes or soft actuators.








Abstract
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. However, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels still suffer from limited actuation control. Direct electronic control of electronically conductive hydrogels can solve this challenge and allow direct integration with modern electronic systems. An electrochemically controlled nanowire composite hydrogel with high in&#8208;plane conductivity that stimulates a uniaxial electrochemical osmotic expansion is demonstrated. This materials system allows precisely controlled shape&#8208;morphing at only &#8722;1&#160;V, where capacitive charging of the hydrogel bulk leads to a large uniaxial expansion of up to 300%, caused by the ingress of &#8776;700 water molecules per electron&#8211;ion pair. The material retains its state when turned off, which is ideal for electrotunable membranes as the inherent coupling between the expansion and mesoporosity enables electronic control of permeability for adaptive separation, fractionation, and distribution. Used as electrochemical osmotic hydrogel actuators, they achieve an electroactive pressure of up to 0.7&#160;MPa (1.4&#160;MPa vs dry) and a work density of &#8776;150&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3 (2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3&#160;vs dry). This new materials system paves the way to integrate actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation into advanced soft intelligent systems.

&lt;p&gt;The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life-like soft intelligent systems. This work demonstrates how the swelling of hydrogels from cellulose nanofibrils and carbon nanotubes can be electrochemically controlled to achieve electrochemical osmotic actuation. This new materials system paves the way for integrated actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation in electrotunable separation membranes or soft actuators.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life-like soft intelligent systems. However, stimuli-responsive hydrogels still suffer from limited actuation control. Direct electronic control of electronically conductive hydrogels can solve this challenge and allow direct integration with modern electronic systems. An electrochemically controlled nanowire composite hydrogel with high in-plane conductivity that stimulates a uniaxial electrochemical osmotic expansion is demonstrated. This materials system allows precisely controlled shape-morphing at only &#8722;1&#160;V, where capacitive charging of the hydrogel bulk leads to a large uniaxial expansion of up to 300%, caused by the ingress of &#8776;700 water molecules per electron&#8211;ion pair.

         <title>A Spidroin&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical&#8208;Structure Binder Achieves Highly Integrated Silicon&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous&#8211;oil binary solution&#8208;based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin&#8208;like hierarchical structure for tolerating huge volume change of silicon&#8208;based electrodes is reported. The AOB binder enables both high tensile strength and elasticity, and strong electrode adhesion, therefore apparently stabilizing the silicon&#8208;based electrode structure and rendering prolonged electrode cycle life.








Abstract
As a promising component for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, silicon&#8208;based electrodes have attracted increasing attention by virtue of their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacities. Nevertheless, fast capacity fading posed by tremendous silicon&#8208;based electrode volume changes during cycling remains a huge challenge before large&#8208;scale applications. In this work, an aqueous&#8211;oil binary solution based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin&#8208;like hierarchical structure for tolerating the huge volume changes of silicon&#8208;based electrodes is developed. In the AOB binder, the polymer, containing hydrophobic tetrazole groups, denoted as PPB, and the water&#8208;soluble amorphous poly(acrylic acid), mimick the &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix structure of spidroin, respectively. Benefitting from such biomimetic design, the AOB binder enables both high tensile strength and elasticity, and strong electrode adhesion, therefore apparently stabilizing the silicon&#8208;based electrode structure and rendering prolonged electrode cycle life. Such a strategy endows 3.3 Ah soft package cells assembled with Si/C composite anode and NCM811 cathode with a discharge specific capacity of 2.92 Ah after 700 cycles. This work marks a milestone in developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicon&#8208;based electrodes toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;battery applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Intelligent Wearable Devices Using Logical Circuits of Monolithic Gold Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional intelligent wearable devices are developed using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. The monolithically patterned gold nanowires enable robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on&#8208;demand heating systems, and strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. The multifunctional intelligent wearable devices can sensitively monitor strain and temperature changes with the heating system for various biomedical applications.








Abstract
Although multifunctional wearable devices have been widely investigated for healthcare systems, augmented/virtual realities, and telemedicines, there are few reports on multiple signal monitoring and logical signal processing by using one single nanomaterial without additional algorithms or rigid application&#8208;specific integrated circuit chips. Here, multifunctional intelligent wearable devices are developed using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. Gold bulk&#160;and hollow nanowires&#160;show distinctive electrical properties with high chemical stability and high stretchability. In accordance, the monolithically patterned gold nanowires can be used to fabricate the robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on&#8208;demand heating systems, and strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. The stretchable sensors show high sensitivity for strain and temperature changes on the skin. Furthermore, the micro&#8208;wrinkle structures of gold nanowires exhibit the negative gauge factor, which can be used for strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. Taken together, this multifunctional intelligent wearable device would be harnessed as a promising platform for futuristic electronic and biomedical applications.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Additive&#8208;Assisted Tellurium Homogenization in ZnSeTe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dependence on aqueous hydrohalic acids poses challenges when working with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors, as seen in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe quantum dots. In this work, a safe and oxygen&#8208;free method is proposed to introduce anhydrous acids into the synthesis using benzenecarbonyl fluoride as a chemical additive. This method enables a controlled release of acid, resulting in a more uniform Te distribution within the ZnSeTe lattice.








Abstract
Addition of aqueous hydrohalic acids during the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is widely employed to achieve high&#8208;quality QDs. However, this reliance on the use of aqueous solutions is incompatible with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors such as those used in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe QDs. Herein, it is shown that this incompatibility leads to phase segregation into Te&#8208;rich and Te&#8208;poor regions, causing spectral broadening and luminescence peak shifting under high laser irradiation and applied electrical bias. Here, a synthetic strategy to produce anhydrous&#8208;HF in situ by using benzenecarbonyl fluoride (BF) as a chemical additive is reported. Through in situ 19F NMR spectroscopy, it is found that BF reacts with surfactants in tandem, ultimately producing intermediary F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;trioctylamine adducts. These act as a pseudo&#8208;HF source that releases anhydrous HF. The controlled release of HF during nucleation and growth steps homogenizes Te distribution in ZnSeTe lattice, leading to spectrally stable blue&#8208;emitting QDs under increasing laser flux from &#8776;3 &#181;W to &#8776;12 mW and applied bias from 2.6 to 10 V. Single&#8208;dot photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and analyses of the absorption, PL and transient absorption spectra together with density functional theory point to the role of anhydrous HF as a Te homogenizer.

         <title>Oriented Perovskite Film from Laser Recrystallization in Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;MAPLA&#8221; employs magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted pulse laser annealing to control perovskite crystal orientation on substrates, enhancing crystal size, orientation, and stability. Magnetic nanoparticles guide orientational gathering into nanoclusters. Device performance improves with responsivity and detectivity increasing two times, and photocurrent three orders higher than pulsed laser annealing. MAPLA enhances stability by preventing Pb2+ reduction, making MAPLA promising for stable electro&#8208;optical thin films.








Abstract
The orientation of crystals on the substrate and the presence of defects are critical factors in electro&#8208;optic performance. However, technical approaches to guide the orientational crystallization of electro&#8208;optical thin films remain challenging. Here,&#160;a novel physical method called magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted pulse laser annealing (MAPLA) for controlling the orientation of perovskite crystals on substrates is reported. By inducing laser recrystallization of perovskite crystals under a magnetic field and with magnetic nanoparticles, the optical and magnetic fields are found to guide the orientational gathering of perovskite units into nanoclusters, resulting in perovskite crystals with preferred lattice orientation in (110) and (220) perpendicular to the substrate. The perovskite crystals obtained by MAPLA exhibit significantly larger grain size and fewer defects compared to those from pulsed laser annealing (PLA) and traditional thermal annealing, resulting in improved carrier lifetime and mobility. Furthermore, MAPLA demonstrates enhanced device performance, increasing responsivity and detectivity by two times, and photocurrent by nearly three orders compared with PLA. The introduction of Fe2O3 nanoparticles during MAPLA not only improves crystal size and orientation but also significantly enhances long&#8208;term stability by preventing Pb2+ reduction. The MAPLA method has great potential for fabricating many electro&#8208;optical thin films with desired device properties and stability.

Furthermore, MAPLA demonstrates enhanced device performance, increasing responsivity and detectivity by two times, and photocurrent by nearly three orders compared with PLA. The introduction of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles during MAPLA not only improves crystal size and orientation but also significantly enhances long-term stability by preventing Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. The MAPLA method has great potential for fabricating many electro-optical thin films with desired device properties and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Bright Organic Radical Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous achievement of high efficiency (&gt;17%) and radiance (&gt;1.0 &#215; 105 mW sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2) for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is demonstrated based on doublet fluorescence with the combination of a bipolar host and a novel organic radical. Photophysical studies and device characterization support the substantial enhancement of device performance for doublet electroluminescence.








Abstract
Organic radicals have been of interest due to their potential to replace nonradical&#8208;based organic emitters, especially for deep&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electroluminescence (EL), based on the spin&#8208;allowed doublet fluorescence. However, the performance of the radical&#8208;based EL devices is limited by low carrier mobility which causes a large efficiency roll&#8208;off at high current densities. Here, highly efficient and bright doublet EL devices are reported by combining a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host that supports both electron and hole transport and a tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl&#8208;based radical emitter. Steady&#8208;state and transient photophysical studies reveal the optical signatures of doublet luminescence mechanisms arising from both host and guest photoexcitation. The host system presented here allows balanced hole and electron currents, and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.4% at 707&#160;nm peak emission with substantially improved efficiency roll&#8208;off is reported: over 70% of the maximum EQE (12.2%) is recorded at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and even at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, nearly 50% of the maximum EQE (8.4%) is maintained. This is an important step in the practical application of organic radicals to NIR light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Confining Prepared Ultrasmall Nanozymes Loading ATO for Lung Cancer Catalytic Therapy/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall nPt nanozymes are innovatively fabricated upon AuP via a SiO2 spatial confinement strategy, and then modified with human serum albumin, followed by loading&#160;atovaquone molecules, and encapsulating IR780 in succession, to design AP&#8208;HAI probes in which the IR780's PDT property and the nPt nanozymes' photoenhanced peroxidase&#8208;like ability endow probes with a high reactive oxygen species (ROS) productivity, which results in outstanding lung&#8208;cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/immunogenic&#8208;cell&#8208;death&#8208;based immunotherapy.








Abstract
Nanozymes with inherent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic properties combat malignant tumor progression via catalytic therapy, while the therapeutic efficacy still needs to be improved. In this work, ultrasmall platinum nanozymes (nPt) in a confined domain of a wormlike pore channel in gold nanobipyramidal&#8211;mesoporous silica dioxide nanocomposites, producing nanozyme carriers AP&#8208;mSi with photoenhanced peroxidase ability, are innovatively synthesized. Afterward, based on the prepared AP&#8208;mSi, a lung&#8208;cancer nanozymes probe (AP&#8208;HAI) is ingeniously produced by removing the SiO2 template, modifying human serum albumin, and loading atovaquone molecules (ATO) as well as IR780. Under NIR light irradiation, inner AuP and IR780 collaborate for photothermal process, thus facilitating the peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic process of H2O2. Additionally, loaded ATO, a cell respiration inhibitor, can impair tumor respiration metabolism and cause oxygen retention, hence enhancing IR780's photodynamic therapy (PDT) effectiveness. As a result, IR780's PDT and nPt nanozymes' photoenhanced peroxidase&#8208;like ability endow probes a high ROS productivity, eliciting antitumor immune responses to destroy tumor tissue. Systematic studies reveal that the obvious reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is obtained by the strategy of using nPt nanozymes and reducing oxygen consumption by ATO, which in turn enables lung&#8208;cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/immunogenic&#8208;cell&#8208;death&#8208;based immunotherapy. The results of this work would provide theoretical justification for the practical use of photoenhanced nanozyme probes.

         <title>Carrageenan as a Sacrificial Binder for 5&#160;V LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#955;&#8208;Carrageenan (CRN) is introduced as a &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder to produce a desired LiSOxF&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase on 5 V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 from its innate sulfate functionality. CRN also protects the cathode surface from indiscriminate side reactions by its uniform coverage involving hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interaction, thereby catching two challenging rabbits of stable cyclability and high&#8208;rate performance simultaneously.








Abstract
5&#160;V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) with its spinel symmetry is a promising cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high&#8208;voltage operation of LNMO renders it vulnerable to interfacial degradation involving electrolyte decomposition, which hinders long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. Herein, this longstanding challenge presented by LNMO is overcome by incorporating a sacrificial binder, namely, &#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CRN), a sulfated polysaccharide. This binder not only uniformly covers the LNMO surface via hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interaction but also offers an ionically conductive cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer containing LiSOxF, a product of the electrochemical decomposition of the sulfate group. Taking advantage of these two auspicious properties, the CRN&#8208;based electrode exhibits cycling and rate performance far superior to that of its counterparts based on the conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) and sodium alginate binders. This study introduces a new concept, namely &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder, for battery electrodes known to deliver superior electrochemical performance but be adversely affected by interfacial instability.

         <title>An In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembled Bispecific Nanoblocker for Enhancing Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;based bispecific nanoblocker strategy is developed for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells, which enables boosted T&#8208;cells infiltration by CXCR4 blockage and enhanced T&#8208;cells activation by PD&#8208;L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high&#8208;performance tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody has achieved substantial success in tumor immunotherapy by T&#8208;cells activation. However, the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components induced by unsatisfactory T&#8208;cells infiltration and poor tumor penetration of antibodies make it challenging to realize efficient tumor immunotherapy. Herein, a peptide&#8208;based bispecific nanoblocker (BNB) strategy is reported for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells that are capable of boosting T&#8208;cells infiltration through CXCR4 blockage and enhancing T&#8208;cells activation by PD&#8208;L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high&#8208;performance tumor immunotherapy. Briefly, the BNB strategy selectively recognizes and bonds CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 with deep tumor penetration, which rapidly self&#8208;assembles into nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells. Compared to the traditional bispecific antibody, BNB exhibits an intriguing metabolic behavior, that is, the elimination half&#8208;life (t1/2) of BNB in the tumor is 69.3&#160;h which is &#8776;50 times longer than that in the plasma (1.4&#160;h). The higher tumor accumulation and rapid systemic clearance overcome potential systemic side effects. Moreover, the solid tumor stress generated by excessive extracellular matrix components is substantially reduced to 44%, which promotes T&#8208;cells infiltration and activation for immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, these findings substantially strengthen and extend clinical applications of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Cation&#8211;&#960;&#160;Interactions Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Bright, and Spectrally Stable Rec. 2020 Pure&#8208;Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;size aromatic amino acid of tryptophan (TRP), featuring strong cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, is introduced to "clean" the imperfect surface sites of the CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs). The as&#8208;formed TRP&#8208;NCs demonstrate increased luminescence efficiency and obviously enhanced spectral stability, which enables the achievement of Rec.2020 pure&#8208;red perovskite&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibiting high external quantum efficiency along with superior brightness and spectral stability.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with pure&#8208;red electroluminescence for practical applications remains a critical challenge because of the problematic luminescence property and spectral instability of existing emitters. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs, simultaneously exhibiting exceptional brightness and spectral stability, based on CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) capping with aromatic amino acid ligands featuring cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, are reported. It is proven that strong cation&#8211;&#960; interactions between the PbI6&#8208;octahedra of perovskite units and the electron&#8208;rich indole ring of tryptophan (TRP) molecules not only chemically polish the imperfect surface sites, but also markedly increase the binding affinity of the ligand molecules, leading to high photoluminescence quantum yields and greatly enhanced spectral stability of the CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs. Moreover, the incorporation of small&#8208;size aromatic TRP ligands ensures superior charge&#8208;transport properties of the assembled emissive layers. The resultant devices emitting at around 635&#160;nm demonstrate a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.8%, a max luminance of 12&#8239;910&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and outstanding spectral stability, representing one of the best&#8208;performing Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs achieved so far.

         <title>Boosting the Electrochemical 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation by Balancing the Competitive Adsorption of Organic and OH&#8722; over Controllable Reconstructed Ni3S2/NiOx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n with continuously controllable surface compositions is synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of 5&#8208;hyfroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibits excellent performance inHMF electrooxidation, with a current density of 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;V and selectivity of &gt;98% for the 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising method for the efficient production of biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. However, its practical application is limited by: 1) the low activity and selectivity caused by the competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722; and 2) the low operational stability caused by the uncontrollable reconstruction of the catalyst. To overcome these limitations, a series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n catalysts with controllable compositions and well&#8208;defined structures are synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. The adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722; can be continuously adjusted by varying the ratio of NiOx to Ni3S2 on the catalysts surface, as indicated by in situ characterizations, contact angle analysis,&#160;and theoretical simulations. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibited remarkable HMF electrocatalytic oxidation performance, with the current density reaching 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;VRHE and the Faradaic efficiency of the product, 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid, reaching 98%. Moreover, Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 exhibits excellent durability, with its activity and structure remaining stable for over 100&#160;h of operation. This study provides a new route for the design and construction of catalysts for value&#8208;added biomass conversion and offers new insights into enhancing catalytic performance by balancing competitive adsorption.

         <title>A Mitochondrion&#8208;Inspired Magnesium&#8211;Oxygen Biobattery with High Energy Density In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery with a double&#8208;membrane structure, inspired by the mitochondrion, is presented. The biobattery exhibits an unprecedented volumetric energy density of 2517 Wh&#160;L&#8211;1 based on the overall volume of the device in vivo. It also shows excellent biocompatibility, with high device/tissue affinity.








Abstract
Implantable batteries are urgently needed as a power source to meet the demands of the next generation of biomedical electronic devices. However, existing implantable batteries suffer from unsatisfactory energy density, hindering the miniaturization of these devices. Here, a mitochondrion&#8208;inspired magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery that achieves both high energy density and biocompatibility in vivo is reported. The resulting biobattery exhibits a recorded energy density of 2517 Wh&#160;L&#8211;1/1491 Wh&#160;kg&#8211;1 based on the total volume/mass of the device in vivo, which is &#8776;2.5 times higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, and can adapt to different environments for stable discharges. The volume of the magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery can be as thin as 0.015 mm3 and can be scaled up to 400 times larger without reducing the energy density. Additionally, it shows a stable biobattery/tissue interface, significantly reducing foreign body reactions. This work presents an effective strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance implantable batteries.

         <title>Rational Design of a Chemical Bath Deposition Based Tin Oxide Electron&#8208;Transport Layer for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tin oxide electron&#8208;transport layer for perovskite solar cells is developed via chemical bath deposition. Oxalic acid, a volatile dicarboxylic acid ligand, functions as a chemical linker to facilitate film deposition and can be readily removed by thermal annealing and a mild H2O2 treatment. The result is an efficient (24.6%) and stable (T85 = 1500&#160;h) perovskite solar cell.








Abstract
Chemical bath deposition (CBD) is widely used to deposit tin oxide (SnOx) as an electron&#8208;transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The conventional recipe uses thioglycolic acid (TGA) to facilitate attachments of SnOx particles onto the substrate. However, nonvolatile TGA is reported to harm the operational stability of PSCs. In this work, a volatile oxalic acid (OA) is introduced as an alternative to TGA. OA, a dicarboxylic acid, functions as a chemical linker for the nucleation and attachment of particles to the substrate in the chemical bath. Moreover, OA can be readily removed through thermal annealing followed by a mild H2O2 treatment, as shown by FTIR measurements. Synergistically, the mild H2O2 treatment selectively oxidizes the surface of the SnOx layer, minimizing nonradiative interface carrier recombination. EELS (electron&#8208;energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy) confirms that the SnOx surface is dominated by Sn4+, while the bulk is a mixture of Sn2+ and Sn4+. This rational design of a CBD SnOx layer leads to devices with T85 &#8776;1500&#160;h, a significant improvement over the TGA&#8208;based device with T80 &#8776;250&#160;h. The champion device reached a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%. This work offers a rationale for optimizing the complex parameter space of CBD SnOx to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;A novel tin oxide electron-transport layer for perovskite solar cells is developed via chemical bath deposition. Oxalic acid, a volatile dicarboxylic acid ligand, functions as a chemical linker to facilitate film deposition and can be readily removed by thermal annealing and a mild H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment. The result is an efficient (24.6%) and stable (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;85&lt;/sub&gt; = 1500&#160;h) perovskite solar cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical bath deposition (CBD) is widely used to deposit tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) as an electron-transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The conventional recipe uses thioglycolic acid (TGA) to facilitate attachments of SnO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; particles onto the substrate. However, nonvolatile TGA is reported to harm the operational stability of PSCs. In this work, a volatile oxalic acid (OA) is introduced as an alternative to TGA. OA, a dicarboxylic acid, functions as a chemical linker for the nucleation and attachment of particles to the substrate in the chemical bath. Moreover, OA can be readily removed through thermal annealing followed by a mild H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment, as shown by FTIR measurements. Synergistically, the mild H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment selectively oxidizes the surface of the SnO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; layer, minimizing nonradiative interface carrier recombination. EELS (electron-energy-loss spectroscopy) confirms that the SnO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; surface is dominated by Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, while the bulk is a mixture of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. This rational design of a CBD SnO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; layer leads to devices with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;85&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776;1500&#160;h, a significant improvement over the TGA-based device with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776;250&#160;h. The champion device reached a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%. This work offers a rationale for optimizing the complex parameter space of CBD SnO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fruit&#8208;Derived Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Engineered Structural Droplet Drugs for Enhanced Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fruit&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs (ESDDs) exhibit excellent stability and flexibility, enabling them to highly efficiently cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB) and deeply penetrate into glioblastoma tissues by deformation&#8208;amplified endocytosis and membrane fusion. As expected, the ESDDs present more efficient capacities than cRGD&#8208;modified EVs (REs) in accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization, significantly enhancing the anti&#8208;glioblastoma efficacy.








Abstract
Existing solid&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based drug delivery systems remain a great challenge for glioblastoma chemotherapy due to their poor capacities in crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Herein, fruit&#8208;derived extracellular&#8208;vesicle (EV)&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs (ESDDs) are demonstrated by programming the self&#8208;assembly of fruit&#8208;derived EVs at the DOX@squalene&#8211;PBS interface, greatly enhancing the antitumor efficacy against glioblastoma. The ESDDs experience a flexible delivery via deformation&#8208;amplified macropinocytosis and membrane fusion, enabling them to highly efficiently cross the BBB/BBTB and deeply penetrate glioblastoma tissues. As expected, the ESDDs exhibit approximately 2.5&#8208;fold intracellular uptake, 2.2&#8208;fold transcytosis, and fivefold membrane fusion higher than cRGD&#8208;modified EVs (REs), allowing highly efficient accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into the glioblastoma tissues, and thereby significantly extending the survival time of glioblastoma mice.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Generated Electron&#8208;Blocking LiH Enabling an Unprecedented Critical Current Density of Over 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for Solid&#8208;State Hydride Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial dehydrogenation strategy in situ generates an electronic blocking dispersed LiH layer on the particle surfaces of LiBH4&#8208;based electrolyte to realize excellent dendrite suppression capability, expended voltage window, and broadened operational temperature, which extend their applicability in highly safe and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high&#8208;energy density in power&#8208; or energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
LiBH4 is a promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SE) due to its thermodynamic stability to Li. However, poor Li&#8208;ion conductivities at room temperature, low oxidative stabilities, and severe dendrite growth hamper its application. In this work, a partial dehydrogenation strategy is adopted to in situ generate an electronic blocking layer dispersed of LiH, addressing the above three issues simultaneously. The electrically insulated LiH reduces the electronic conductivity by two orders of magnitude, leading to a 32.0&#8208;times higher critical electrical bias for dendrite growth on the particle surfaces than that of the counterpart. Additionally, this layer not only promotes the Li&#8208;ion conductance by stimulating coordinated rotations of BH4&#8722; and B12H122&#8722;, contributing to a Li&#8208;ion conductivity of 1.38 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also greatly enhances oxidation stability by localizing the electron density on BH4&#8722;, extending its voltage window to 6.0&#160;V. Consequently, this electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented critical current density (CCD) of 15.12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 25 &#176;C, long&#8208;term Li plating and stripping stability for 2700&#160;h, and a wide temperature window for dendrite inhibition from &#8722;30 to 150 &#176;C. Its Li&#8208;LiCoO2 cell displays high reversibility within 3.0&#8211;5.0&#160;V. It is believed that this work provides a clear direction for solid&#8208;state hydride electrolytes.

         <title>Scalable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite Photoanodes with &gt;100&#160;h Operational Stability Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical challenge for the application of perovskite photoelectrodes for solar fuels and feedstock generation is to overcome their instability in aqueous media and the use of expensive materials. In this work, a CsPbBr3 photoanode is presented that contains solely earth&#8208;abundant materials and reaches over 100&#160;h operational stability, which can be easily extended to weeks.








Abstract
The application of halide perovskites in the photoelectrochemical generation of solar fuels and feedstocks is hindered by the instability of perovskites in aqueous electrolytes and the use of expensive electrode and catalyst materials, particularly in photoanodes driving kinetically slow water oxidation. Here, solely earth&#8208;abundant materials are incorporated to fabricate a CsPbBr3&#8208;based photoanode that reaches a low onset potential of +0.4 VRHE and 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 photocurrent density at +1.23 VRHE for water oxidation, close to the radiative efficiency limit of CsPbBr3. This photoanode retains 100% of its stabilized photocurrent density for more than 100&#160;h of operation by replacing once the inexpensive graphite sheet upon signs of deterioration. The improved performance is due to an efficiently electrodeposited NiFeOOH catalyst on a protective self&#8208;adhesive graphite sheet, and enhanced charge transfer achieved by phase engineering of CsPbBr3. Devices with &gt;1 cm2 area, and low&#8208;temperature processing demonstrate the potential for low capital cost, stable, and scalable perovskite photoanodes.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance in Prussian Blue Analogues: Triple&#8208;Play of Metal Exsolution, Hollow Interiors, and Anionic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>

Hierarchical hollow core&#8211;shell FeMn@CoNi&#8211;Se PBA materials with metallic Ni NPs loading can be synthesized via low&#8208;temperature thermal treatment. The prepared PBA&#8208;Se 350 displays outstanding catalytic performance and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution, superior to commercial catalysts.








Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising catalysts for green hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical hollow core&#8211;shell FeMn@CoNi&#8211;Se PBA materials with metallic Ni NPs loading can be synthesized via low-temperature thermal treatment. The prepared PBA-Se 350 displays outstanding catalytic performance and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution, superior to commercial catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising catalysts for green hydrogen production. However, the rational design of high-performing PBAs is challenging, which requires an in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanism. Here FeMn@CoNi core&#8211;shell PBAs are employed as precursors, together with Se powders, in low-temperature pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere. This synthesis method enables the partial dissociation of inner FeMn PBAs that results in hollow interiors, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) exsolution to the surface, and Se incorporation onto the PBA shell. The resulting material presents ultralow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (184&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low Tafel slope (43.4&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), outperforming leading-edge PBA-based electrocatalysts. The mechanism responsible for such a high OER activity is revealed, assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the surface examination before and after the OER process.&#160;The exsolved Ni NPs are found to help turn the PBAs into Se-doped core&#8211;shell metal oxyhydroxides during the OER, in which the heterojunction with Ni and the Se incorporation are combined to improve the OER kinetics.

         <title>Ultrarapid&#8208;Acting Microneedles for Immediate Delivery of Biotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrarapid&#8208;acting microneedle (URA&#8208;MN) patch to realize immediate delivery of biotherapeutics with negligible residuals in tissue is presented. In this design, accelerated drug release is achieved by incorporating effervescent agents into the needle tip. The rapid release, easy administration, and excellent biocompatibility of URA&#8208;MN are well demonstrated in three different mouse models.








Abstract
Subcutaneous (SC) injection is a common administration route for rapid and efficient delivery of biotherapeutics. However, syringe&#8208;based injections usually require professional assistance and are associated with pain and potential risks of infections, thus leading to undesired patient compliance and poor life quality. Herein, this work presents an ultrarapid&#8208;acting microneedle (URA&#8208;MN) patch for immediate transdermal delivery of therapeutics in a minimally invasive manner. Effervescent agents are incorporated into the tip of URA&#8208;MN for rapid generation of CO2 bubbles upon insertion into the skin, immediately powering the biotherapeutics release within a few minutes. The release kinetics of diverse agents including liraglutide (LRT), insulin, and heparin from the URA&#8208;MN patches are evaluated in three different mouse models, and the rapid release of biotherapeutics and potent therapeutic effects are achieved with only 5 min administration. Noteworthily, attributed to the short application duration and negligible residuals of MN matrix remaining in the skin, the URA&#8208;MN patch shows desirable biocompatibility after six&#8208;week administration.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Electron&#8208;Acceptor Single Crystals with Chiral 2D Supramolecular Organization for Anisotropic Chiral Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing chiral centers into the fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor BTP&#8208;4F yields an intriguing 2D supramolecular organization consisting of intertwined, oppositely helical molecules, in which the intermolecular chiral exciton coupling is responsible for the chirality at the supramolecular level. A significant current dissymmetry factor exceeding &#8722;1.4 is achieved, whose amplified, inverted, and anisotropic current dissymmetry is revealed by the finite element simulations.








Abstract
Supramolecular chiral organization gives &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules access to fascinating specific interactions with circularly polarized light (CPL). Such a feature enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance chiral organic electronic devices that detect or emit CPL directly. Herein, it is shown that chiral fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;acceptor BTP&#8208;4F single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based phototransistors demonstrate distinguished CPL discrimination capability with current dissymmetry factor exceeding 1.4, one of the highest values among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art direct CPL detectors. Theoretical calculations prove that the chirality at the supramolecular level in these enantiomeric single crystals originates from chiral exciton coupling of a unique quasi&#8208;2D&#160;supramolecular organization consisting of interlaced molecules with opposite helical conformation. Impressively, such supramolecular organization produces a higher dissymmetry factor along the preferred growth direction of the chiral single crystals in comparison to that of the short axis direction. Furthermore, the amplified, inverted, and also anisotropic current dissymmetry compared to optical dissymmetry is studied by finite element simulations. Therefore, a unique chiral supramolecular organization that is responsible for the excellent chiroptical response and anisotropic electronic properties is developed, which not only enables the construction of high&#8208;performance CPL detection devices but also allows a better understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationships in chiral organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Breath Biopsy Reveals Systemic Immunothrombosis and Its Resolution through Bioorthogonal Dendritic Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of immunothrombosis is an unmet medical need as it relates to prevalent and life&#8208;threatening conditions, including severe COVID&#8208;19&#160;and sepsis. A novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive nanoprobe releases a volatile reporter molecule, when in contact with thrombin. The volatile reporter exits the circulation in the lungs. Analysis of the exhaled breath provides unprecedented quantitative knowledge of thrombin activity in vivo.








Abstract
Immunothrombosis, an inflammation&#8208;dependent activation of the coagulation cascade, leads to microthrombi formations in small vessels. It is a dreaded complication of COVID&#8208;19&#160;and a major cause of respiratory failure. Due to their size and disseminated nature, microthrombi are currently undetectable. Here, noninvasive detection of a volatile reporter in the exhaled air is introduced for assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. A dendritic nanoprobe, containing high loading of a thrombin&#8208;sensitive substrate, is selectively cleaved by thrombin, resulting in release of a synthetic bioorthogonal volatile organic compound (VOC). The VOC is quantitated in the exhaled air biopsies via gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS), allowing near real&#8208;time assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. The VOC detection can be further improved with more rapid and sensitive MS&#8208;based technologies. The amount of the VOC in the exhaled air decreases with resolution of the microvascular inflammation and intravascular fibrin depositions. Through conjugation of the thrombin&#8208;sensitive peptide with a rhodol derivative, a novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive fluorescent nanoprobe is developed for intravital visualization of thrombin activity in actively growing thrombi. These results establish unprecedented detection of thrombin activity in vivo, addressing this unmet medical need. This novel approach facilitates diagnosis of immunothrombosis in diseases such as diabetic complications, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torques and Spin Hall Magnetoresistance Generated by Twin&#8208;Free and Amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1 Topological Insulator Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi1&#8722;xSbx is a topological insulator with promising applications in spintronics and highly debated charge&#8211;spin conversion properties. Measurements of magnetoresistance and current&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit torques in Bi0.9Sb0.1/FeCo bilayers establish an isotropic charge&#8211;spin conversion efficiency of 1 in twin&#8208;free crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1 and 0.1 in amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1. Depending on temperature, thermally excited bulk carriers and the isotropic surface states contribute to the torques in crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1. &#160;








Abstract
Topological insulators have attracted great interest as generators of spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) in spintronic devices. Bi1&#8722;xSbx is a prominent topological insulator that has a high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency. However, the origin and magnitude of the SOTs induced by current&#8208;injection in Bi1&#8722;xSbx remain controversial. Here, the investigation of the SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance resulting from charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in twin&#8208;free epitaxial layers of Bi0.9Sb0.1(0001) coupled to FeCo are investigated, and compared with those of amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1. A large charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency of 1 in the first case and less than 0.1 in the second is found, confirming crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1 as a strong spin&#8208;injector material. The SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance are independent of the direction of the electric current, indicating that charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in single&#8208;crystal Bi0.9Sb0.1(0001) is isotropic despite the strong anisotropy of the topological surface states. Further, it is found that the damping&#8208;like SOT has a non&#8208;monotonic temperature dependence with a minimum at 20&#160;K. By correlating the SOT with resistivity and weak antilocalization measurements, charge&#8211;spin conversion is concluded to occur via thermally excited holes from the bulk states above 20&#160;K, and conduction through the isotropic surface states with increasing spin polarization due to decreasing electron&#8211;electron scattering below&#160;20&#160;K.

Measurements of magnetoresistance and current-induced spin&#8211;orbit torques in Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;/FeCo bilayers establish an isotropic charge&#8211;spin conversion efficiency of 1 in twin-free crystalline Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.1 in amorphous Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;. Depending on temperature, thermally excited bulk carriers and the isotropic surface states contribute to the torques in crystalline Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;. &#160;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topological insulators have attracted great interest as generators of spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) in spintronic devices. Bi&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; is a prominent topological insulator that has a high charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. However, the origin and magnitude of the SOTs induced by current-injection in Bi&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; remain controversial. Here, the investigation of the SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance resulting from charge-to-spin conversion in twin-free epitaxial layers of Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;(0001) coupled to FeCo are investigated, and compared with those of amorphous Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;. A large charge-to-spin conversion efficiency of 1 in the first case and less than 0.1 in the second is found, confirming crystalline Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt; as a strong spin-injector material. The SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance are independent of the direction of the electric current, indicating that charge-to-spin conversion in single-crystal Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;(0001) is isotropic despite the strong anisotropy of the topological surface states. Further, it is found that the damping-like SOT has a non-monotonic temperature dependence with a minimum at 20&#160;K. By correlating the SOT with resistivity and weak antilocalization measurements, charge&#8211;spin conversion is concluded to occur via thermally excited holes from the bulk states above 20&#160;K, and conduction through the isotropic surface states with increasing spin polarization due to decreasing electron&#8211;electron scattering below&#160;20&#160;K.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Scalable Polymer Electrolyte with Dual&#8208;Reinforced Stable Interface for 4.5&#160;V Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer electrolyte (F&amp;NPE) is developed to construct dual&#8208;reinforced stable interfaces, which can effectively suppress interfacial parasitic reactions and structural degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials. Meanwhile, a unique two&#8208;stage rheology&#8208;tuning UV polymerization strategy promising for continuous scalable fabrication is utilized. 4.5&#160;V NCM622//Li batteries achieve excellent long&#8208;term cyclability even with high cathode loading and thin Li.








Abstract
Hitherto, it remains a great challenge to stabilize electrolyte&#8211;electrode interfaces and impede lithium dendrite proliferation in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich LiNxCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (NCM) layer cathodes. Herein, a special molecular&#8208;level&#8208;designed polymer electrolyte is prepared by the copolymerization of hexafluorobutyl acrylate and methylene bisacrylamide to construct dual&#8208;reinforced stable interfaces. Verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, there are favorable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on Li metal anodes and robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. The SEI enriched in lithiophilic N&#8722;(C)3 guides the homogenous distribution of Li+ and facilitates the transport of Li+ through LiF and Li3N, promoting uniform Li+ plating and stripping. Moreover, the CEI with antioxidative amide groups can suppress the parasitic reactions between cathode and electrolyte and the structural degradation of cathode. Meanwhile, a unique two&#8208;stage rheology&#8208;tuning UV polymerization strategy is utilized, which is quite suited for continuous electrolyte fabrication with environmental friendliness. The fabricated polymer electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. 4.5&#160;V NCM622//Li batteries achieve prolonged operation with a retention rate of 85.0% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides new insights into molecular design and processibility design for polymer&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>MDM2&#8208;Targeting Reassembly Peptide (TRAP) Nanoparticles for p53&#8208;Based Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATO@MtrapNP construction, followed by MDM2&#8208;trap construction and mutated p53 rescuer delivering for oncotherapy is described. This strategy allows for efficient delivery of p53 mutation rescuers and thus suppresses the associated side effects. At the same time, the MDM2 trap can be constructed to efficiently inhibit MDM2 function, thereby protecting p53 from MDM2 inhibition.








Abstract
Gene mutations and functional inhibition are the major obstacles for p53&#8208;mediated oncotherapy. For p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors, the underlying mechanisms of functional inhibition of p53 during oncogenesis are unknown. The results reveal that the expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF is inhibited in p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors, indicating that the restoration of ARF could be a potential oncotherapy strategy for p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. Therefore, ARF&#8208;mimetic MDM2&#8208;targeting reassembly peptide nanoparticles (MtrapNPs) for p53&#8208;based tumor therapy is developed. The results elucidated that the MtrapNPs respond to and form a nanofiber structure with MDM2. By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilize and activate p53 for the inhibition of p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs are used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53&#8208;mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibit significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, the study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. Thus, the MDM2&#8208;trap strategy, which addresses both the inhibition and mutations of p53, is an efficient strategy for the treatment of p53&#8208;mutated tumors.

         <title>Computationally Guided Synthesis of MXenes by Dry Selective Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of a dry, fluorine&#8208;free MXene synthesis route is investigated through quantum mechanics calculations and thermodynamic modeling. Computational insights are experimentally validated to demonstrate synthesis of MXenes through dry selective extraction (DSE) of MAX phase precursors using iodine vapor under suitable temperatures and pressures. The DSE approach opens avenues for the sustainable and scalable synthesis of new MXenes.








Abstract
MXenes are a rapidly growing family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides and nitrides&#160;that&#160;are promising for various applications, including energy storage and conversion, electronics, and healthcare. Hydrofluoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based etchants are typically used for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;throughput synthesis of MXenes, which also leads to a mixture of surface terminations that impede MXene properties. Herein, a computational thermodynamic model with experimental validation is presented to explore the feasibility of fluorine&#8208;free synthesis of MXenes with uniform surface terminations by dry selective extraction (DSE) from precursor MAX phases using iodine vapors. A range of MXenes&#160;and respective precursor compositions are systematically screened using first&#8208;principles calculations to find candidates with high phase stability and low etching energy. A thermodynamic model based on the &#8220;CALculation of PHAse Diagrams&#8221; (CALPHAD) approach is further demonstrated, using Ti3C2I2 as an example, to assess the Gibbs free energy of the DSE reaction and the state of the byproducts as a function of temperature and pressure. Based on the assessment, the optimal synthesis temperature and vapor pressure are predicted and further verified by experiments. This work opens an avenue for scalable, fluorine&#8208;free dry synthesis of MXenes with compositions and surface chemistries that are not accessible using wet chemical etching.

         <title>Pulsed&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Tetragonal BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient pressure induced by a 355&#160;nm pulsed laser (PL) builds a pulsed built&#8208;in electric field on tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T), contributing to the photoinduced carrier separation and band bending of the BTO&#8208;T. The PL&#8208;triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and efficient continuous photocatalysis (0.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The recombination of photoinduced carriers in photocatalysts is considered one of the biggest barriers to the increase of photocatalytic efficiency. Piezoelectric photocatalysts open a new route to realize rapid carrier separation by mechanically distorting the lattice of piezoelectric nanocrystals to form a piezoelectric potential within the nanocrystals, generally requiring external force (e.g., ultrasonic radiation, mechanical stirring, and ball milling). In this study, a low&#8208;power UV pulsed laser (PL) (3&#160;W, 355&#160;nm) as a UV light source can trigger piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction of tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T) in the absence of an applied force. The tremendous transient light pressure (5.7 &#215; 107&#160;Pa, 2.7&#160;W) of 355&#160;nm PL not only bends the energy band of BTO&#8208;T, thus allowing reactions that cannot theoretically occur to take place, but also induces a pulsed built&#8208;in electric field to determine an efficient photoinduced carrier separation. On that basis, the PL&#8208;triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes the highest reported performance, reaching a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the continuous catalytic system. The method in this study is promising to contribute to the design of efficient piezoelectric photocatalytic reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The transient pressure induced by a 355&#160;nm pulsed laser (PL) builds a pulsed built-in electric field on tetragonal BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BTO-T), contributing to the photoinduced carrier separation and band bending of the BTO-T. The PL-triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction realizes a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and efficient continuous photocatalysis (0.8&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recombination of photoinduced carriers in photocatalysts is considered one of the biggest barriers to the increase of photocatalytic efficiency. Piezoelectric photocatalysts open a new route to realize rapid carrier separation by mechanically distorting the lattice of piezoelectric nanocrystals to form a piezoelectric potential within the nanocrystals, generally requiring external force (e.g., ultrasonic radiation, mechanical stirring, and ball milling). In this study, a low-power UV pulsed laser (PL) (3&#160;W, 355&#160;nm) as a UV light source can trigger piezoelectric photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction of tetragonal BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BTO-T) in the absence of an applied force. The tremendous transient light pressure (5.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Pa, 2.7&#160;W) of 355&#160;nm PL not only bends the energy band of BTO-T, thus allowing reactions that cannot theoretically occur to take place, but also induces a pulsed built-in electric field to determine an efficient photoinduced carrier separation. On that basis, the PL-triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction realizes the highest reported performance, reaching a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and achieving efficient photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in the continuous catalytic system. The method in this study is promising to contribute to the design of efficient piezoelectric photocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticle Supercrystals: From Photoactivation of Hydrogen Evolution to Photocorrosion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic activity of plasmonic supercrystals made of Ag@Pt nanoparticles is monitored through operando nanobubble imaging by high&#8208;resolution optical microscopy. The degradation mechanisms following light irradiation are investigated at the single supercrystal and nanoparticle level by correlative microscopy and high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8211;electron energy loss spectroscopy, respectively.








Abstract
Gas nanobubbles are directly linked to many important chemical reactions. While they can be detrimental to operational devices, they also reflect the local activity at the nanoscale. Here, supercrystals made of highly monodisperse Ag@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoparticles are first grown onto a solid support and fully characterized by electron microscopies and X&#8208;ray scattering. Supercrystals are then used as a plasmonic photocatalytic platform for triggering the hydrogen evolution reaction. The catalytic activity is measured operando at the single supercrystal level by high&#8208;resolution optical microscopy, which allows gas nanobubble nucleation to be probed at the early stage with high temporal resolution and the amount of gas molecules trapped inside them to be quantified. Finally, a correlative microscopy approach and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy help to decipher the mechanisms at the origin of the local degradation of the supercrystals during catalysis, namely nanoscale erosion and corrosion.

         <title>Evidence of Nodal Superconductivity in Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 with Hidden Order Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconventional, nodal superconductors appear in many strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. However, nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have not yet been reported. The scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on 1H&#8208;TaS2 demonstrate nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting states.








Abstract
Unconventional superconductors represent one of the fundamental directions in modern quantum materials research. In particular, nodal superconductors are known to appear naturally in strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. Van der Waals materials hosting superconducting states are well known, yet nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have remained elusive. Here, using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, it is shown that pristine monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 realizes a nodal superconducting state. Non&#8208;magnetic disorder drives the nodal superconducting state to a conventional gapped s&#8208;wave state. Furthermore, many&#8208;body excitations emerge close to the gap edge, signalling a potential unconventional pairing mechanism. The results demonstrate the emergence of nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting&#160;states.

         <title>Non&#8208;Lignin Constructing the Gas&#8211;Solid Interface for Enhancing the Photothermal Catalytic Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K&#8208;SrTiO3&#8208;loaded TiN silica wool (K&#8208;STO/TiN SW) is used to build photothermal&#8211;photocatalytic system. TiN SW enables stable steam production and produced a gas/solid reaction interface with a lower Gibbs free energy. This enables K&#8208;STO to split water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen, and ensures that the TiN SW substrate material does not involve in the catalytic reaction.








Abstract
The progress of solar&#8208;driven water&#8208;splitting technology has been impeded by the limited light response capability of semiconductor materials. Despite attempts to leverage nearly 50% of infrared radiation for photothermal synergy and catalytic reaction enhancement, heat loss during liquid phase reactions results in low energy conversion efficiency. Here, the photothermally driven catalytic water&#8208;splitting system, which designs K&#8208;SrTiO3&#8208;loaded TiN silica wool at the water&#8211;air interface. Photocatalytic tests and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the thermal effect transforms liquid water into water vapor, thereby reducing the reaction free energy of catalysts and improving the transmission rate of catalytic products. Hence, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches 275.46&#160;mmol m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency is 1.81% under 1 sun irradiation in this gas&#8211;solid system, which is more than twice that of liquid water splitting. This novel photothermal catalytic pathway, which involves a coupled reaction of water evaporation and water splitting, is anticipated to broaden the utilization range of the solar spectrum and significantly enhance the conversion efficiency of STH.

         <title>Anion Confinement for Homogeneous Mixed Halide Perovskite Film Growth by Electrospray</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospray deposition shows great advance to bridge the gap of growth rate between iodide and bromide components by spatially confining the anion diffusion, which universally improves the homogeneity of perovskite films. As a result, the efficiency and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs are significantly promoted.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites are promising absorbers for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandem solar cells to feasibly surpass Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit with low cost. However, the commonly used mixed halide perovskites suffer from poor stability; particularly, photoinduced phase segregation. Electrospray deposition is developed to bridge the gap of growth rate between iodide and bromide components during film growth by spatially confining the anion diffusion and eliminating the kinetic difference, which universally improves the initial homogeneity of perovskite films regardless of device architectures. It thus promotes the efficiency and stability of corresponding solar cells based on wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68&#160;eV) absorbers. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.44% and 20.77% are achieved in 0.08 cm2 and 1.0 cm2 devices, respectively. In addition, these devices maintain 90% of their initial PCE after 1550&#160;h of stabilized power output (SPO) tracking upon one sun irradiation (LED) at room temperature.

         <title>An AND Logic Gate for Magnetic&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Ferroptosis Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IO) with the function of an AND logic gate are designed and constructed for enhancing the sensitivity of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsiveness, whose advantages include the conversion of negative T2 signal to positive T1 signal under the dual action of ROS and GSH in the TME and high&#8208;performance ferroptosis therapy of tumors.








Abstract
To improve the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) efficiency and ferroptosis therapy efficacy of exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IO, &lt;5&#160;nm) for tumors via enhancing the sensitivity of tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness, inspired by molecular logic gates, a self&#8208;assembled IO with an AND logic gate function is designed and constructed. Typically, cystamine (CA) is conjugated onto the end of poly(2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;ethanol methacrylate) (PMEMA) to generate PMEMA&#8208;CA. The PMEMA&#8208;CA is grafted onto the surface of brequinar (BQR)&#8208;loaded IO to form IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA. The self&#8208;assembled IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA (SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA) is obtained due to the hydrophobicity of PMEMA. The carbon&#8211;sulfur single bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME to a thio&#8211;oxygen double bond, resulting in the conversion from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The disulfide bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be broken by the glutathione (GSH) in the TME, leading to the shedding of PMEMA from the IO surface. Under the dual actions of ROS and GSH in TME (i.e., AND logic gate), SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA can be disassembled to release IO, Fe2+/3+, and BQR. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the AND logic gate function and mechanism, the high T1 MRI performance and exceptional ferroptosis therapy efficacy for tumors, and the excellent biosafety of SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA.

         <title>Antibacterial Fusobacterium nucleatum&#8208;Mimicking Nanomedicine to Selectively Eliminate Tumor&#8208;Colonized Bacteria and Enhance Immunotherapy Against Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fusobacterium&#160;nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine is presented, by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin&#8208;loaded liposomes&#160;to achieve selective killing of tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum. In F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous colorectal tumor models and a chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer model, such F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine can effectively relieve F. nucleatum&#8208;derived pro&#8208;tumoral microenvironment and improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Clinical evidence indicates that tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria can be closely related to the tumor development and therapeutic responses. Selectively eliminating bacteria within tumors may be an attractive approach to enhance cancer treatment without additional side effects. Herein, it is found that, owing to the high affinity between the membrane protein Fap&#8208;2 on Fusobacterium nucleatum and d&#8208;galactose&#8208;&#946; (1&#8208;3)&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine (Gal&#8208;GalNAc) overexpressed on colorectal tumor cells, F. nucleatum can colonize in colorectal tumors, as evidenced by both clinical samples and animal tumor models. Notably, F. nucleatum colonized in colorectal tumors can lead to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, greatly reducing their responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Inspired by this finding, an F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine is designed by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin&#8208;loaded liposomes to achieve selective killing of tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum without affecting gut microbes. As a result, the therapeutic responses of F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized tumors to ICB therapies can be successfully restored, as demonstrated in an F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous CT&#8208;26 tumor model, chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer models, and MC&#8208;38 tumor model. In summary, this work presents an F. nucleatum&#8208;mimicking nanomedicine that can selectively eliminate tumor&#8208;colonized bacteria, which is promising for enhancing the responses of cancer immunotherapy against F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized colorectal cancer.

         <title>Phosphorescent&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 37% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes with TFB:10 wt% Ir(MDQ)2(acac) as hole&#8208;transport layer and exciton harvester realize a record high external quantum efficiency of 37% (37.3 cd A&#8722;1, 41 lm W&#8722;1) and a central wavelength of 628 nm with narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum of 23.4 nm. The devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.








Abstract
Exciton harvesting is of paramount importance for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Direct exciton harvesting by the quantum dots (QDs) emitting layer suffers from poor hole injection due to the low conduction bands and valence bands of QDs, leading to unbalanced electron&#8211;hole injection and recombination. To address this issue, here, an exciton sensitizing approach is reported, where excitons form on a phosphorescent&#8208;dye&#8208;doped layer, which then transfer their energies to adjacent QDs layer for photon emission. Due to the very efficient exciton formation and energy&#8208;transfer processes, higher device performance can be achieved. To demonstrate the above strategy, red QLEDs with a phosphorescent dye, iridium (III) bis(2&#8208;methyldibenzo&#8208;[f,h]quinoxaline) (acetylacetonate), Ir(MDQ)2(acac), doped hole&#8208;transporting layer are fabricated and studied. At a doping concentration of 10&#160;wt%, the best device achieves record high current efficiency, power efficiency, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, 41&#160;lm W&#8722;1, and 37%, respectively. Simultaneously, the efficiency roll&#8208;off characteristic is greatly improved, in that 35% EQE can be well retained at a high luminance level of 450&#8201;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Moreover, the devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.

         <title>A Smart Single&#8208;Fluorophore Polymer: Self&#8208;Assembly Shapechromic Multicolor Fluorescence and Erasable Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart single&#8208;fluorophore polymer polyethyleneimine&#8208;grafted pyrene (PGP) incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers: amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8211;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites, exhibits deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. Besides, PGP driven by its reversible chelation capacity can be used as an advanced fluorescent ink with erasable and recoverable properties.








Abstract
A novel smart fluorescent polymer polyethyleneimine&#8208;grafted pyrene (PGP) is developed by incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers at molecular level. The triggers are amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8211;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites. PGP exhibits smart deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. It can deform into three typical shapes with a characteristic fluorescence color, namely, spherical core&#8211;shell micelles of cyan&#8208;green fluorescence, standard rectangular nanosheets of yellow fluorescence, and irregular branches of deep&#8208;blue fluorescence. A quasi&#8208;reversible deformation between the first two shapes can be dynamically manipulated. Moreover, driven by reversible coordination and the resulting intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, PGP can be used as an aqueous fluorescence ink with erasable and recoverable properties. The fluorescent patterns printed by PGP ink on paper can be rapidly erased and recovered by simple spraying a sequence of Cu2+ and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid aqueous solutions. This erase/recover transformation can be repeated multiple times on the same paper. The multiple stimulus responsiveness of PGP makes it have potential applications in nanorobots, sensing, information encryption, and anticounterfeiting.

It can deform into three typical shapes with a characteristic fluorescence color, namely, spherical core&#8211;shell micelles of cyan-green fluorescence, standard rectangular nanosheets of yellow fluorescence, and irregular branches of deep-blue fluorescence. A quasi-reversible deformation between the first two shapes can be dynamically manipulated. Moreover, driven by reversible coordination and the resulting intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, PGP can be used as an aqueous fluorescence ink with erasable and recoverable properties. The fluorescent patterns printed by PGP ink on paper can be rapidly erased and recovered by simple spraying a sequence of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid aqueous solutions. This erase/recover transformation can be repeated multiple times on the same paper. The multiple stimulus responsiveness of PGP makes it have potential applications in nanorobots, sensing, information encryption, and anticounterfeiting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Directional Control of Thermal Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directional control of thermal emission is key to efficient radiative heat transport. However, achieving angular&#8208;asymmetric directionality remains challenging in reciprocal systems due to symmetric band dispersion. In this work, asymmetric directional thermal emission is demonstrated using symmetry&#8208;broken metagratings. The design principle holds promise for developing ultrathin customized thermal sources and impacts on thermal&#8208;engineering applications.








Abstract
Control over the directionality of thermal emission plays a fundamental role in efficient heat transport. Although nanophotonic technologies have demonstrated the capability for angular&#8208;selective thermal emission, achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems with energy directed to a single output angle remains challenging due to symmetric band dispersion. In this work, a general strategy for achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems is presented. With periodic perturbation and broken mirror symmetry, metasurfaces behave as resonant metagratings whose resonances can be diffracted to symmetric output angles with distinct efficiency, allowing for high emissivity toward a single direction. An asymmetric directional thermal emitter is experimentally demonstrated at mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths with high emissivity (&#603;&#160;=&#160;0.61) at the observation angle of +30&#176;, and low emissivity (&#603; &lt; 0.3) at other angles. This work highlights the potential for manipulating the directionality of thermal emission, which holds promise for developing ultrathin customized thermal sources and impacts on various thermal&#8208;engineering applications.

Immunothrombosis
Thrombin's enzymatic activity in the living organism was for the first time measured in the exhaled breath. Novel nanoprobes released a gaseous reporter in potentially fatal microthrombi. This technology aims to improve precision of care in serious conditions including sepsis, COVID&#8208;19, diabetes complications, and lung fibrosis. More details can be found in article number 2304903 by Ali Hafezi&#8208;Moghadam and co&#8208;workers. Nanoprobes and fibrin strands in a microvessel were digitally painted by Dr. Alexander Schering.

Atomic&#8208;Scale Synthesis
In article number 2301560 by Ondrej Dyck, Andrew R. Lupini, and Stephen Jesse, a vision for a revolution in STEM capabilities is presented. The vision is a &#8220;synthescope&#8221; &#8208; an instrument that can image, characterize, synthesize, and manipulate materials at the atomic scale through advanced microscopy techniques. The critical insight is the delivery of atomized material to the sample for a combined top&#8208;down (fabrication) and bottom&#8208;up (synthesis) approach to atomic&#8208;scale materials engineering.

3D&#8208;Printed Ferromagnetic Liquid Crystal Elastome
In article number 2302824, Liu Wang, Ji Liu, Shiwu Zhang, Mujun Li, and co&#8208;workers report 3D printing of a ferromagnetic liquid crystal elastomer (magLCE) whose nematic order and magnetization can be independently programmed with magnetic field and shear flow assistance. The 3D&#8208;printed magLCE exhibit designable multi&#8208;modal shape morphing under different stimuli, which is promising for wireless soft robots and intelligent devices.

High Energy Density Capacitors
In article number 2302554, Long&#8208;Qing Chen, Shashank Priya, Dae&#8208;Yong Jeong, Jungho Ryu, and co&#8208;workers reveal a giant energy storage density of over 120 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh breakdown strength of 540 MV m&#8722;1 (equivalent to the breakdown strength of ferroelectric polymers) in a nanograin engineered PZT thick film. The nano&#8208;grain architecture composite microstructure of crystalline and amorphous phase with the same composition, achieved through mechanical tailoring, exhibits artificial relaxor ferroelectric behavior, which dramatically expands the material design space.

         <title>Stabilizing Metal Halide Perovskites for Solar Fuel Production: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as one of the promising photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their exceptional photophysical properties. This review focuses on their most pressing stability issue for practical applications and summarizes the latest stabilization strategies to design and prepare water&#8208;stable perovskite photocatalysts.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are emerging photocatalyst materials that can enable sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion by virtue of their broad absorption spectra, effective separation/transport of photogenerated carriers, and solution processability. Although preliminary studies show the excellent photocatalytic activities of MHPs, their intrinsic structural instability due to the low formation energy and soft ionic nature is an open challenge for their practical applications. This review discusses the latest understanding of the stability issue and strategies to overcome this issue for MHP&#8208;based photocatalysis. First, the origin of the instability issue at atomic levels and the design rules for robust structures are analyzed and elucidated. This is then followed by presenting several different material design strategies for stability enhancement, including reaction medium modification, material surface protection, structural dimensionality engineering, and chemical composition engineering. Emphases are placed on understanding the effects of these strategies on photocatalytic stability as well as the possible structure&#8208;performance correlation. Finally, the possible future research directions for pursuing stable and efficient MHP photocatalysts in order to accelerate their technological maturity on a practical scale are outlined. With that, it is hoped to provide readers a valuable snapshot of this rapidly developing and exciting field.

         <title>Liquid Crystals for Advanced Smart Devices with Microwave and Millimeter&#8208;Wave Applications: Recent Progress for Next&#8208;Generation Communications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective focuses on using liquid crystals (LCs) to improve driving performance and add special functions to smart RF devices. Since the design of the RF device itself imposes limits on maximization of performance, it must be considered in the materials domain. The fundamental understanding of LCs for advanced reconfigurable telecommunication devices and key research directions are discussed, suggesting design strategies for LCs in advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and functionality.








Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) technology have a well&#8208;established history of applications in visible light, particularly in the display industry. However, with the rapid growth in communication technology, LCs have become a topic of current interest for high&#8208;frequency microwave (MW) and millimeter&#8208;wave (mmWave) applications due to promising characteristics such as tunability, continuous tuning, low losses, and price compatibility. To improve the performance of future communication technology using LCs, it is not sufficient only with the perspective of radio&#8208;frequency (RF) technology. Therefore, it is imperative to understand not only the novel structural designs and optimization of MW engineering but also the perspective of materials engineering when implementing advanced RF devices with maximum performance for next&#8208;generation satellite and terrestrial communication. Herein, based on advanced nematic LCs, polymer&#8208;modified LCs, dual&#8208;frequency LCs, and photo&#8208;reactive LCs, this article summarizes and examines the modulation principles and key research directions for the design strategies of LCs for advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and novel functionality. Furthermore, the challenges in development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart RF devices that use LCs are discussed.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials, from property prediction and geometry generation to inverse design. It is highly anticipated that deep learning can bring about significant advancements in mechanical metamaterials by creating universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence in the near&#160;future.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are meticulously designed structures with exceptional mechanical properties determined by their microstructures and constituent materials. Tailoring their material and geometric distribution unlocks the potential to achieve unprecedented bulk properties and functions. However, current mechanical metamaterial design considerably relies on experienced designers' inspiration through trial and error, while investigating their mechanical properties and responses entails time&#8208;consuming mechanical testing or computationally expensive simulations. Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the design process of mechanical metamaterials, enabling property prediction and geometry generation without prior knowledge. Furthermore, deep generative models can transform conventional forward design into inverse design. Many recent studies on the implementation of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials are highly specialized, and their pros and cons may not be immediately evident. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in property prediction, geometry generation, and inverse design of mechanical metamaterials. Additionally, this review highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning to create universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence. This article is expected to be valuable not only to researchers working on mechanical metamaterials but also those in the field of materials&#160;informatics.

         <title>Ultrafast and Controlled Capturing, Loading, and Release of Extracellular Vesicles by a Portable Microstructured Electrochemical Fluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable device that offers an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip approach, capable of separating extracellular vesicles directly from biological fluids in a simple and efficient manner, while also allowing their subsequent manipulation, is reported. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all living cells and are found in body fluids. They exert numerous physiological and pathological functions and serve as cargo shuttles. Due to their safety and inherent bioactivity, they have emerged as versatile therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. Despite the growing interest in EVs, current progress in this field is, in part, limited by relatively inefficient isolation techniques. Conventional methods are indeed slow, laborious, require specialized laboratory equipment, and may result in low yield and purity. This work describes an electrochemically controlled &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; device enabling capturing, loading, and releasing of EVs. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes. It rapidly isolates EVs with a high level of purity from various biofluids. As a proof of principle, the device is applied to isolate EVs from skin wounds of healthy and diabetic mice. Strikingly, it is found that EVs from healing wounds of diabetic mice are enriched in mitochondrial proteins compared to those of healthy mice. Additionally, the device improves the loading protocol of EVs with polyplexes, and may therefore find applications in nucleic acid delivery. Overall, the electrochemical device can greatly facilitate the development of EVs&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Toward Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Crystal Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing membrane consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) layers is demonstrated. Two CLCs layers with same helical structure act as reflectors to construct a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. The selective reflection of CLCs leads to polarization selectivity. The membrane device is highly flexible and all&#8208;solution&#8208;processable and exhibits a high dissymmetry factor of 1.4.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultraflexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultraflexibility enables the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from a PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultraflexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Assemblable Bespoke Scaffold as a Versatile Microcryogel Carrier for Site&#8208;Specific Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE) can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so surgeons can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. This simple and cost&#8208;effective patient&#8208;specific implant reduces the healthcare system burden.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing have led to diverse patient&#8208;specific implant designs utilizing computed tomography, but this requires intensive work and financial implications. Here, Digital Light Processing is used to fabricate a hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE). HIVE can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so a surgeon can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect before implantation. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels (MC) incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. After characterization, possible site&#8208;specific applications are investigated by utilizing HIVE as a versatile carrier with incorporated treatments such as growth factors (GF), bioceramic, or cells. HIVE as a GF&#8208;carrier shows a controlled release of bone morphogenetic protein/vascular endothelial growth factor (BMP/VEGF) and induced osteogenesis/angiogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)/human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, as a bioceramic&#8208;carrier, HIVE demonstrates enhanced mineralization and osteogenesis, and as a HUVEC carrier, it upregulates both osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression of hMSCs. HIVE with different combinations of MCs yields a distinct local effect and successful cell migration is confirmed within assembled HIVEs. Finally, an in vivo&#160;rat subcutaneous implantation demonstrates site&#8208;specific osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

         <title>Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Observation of Phonon Polaritons in Wafer&#8208;Scale Multilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared nanoimaging reveals propagating phonon polaritons on wafer&#8208;scale nanometer&#8208;thick hexagonal boron nitride grown by chemical vapor deposition. The material quality allows for the fabrication of phonon polariton nanoresonators with quality factors comparable to those fabricated from exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride, paving the way for wafer&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Polaritons in layered materials (LMs) are a promising platform to manipulate and control light at the nanometer scale. Thus, the observation of polaritons in wafer&#8208;scale LMs is critically important for the development of industrially relevant nanophotonics and optoelectronics applications. In this work, phonon polaritons (PhPs) in wafer&#8208;scale multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition are reported. By infrared nanoimaging, the PhPs are visualized, and PhP lifetimes of &#8776;0.6&#160;ps are measured, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. Further, PhP nanoresonators are demonstrated. Their quality factors of &#8776;50 are about 0.7 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices based on exfoliated hBN. These results can enable PhP&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.

By infrared nanoimaging, the PhPs are visualized, and PhP lifetimes of &#8776;0.6&#160;ps are measured, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. Further, PhP nanoresonators are demonstrated. Their quality factors of &#8776;50 are about 0.7 times that of state-of-the-art devices based on exfoliated hBN. These results can enable PhP-based surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fundamentals, Advances, and Artifacts in Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence enables exciting applications such as holography, advanced cryptography, and energy&#8208;efficient displays. This Perspective lays out the fundamentals of the corresponding spectroscopic technique and reports a home&#8208;built setup. The corrections necessary for accurate measurements as well as the most common artifacts and pitfalls to avoid are detailed. Custom operating software is made available free of charge.








Abstract
Objects are chiral when they cannot be superimposed with their mirror image. Materials can emit chiral light with an excess of right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed circular polarization. This circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is key to promising future applications, such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. Here, a practical guide to CPL spectroscopy is provided. First, the fundamentals of the technique are laid out and a detailed account of recent experimental advances to achieve highly sensitive and accurate measurements is given, including all corrections required to obtain reliable results. Then the most common artifacts and pitfalls are discussed, especially for the study of thin films, for example, based on molecules, polymers, or halide perovskites, as opposed to dilute solutions of emitters. To facilitate the adoption by others, custom operating software is made publicly available, equipping the reader with the tools needed for successful and accurate CPL determination.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Perovskite LEDs with an Integrated Distributed Feedback Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave lasing in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator is achieved, showing a low threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. The LED can also work well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.








Abstract
Realization of electrically pumped laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processed semiconductors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Metal halide perovskites have shown great potential toward this goal due to their&#160;excellent optoelectronic properties. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) optically pumped lasing in a real electroluminescent device represents a key step to current&#8208;injection laser diodes, but it has not yet been realized. This is mainly due to the challenge of incorporating a resonant cavity into an efficient light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) able to sustain intensive carrier injection. Here, CW lasing is reported in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator, which shows a low lasing threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. Importantly, the LED works well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Like Stretchable Nanocomposite Using Locally&#8208;Bundled Nanowires for Skin&#8208;Mountable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable nanocomposite with metal&#8208;like conductivity and high stretchability is proposed. When the nanocomposite is solidified in the highly humid air, silver nanowires are locally&#8208;bundled, minimizing contact resistance. Treatment of dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol improves conductivity further to &#8776;120 000 S cm&#8722;1 while attaining high stretchability of &#8776;200% for skin&#8208;mountable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable conductive nanocomposites have been intensively studied for wearable bioelectronics. However, development of nanocomposites that simultaneously feature metal&#8208;like conductivity(&gt; 100 000 S cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&gt; 100%) for high&#8208;performance skin&#8208;mountable devices is still extremely challenging. Here&#160;a material strategy for such a nanocomposite is&#160;presented by using local bundling of silver nanowires stabilized with dual ligands (i.e., 1&#8208;propanethiols and 1&#8208;decanethiols). When the nanocomposite&#160;is&#160;solidified via solvent evaporation under a highly humid condition, the nanowires in the organic solution are bundled and stabilized. The resulting locally&#8208;bundled nanowires lower contact resistance while maintain their percolation network, leading to high conductivity. Dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol further boost up the conductivity. As a result, a nanocomposite with both high conductivity of &#8776;122,120 S cm&#8722;1 and high stretchability of &#8776;200% is obtained. Such superb electrical and mechanical properties are critical for various applications in skin&#8208;like electronics, and&#160;herein, a wearable thermo&#8208;stimulation device is demonstrated.

         <title>A Cholesterol Metabolic Regulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;Based Biotuner for Antibody Non&#8208;Dependent Immunotherapy Tailored for Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanocarrier, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based biotuner, regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism for bidirectionally blocking immune checkpoints to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive microenvironment. It synergizes with chemiexcited&#8208;PDT to enable effective immunotherapy and significantly inhibit glioblastoma growth. The biotuner is tailored to address the immunotherapeutic dilemma and metabolic characteristics of glioblastomas, providing new insights into the metabolically regulated immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastomas.








Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma (GBM) poses a tremendous obstacle to effective immunotherapy due to its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) specifically designed for GBM immunotherapy is developed, taking advantage of the relatively isolated cholesterol metabolism microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS). The HOF&#8208;based biotuner regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism, effectively blocking the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) pathway and reducing 2B4 expression. This metabolically disrupts the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM and rejuvenates CD8+ T cells. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism regulation offers additional benefits in treating GBM invasion. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;initiated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT) is enhanced during the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and the biotuner can effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in GBM. By reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and bolstering chemiexcited&#8208;PDT, this approach invigorates efficient antibody non&#8208;dependent immunotherapy for GBM. This study provides a model for enhancing immunotherapy through cholesterol metabolism regulation and explores the feasibility of a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; strategy in GBM treatment.

         <title>Engineering Efficient CAR&#8208;T Cells via Electroactive Nanoinjection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform consisting of arrays of vertically configured conductive nanotubes, which mediate the loading and efficient nanoinjection of CAR construct into primary human T cells, with negligible cellular damage, is developed. The engineered ENI platform provides a non&#8208;viral, low&#8208;voltage (10&#160;V), scalable, and reusable intracellular delivery system that can generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy has emerged as a promising cell&#8208;based immunotherapy approach for treating blood disorders and cancers, but genetically engineering CAR&#8208;T cells is challenging due to primary T cells&#8217; sensitivity to conventional gene delivery approaches. The current viral&#8208;based method can typically involve significant operating costs and biosafety hurdles, while bulk electroporation (BEP) can lead to poor cell viability and functionality. Here, a non&#8208;viral electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform is developed to efficiently negotiate the plasma membrane of primary human T cells via vertically configured electroactive nanotubes, enabling efficient delivery (68.7%) and expression (43.3%) of CAR genes in the T cells, with minimal cellular perturbation (&gt;90% cell viability). Compared to conventional BEP, the ENI platform achieves an almost threefold higher CAR transfection efficiency, indicated by the significantly higher reporter GFP expression (43.3% compared to 16.3%). By co&#8208;culturing with target lymphoma Raji cells, the ENI&#8208;transfected CAR&#8208;T cells&#8217; ability to effectively suppress lymphoma cell growth (86.9% cytotoxicity) is proved. Taken together, the results demonstrate the platform's remarkable capacity to generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells. Given the growing potential of cell&#8208;based immunotherapies, such a platform holds great promise for ex vivo cell engineering, especially in CAR&#8208;T cell therapy.

         <title>A Balance between Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Microgel Mechanics Governs Stem Cell Viability in Injectable Dynamic Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guest&#8208;host injectable microgel formulation strategy is introduced in which flowability and elasticity are tuned independently by modulating inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;microgel crosslinking. Flowability and elasticity represent conflicting constraints for injectable design, &#160;as they respectively govern injection protection and engraftment potential following injection. The balance between these parameters is systematically investigated and found to regulate stem cell viability during injection.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are increasingly explored for the delivery of cells to tissue. These materials exhibit both liquid&#8208;like properties, protecting cells from mechanical stress during injection, and solid&#8208;like properties, providing a stable 3D engraftment niche. Many strategies for modulating injectable hydrogels tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like material properties simultaneously, such that formulation changes designed to improve injectability can reduce stability at the delivery site. The ability to independently tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like properties would greatly facilitate formulation development. Here, such a strategy is presented in which cells are ensconced in the pores between microscopic granular hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels (microgels), where elasticity is tuned with static covalent intra&#8208;microgel crosslinks and flowability with mechanosensitive adamantane&#8208;cyclodextrin (AC) inter&#8208;microgel crosslinks. Using the same AC&#8208;free microgels as a 3D printing support bath, the location of each cell is preserved as it exits the needle, allowing identification of&#160;the mechanism driving mechanical trauma&#8208;induced cell death. The microgel AC concentration is varied to find the threshold from microgel yielding&#8208; to AC interaction&#8208;dominated injectability, and this threshold is exploited to fabricate a microgel with better injection&#8208;protecting performance. This delivery strategy, and the balance between intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;microgel properties it reveals, may facilitate the development of new cell injection formulations.

         <title>Universal Strategy of Efficient Intracellular Macromolecule Directional Delivery Using Photothermal Pump Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal pump patch is proposed as a universal structure for a highly efficient, non&#8208;destructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule directional delivery. It is based on poly(dimethyl siloxane) photothermal expansion&#8208;driven pore shrinkage, which directionally delivers macromolecules into the cell to improve intracellular delivery efficiency. It is also suitable for transdermal intracellular delivery and has broad potential in the fields of cell/gene therapy.








Abstract
The development of a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable universal delivery strategy of therapeutic macromolecules into desired cells and tissues is very challenging. Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; is reported. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high&#8208;efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high&#8208;efficiency, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable macromolecule delivery.

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurfaces without the Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing metasurface based on orthogonal phase encoding is demonstrated to implement a near&#8208;field optical router. Bragg diffraction, which plays a vital role in traditional volume holography,is replaced by mode&#8208;matching surface waves, resulting in the realization of ultrathin metadevices. The method facilitates further development of an additional degree of freedom in the field of photonic multiplexing.








Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the 2D nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in 3D space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the 2D design. An example of code&#8208;based all&#8208;optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which can find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Reversible Multielectron Redox Chemistry in a NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe&#8208;substituted Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 cathode with Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type structure is proposed, which realizes reversible structural evolution and multielectron redox reactions (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) by incorporating iron, whose unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital are inextricably related to the activation of higher&#8208;voltage redox couple.








Abstract
Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON&#8208;type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe&#8208;substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high&#8208;voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10&#160;000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions.

     alt="Reversible Multielectron Redox Chemistry in a NASICON-Type Cathode toward High-Energy-Density and Long-Life Sodium-Ion Full Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel Fe-substituted Na&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cathode with Na-superionic-conductor (NASICON)-type structure is proposed, which realizes reversible structural evolution and multielectron redox reactions (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, and V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;) by incorporating iron, whose unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital are inextricably related to the activation of higher-voltage redox couple.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na-superionic-conductor (NASICON)-type cathodes (e.g., Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON-type cathodes. Herein, Na&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (NVFP) is designed by an Fe-substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high-voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10&#160;000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, and V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic-migration energy barrier and ideal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher-valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high-rate capability and long-duration cycling lifespan (3000&#160;stable cycles at 50 C), along with material-level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Directional Shunting of Photogenerated Carriers in POM@MOF for Promoting Nitrogen Adsorption and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 composite is prepared by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction, which realizes an effective photocatalyst for storing and relaying oxidation N2 by inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers under mild conditions. The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits the high N2 adsorption capacity (250.5&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1) and superior N2 oxidation performance to produce HNO3 (702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The efficient catalysis of nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing products plays a crucial role in the N economic cycle. However, weak N2 adsorption and invalid N2 activation remain two major bottlenecks in rate&#8208;determining steps, leading to low N2 fixation performance. Herein, an effective dual active sites photocatalyst of polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highlighted via altering coordination microenvironment and inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers to facilitate N2/catalyst interaction and enhance oxidation performance. MOFs create more open unsaturated metal cluster sites with unoccupied d orbital possessing Lewis acidity to accept electrons from the 3&#963;g bonding orbital of N2 for storage by combining with POMs to replace bidentate linkers. POMs act as electron sponges donating electrons to MOFs, while the holes directional flow to POMs. The hole&#8208;rich POMs with strong oxidation capacity are easily involved in oxidizing adsorbed N2. Taking UiO&#8208;66 (C48H28O32Zr6) and Mo72Fe30 ([Mo72Fe30O252(CH3COO)12{Mo2O7(H2O)}2{H2Mo2O8(H2O)}(H2O)91]&#183;150H2O) as an example, Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 shows twofold enhanced adsorption of N2 (250.5&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) than UiO&#8208;66 (122.9&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1) at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1. And, the HNO3 yield of Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 is 702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;7&#160;times and 24 times higher than UiO&#8208;66 and Mo72Fe30. This work provides reliable value for the storage and relaying artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Perovskite&#8208;Based Photodetector and Memristor for Visual Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor is designed, realizing visual perception and memory capacities. The dual&#8208;functional device exhibit excellent performance in both PD and memristor. Such a device provides new opportunities for the mimicry of human visual memory in future multifunctional application.








Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. However, the combination&#160;of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor are designed to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realizes an ultrahigh self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276&#160;mA W&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;100 (&#177;2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultrahigh on/off ratio (&#8776;105), an ultralow power consumption of 3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000&#160;s) are realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. This device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provides new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Sensing Platform Based on 2D Monoelement Germanane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;assisted fluorometric sensing platform based on CH3Ge&#8208;coated paper is developed. CH3Ge paper is suitable for sensing humidity as well as acidic and alkaline gases emitted by spoiled food to track its quality. Further, it is used for printing confidential information using a water inkjet printer and shows significant re&#8208;writability.








Abstract
Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl&#8208;functionalized germanane (CH3Ge) is developed for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Luminescence (red&#8211;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH3Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH3Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH3Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). To demonstrate real&#8208;time and on&#8208;the&#8208;spot testing, absorbed gas molecules are first precisely quantified by CH3Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH3Ge&#8208;paper&#8208;based sensor is integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. Finally, CH3Ge&#8208;based rewritable paper is applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.

&lt;p&gt;Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl-functionalized germanane (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge) is developed for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti-counterfeiting. Luminescence (red&#8211;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). To demonstrate real-time and on-the-spot testing, absorbed gas molecules are first precisely quantified by CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge-paper-based sensor is integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. Finally, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge-based rewritable paper is applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Core Electron Count as a Versatile and Accurate New Descriptor for Sorting Mechanical Properties of Diverse Transition Metal Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;electron consideration of both valence electron concentration (VEC) and core electron count (CEC) is invoked in developing a distinct VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor to sort mechanical properties of diverse transition&#8208;metal compounds with higher accuracy and versatility compared to many other commonly used descriptors. A fresh path is thus opened for rational design and optimization of these compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal light&#8208;element compounds show superb mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties, and accurate descriptors are important to sorting targeted properties among this vast class of materials. Valence electron concentration (VEC) can track broad trends of mechanical properties, but this widely used descriptor suffers low accuracy with sorted data strongly scattered along trendlines, necessitating an improved sorting strategy. Here, elastic parameters from first&#8208;principles calculations are examined for 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMN) in cubic structure and 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal diborides (TMB2) in hexagonal structure and identify core electron count (CEC) of the solvent atoms as a new descriptor. Combined with VEC, the composite VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor exhibits greatly improved ability to sort elastic parameters of distinct TMN and TMB2 compounds. Unregulated property variations under the VEC description are well&#8208;captured by CEC, which tends to enhance ductility and reduce strength at fixed VEC and rising CEC. By invoking a full&#8208;electron consideration, the VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor accounts for the impact on bonding behaviors by both core and valence electrons with much&#8208;improved accuracy and versatility in sorting mechanical properties of diverse TM compounds compared to many other commonly used descriptors, opening a fresh path for rational design and optimization of TM compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.

         <title>Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Controlling Crystallization Kinetics Simultaneously for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>

It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, eliminating I0, Pb0, and uncoordinated Pb2+ defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.








Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

A universal strategy to enhance long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing is reported, by which amorphous organic LPL materials show broader application prospects.








Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, where the luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, a universal strategy is proposed to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing a generation of materials with highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area, and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, nondestructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Achieving a Record Scintillation Performance by Micro&#8208;Doping a Heterovalent Magnetic Ion in Cs3Cu2I5 Single&#8208;Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;doping of magnetic Mn2+ ions in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal can regulate the emission of self&#8208;trapped excitons under high&#8208;energy ray excitation, solving its drawback of slow scintillation decay. This optimization makes the crystal an ideal scintillator for ultrafast, ultrabright, and low&#8208;cost scintillation with significant application prospects.








Abstract
An ultrabright, ultrafast, and low&#8208;cost ideal scintillator has been critically absent and is sorely desired in scintillation detection, but has hitherto not been found. Here, a high&#8208;quality bulk Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal scintillator with ultrahigh light yield (&#8776;95&#8239;772 photons&#160;per&#160;MeV, 137Cs &#947;&#8208;rays), excellent energy resolution (3.79%, 662&#160;keV), and ultrafast scintillation decay time (3&#160;ns, 81.5%) is reported. In mechanism, it is found that micro&#8208;doping of a heterovalent magnetic ion (at the ppm level) can effectively modulate the luminescence kinetics of self&#8208;trapped excitons in the scintillator. Compared with previous reports, the introduction of trace amounts of magnetic Mn2+ (&#8776;18.6&#160;ppm) in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal shortens the scintillation decay time by several hundred times, transforming the slow decay into an ultrafast decay. Simultaneously, the light yield is also increased about three times&#160;to the highest value so far. From the comprehensive performance of the micro&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal, these excellent scintillation properties, physical characteristics suitable for practical applications, and low&#8208;cost advantages render this single&#8208;crystal an ideal scintillator with great potential for commercialization.

From the comprehensive performance of the micro-doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:Mn single-crystal, these excellent scintillation properties, physical characteristics suitable for practical applications, and low-cost advantages render this single-crystal an ideal scintillator with great potential for commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Orally Administered Cascade Nanozyme for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Materials Project is used as a candidate database to establish a rational nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening method for multifaceted therapeutic demands for IBD. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching nanozyme, with 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold higher activity than natural superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively, and its therapeutic effectiveness is demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;inflammatory models.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of individuals worldwide annually. Enteric reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in the physiology and pathology of IBD. Nanozymes hold great promise for the treatment of IBD because of their exceptional ability to regulate redox homeostasis during ROS&#8208;related inflammation. However, the rapid development of orally administered, acid&#8208;tolerant, antioxidant nanozymes for IBD therapy is challenging. Here, a nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening strategy is established to address the multifaceted IBD treatment demands, including intrinsic stability, radioactivity, solubility, gut microbiome toxicity, biomimetic elements, intermediate frontier molecular orbitals, reaction energy barriers, negative charges, and acid tolerance. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching material from 146&#160;323 candidates, which exhibits superoxide dismutase&#8208;catalase bienzyme&#8208;like activity and is 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold more active than natural enzymes. As demonstrated in a mouse model, Ni3S4 is stable in the gastrointestinal tract without toxicity and specifically targets the diseased colon to alleviate oxidative stress. RNA and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that Ni3S4 effectively inhibits the cellular pathways of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and restores the gut microbiota. This study not develops a highly efficient orally administered cascade nanozyme for IBD therapy and offers a next&#8208;generation paradigm for the rational design of nanomedicine through data&#8208;driven approaches.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Aniline&#8208;Fused Quinonoid Units Affords Efficient Proton Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#8208;based cathode&#160;with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids for proton batteries is developed. The assembled TPAD&#8208;COF//AQ all&#8208;organic proton battery exhibits excellent cycling performance. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that both the NH and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes.








Abstract
Owing to their intrinsic safety and sustainability, aqueous proton batteries have emerged as promising energy devices. Nevertheless, the corrosion or dissolution of electrode materials in acidic electrolytes must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, a cathode material based on a redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF) with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units&#160;featuring inherently regular open porous channels and excellent stability is developed. The TPAD&#8208;COF cathode delivers a high capacity of 126 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, paired with long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 84% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both the &#8211;NH&#8211; and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the assembled punch battery consisting of a TPAD&#8208;COF//anthraquinone (AQ) all&#8208;organic system delivers a discharge capacity of 115 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 130 cycles, implying the potential application of the TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in aqueous proton batteries. This study provides a new perspective on the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance and high capacity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Bacteriochlorin Nanosheet as a Specific Pyroptosis Inducer for Robust Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheets as a specific pyroptosis inducer exhibit the ability to induce both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy to produce potent reactive oxygen species, leading to pyroptosis of primary tumors while promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity for inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases with minimal systemic side effects.








Abstract
Pyroptosis is increasingly considered a new weathervane in cancer immune therapy. However, triggering specific pyroptotic tumor cell death while preserving normal cells still remains a major challenge. Herein, a brand&#8208;new pyroptosis inducer, copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheet (Cu&#8208;TBB), is designed. The synthesized Cu&#8208;TBB can&#160;be activated to an &#8220;on&#8221; state in the tumor microenvironment with glutathione (GSH) overexpression, leading to the release of Cu+ and TBB, respectively. Intriguingly, the released Cu+ can&#160;drive cascade reactions to produce O2&#8722;&#8226; and highly toxic &#183;OH in cells. Additionally, the released TBB can&#160;also generate O2&#8722;&#8226; and 1O2 upon 750&#160;nm laser irradiation. Encouragingly, both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy pathways result in potent pyroptosis along with dendritic cell maturation and T cell priming, thus simultaneously eliminating the primary tumors and inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases. Conclusively, the well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;TBB nanosheet is shown to trigger specific pyroptosis in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo, leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Self&#8208;Assembled Hydroxyl Radical Generator Based on Photoinduced Cascade Electron Transfer for Hypoxic Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generators (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) that are activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, capable of forming nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The generation of &#8226;OH is accomplished with high efficiency through photoinduced cascade electron transfer pathways within the self&#8208;assembled molecular state. Consequently, ANOR&#8208;Cy5 exhibits exceptional efficacy in inducing photoablation of hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
The hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) is an extremely potent reactive oxygen species that plays a crucial role in photooxidations within the realm of hypoxic tumor therapy. However, the current methods for &#8226;OH photogeneration typically rely on inorganic materials that require UV/vis light excitation. Consequently, photogenerators based on organic molecules, especially those utilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation, are rare. In this study, the concept of photoinduced cascade charge transfer (PICET), which utilizes NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) to generate &#8226;OH is introduced. The ANOR&#8208;Cy5 photosensitizer, with its flexible hydrophobic structure, enables the formation of nanoparticles in aqueous solutions through molecular assembly. PICET involves a symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation&#8208;induced localized charge&#8208;separated state, transitioning to a delocalized charge&#8208;separated state, which governs the efficiency of &#8226;OH generation. Thanks to the oxygen&#8208;independent nature of &#8226;OH generation and its robust oxidative properties, the ANOR&#8208;Cy5&#8208;based photosensitizer demonstrates highly effective photoinduced anti&#8208;cancer effects, even under severely hypoxic conditions. This discovery emphasizes the potential for achieving &#8226;OH photogeneration using a single organic molecule through the engineering of molecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby opening up new possibilities for phototherapy and beyond.

Thanks to the oxygen-independent nature of &#8226;OH generation and its robust oxidative properties, the ANOR-Cy5-based photosensitizer demonstrates highly effective photoinduced anti-cancer effects, even under severely hypoxic conditions. This discovery emphasizes the potential for achieving &#8226;OH photogeneration using a single organic molecule through the engineering of molecular self-assembly, thereby opening up new possibilities for phototherapy and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibited Grain Growth Through Phase Transition Modulation Enables Excellent Mechanical Properties in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers up to 1700&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase transition modulation strategy is proposed to prepare oxide ceramic nanofibers, which are featured by inhibited grain growth at high temperatures. As a result, a strikingly high average tensile strength of 1.02&#160;GPa is achieved at 1700&#160;&#176;C, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramics for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Oxide ceramics are widely used as thermal protection materials due to their excellent structural properties and earth abundance. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), the explosive growth of grain size causes irreversible damage to the microstructure of oxide ceramics, thus exhibiting poor thermomechanical stability. This problem, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, remains a great challenge for oxide ceramic materials. Here, a novel strategy of phase transition modulation is proposed to control the grain growth at high temperatures in oxide ceramic nanofibers, realizing effective regulation of the crystalline forms as well as the size uniformity of primary grains, and thus suppressing the malignant growth of the grains. The resulting oxide ceramic nanofibers have excellent mechanical strength and flexibility, delivering an average tensile strength as high as 1.02&#160;GPa after being exposed to 1700&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min, and can withstand thousands of flexural cycles without obvious damage. This work may provide new insight into the development of advanced oxide ceramic materials that can serve in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments with long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Molecular Orbitals and Spatial Symmetry in an Optically Controlled Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry enables the optical control of two ferroelectric states between the closed&#8208;ring and open&#8208;ring forms of a photochromic organic ferroelectric, which is an unprecedented mechanism in ferroelectrics and brings a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
As particles carry quantified energy, photon radiation enables orbital transitions of energy levels, leading to changes in the spin state of electrons. The resulting switchable structural bistability may bring a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. However, the studies on molecular orbital breaking in the ferroelectric field remain blank. Here, for the first time, a new mechanism of ferroelectrics&#8212;dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry, demonstrated in a photochromic organic crystal with light&#8208;induced polarization switching, is formally proposed. By alternating the ultraviolet/visible light irradiation, the states of electron spin and the radial distribution p atomic orbitals experience a change, showing a reversible switch from &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; form to a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; form. This reflects a reversible conversion between &#960; and &#963; bonds, which induces and couples with the variation of spatial symmetry. The intersection of spatial symmetry breaking and molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics present in this work will be more conducive to data encryption and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Regulating Exciton De&#8208;Trapping of Te4+&#8208;Doped Zero&#8208;Dimensional Scandium&#8208;Halide Perovskite for Fluorescence Thermometry with Record High Time&#8208;Resolved Thermal Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive fluorescence thermometer is developed by Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O engineering. The rapid de&#8208;trapping process of self&#8208;trapped excitons induced by the soft lattice results in a record high thermal sensitivity for the lifetime&#8208;based detection, reaching up to 27.36% K&#8722;1 at 325 K, with the temperature uncertainty below 0.1 K, enabling remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components.








Abstract
Fluorescence thermometry has been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention due to its high spatial resolution and remote non&#8208;invasive detection. However, recent generations of thermometers still suffer from limited thermal sensitivity (Sr) below 10% change per Kelvin. Herein, this work presents an ideal temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence material through Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O, in which isolated polyhedrons endow highly localized electronic structures, and the strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling facilitates the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). With rising temperature, the dramatic asymmetric expansion of the soft lattice induces increased defects, strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, and low thermal activation energy, which evokes a rapid de&#8208;trapping process of STEs, enabling several orders of magnitude changes in the fluorescence lifetime over a narrow temperature range. After regulating the de&#8208;trapping process with different Te4+ doping, a record&#8208;high Sr (27.36% K&#8722;1) of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based detection is achieved at 325 K. The robust stability against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long&#8208;term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. It is believed that this work constitutes a solid step towards building the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halides.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.








Abstract
Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme&#8208;like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme&#8208;CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. These OSDs' prevention nanozyme&#8208;CCLs can pave the way for CCLs toward powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>

The oligomeric acceptors with different flexible alkyl chains (DOY&#8208;C2, DOY&#8208;C4, and TOY&#8208;C4) are synthesized. When doped into D18:N3 system, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.01% and 17.91% are achieved in rigid and flexible devices based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of ternary films are also successfully improved due to form tie and entangled chain networks.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (PD) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs are fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the PD:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs are characterized. By introducing DOA DOY&#8208;C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4&#8208;based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3&#8208;based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Driven Tribo&#8208;Electrophoresis Enabled Human&#8211;Droplet Interaction in 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel human&#8211;droplet interaction platform rooted in the TEP approach is demonstrated, eliminating the need for complex electrodes and external power sources. By employing a well&#8208;designed triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer, precise and flexible manipulation of droplets in 3D space is achieved through human motion, fostering enhanced synergy and flexibility between humans and droplets.








Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences, and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, a novel method is proposed, which&#160;leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8211;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. The approach involves the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer&#160;that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting and stable transport in the clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with freedom to move in three dimensions but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8211;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase perovskite BDASnI4 is identified to be promising for constructing high&#8211;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). By developing interface and additive engineering strategies, BDASnI4 FETs achieve mobility of 1.61 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Moreover, the devices remain functional after being exposed to ambient conditions (temperature of 45 &#8451; and humidity of 45%) for over 150 h.&#160; 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites hold immense potential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the instability of perovskite&#8208;based transistors has impeded their progress and practical applications. Here, ambient&#8208;stable high&#8208;performance FETs based on 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase tin halide perovskite BDASnI4, which has high film quality and excellent electrical properties, are reported. The perovskite channels are established by engineering the film crystallization process via the employment of ammonium salt interlayers and the incorporation of NH4SCN additives within the precursor solution. The refined FETs demonstrate field&#8208;effect hole mobilities up to 1.61 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio surpassing 106. Moreover, the devices show impressive operational and environmental stability and retain their functional performance even after being exposed to ambient conditions with a temperature of 45 &#176;C and humidity of 45% for over 150 h.

         <title>Fast Gas&#8208;Adsorption Kinetics in Supraparticle&#8208;Based MOF Packings with Hierarchical Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#160;adsorbents with a multilevel hierarchical pore structure consisting of interconnected pore networks at three distinct length scales (&gt;1000, &#8776;100, and &#8776;1 nm) exhibit efficient mass transport. These materials can be self&#8208;assembled using supraparticles formed with nanoscale ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles as intermediate building blocks and exhibit 30 times faster adsorption kinetics compared to their unstructured analogs.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high&#8208;throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this work, this problem is addressed by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle&#8208;based approach. Spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles are fabricated by emulsion templating and they are used as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) particles are used as a model system and the gas&#8208;adsorption kinetics of the hierarchical material are compared with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. It is demonstrated that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate compared to an unstructured ZIF&#8208;8 powder pellet. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials. In the hierarchical MOFs, large macropores between the supraparticles, smaller macropores between individual ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles, and micropores inherent to the ZIF&#8208;8 framework collude to combine large surface area, defined adsorption sites, and efficient mass transport to enhance performance.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond Reconfiguration of Ferroelectric Domains in Bismuth Ferrite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pulsed photoexcitation, multiferroic bismuth ferrite thin film exhibits a sub&#8208;nanosecond melting of their periodic stripe domains. The disordered domains recover back to their original state over few nanosecond timescale. The ultrafast manipulation of domains can be used for fast speed operation in applications of ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Domain switching is crucial for achieving desired functions in ferroic materials that are used in various applications. Fast control of domains at sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales remains a challenge despite its potential for high&#8208;speed operation in random&#8208;access memories, photonic, and nanoelectronic devices. Here, ultrafast laser excitation is shown to transiently melt and reconfigure ferroelectric stripe domains in multiferroic bismuth ferrite on a timescale faster than 100&#160;picoseconds.

     alt="Sub-Nanosecond Reconfiguration of Ferroelectric Domains in Bismuth Ferrite"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon pulsed photoexcitation, multiferroic bismuth ferrite thin film exhibits a sub-nanosecond melting of their periodic stripe domains. The disordered domains recover back to their original state over few nanosecond timescale. The ultrafast manipulation of domains can be used for fast speed operation in applications of ferroelectrics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain switching is crucial for achieving desired functions in ferroic materials that are used in various applications. Fast control of domains at sub-nanosecond timescales remains a challenge despite its potential for high-speed operation in random-access memories, photonic, and nanoelectronic devices. Here, ultrafast laser excitation is shown to transiently melt and reconfigure ferroelectric stripe domains in multiferroic bismuth ferrite on a timescale faster than 100&#160;picoseconds. This dynamic behavior is visualized by picosecond- and nanometer-resolved X-ray diffraction and time-resolved X-ray diffuse scattering. The disordering of stripe domains is attributed to the screening of depolarization fields by photogenerated carriers resulting in the formation of charged domain walls, as supported by phase-field simulations. Furthermore, the recovery of disordered domains exhibits subdiffusive growth on nanosecond timescales, with a non-equilibrium domain velocity reaching up to 10&#160;m&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings present a new approach to image and manipulate ferroelectric domains on sub-nanosecond timescales, which can be further extended into other complex photoferroic systems to modulate their electronic, optical, and magnetic properties beyond gigahertz frequencies. This approach could pave the way for high-speed ferroelectric data storage and computing, and, more broadly, defines new approaches for visualizing the non-equilibrium dynamics of heterogeneous and disordered materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction of (Fe,Ni)OOH via Defect Engineering for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis Under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst is prepared through an energy&#8208;saving cation exchange method. It exhibits good catalytic durability and structural stability for large&#8208;scale alkaline water oxidation under industrial conditions. When coupled with NiMoN and assembled in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH&#8208;NiMoN pair shows outstanding overall water electrolysis performance.








Abstract
Developing non&#8208;precious catalysts with long&#8208;term catalytic durability and structural stability under industrial conditions is the key to practical alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. Here, an energy&#8208;saving approach is proposed to synthesize defect&#8208;rich iron nickel oxyhydroxide for stability and efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from in situ cation exchange, the nanosheet&#8208;nanoflake&#8208;structured catalyst is homogeneously embedded in, and tightly bonded to, its substrate, making it ultrastable at high current densities. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the introduction of Ni in FeOOH reduces the activation energy barrier for the catalytic reaction and that the purposely created oxygen defects not only ensure the exposure of active sites and maximize the effective catalyst surface but also modulate the local coordination environment and chemisorption properties of both Fe and Ni sites, thus lowering the energy barrier from *O to *OOH. Consequently, the optimized d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with long&#8208;term durability under both laboratory and industrial conditions. The large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH||NiMoN pair requires 1.795&#160;V to reach a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an absolute current of 12.5 A in an AEM electrolyzer for overall water electrolysis, showing great potential for industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Liquids with High Compressibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional liquids are barely compressible. However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.








Abstract
Compressibility is a fundamental property of all materials. For fluids, that is, gases and liquids, compressibility forms the basis of technologies such as pneumatics and hydraulics and determines basic phenomena such as the propagation of sound and shock waves. In contrast to gases, liquids are almost incompressible. If the compressibility of liquids could be increased and controlled, new applications in hydraulics and shock absorption could result. Here, it is shown that dispersing hydrophobic porous particles into water gives aqueous suspensions with much greater compressibilities than any normal liquids such as water (specifically, up to 20 times greater over certain pressure ranges). The increased compressibility results from water molecules being forced into the hydrophobic pores of the particles under applied pressure. The degree of compression can be controlled by varying the amount of porous particles added. Also, the pressure range of compression can be reduced by adding methanol or increased by adding salt. In all cases, the liquids expand back to their original volume when the applied pressure is released. The approach shown here is simple and economical and could potentially be scaled up to give large amounts of highly compressible liquids.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte is developed to realize cycle&#8208;stable Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with fast kinetics. Polyanionic hydrogel with high zincophilicity uniformizes Zn2+ flux and retards polyiodides/SO42&#8211; transport, leading to a dendrite&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;free Zn anode. Iodophilic polycationic hydrogel alleviates the shuttling of polyiodides and boosts the reaction kinetics at hydrogel/carbon interface for iodine species.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (ZIB) are regarded as a promising energy storage candidate. However, soluble polyiodide shuttling and rampant Zn dendrite growth hamper its commercial implementation. Herein, a hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel is designed as the electrolyte for ZIBs. On the cathode side, iodophilic polycationic hydrogel (PCH) effectively alleviates the shuttle effect and facilitates the redox kinetics of iodine species. Meanwhile, polyanionic hydrogel (PAH) toward Zn metal anode uniformizes Zn2+ flux and prevents surface corrosion by electrostatic repulsion of polyiodides. Consequently, the Zn symmetric cells with PAH electrolyte demonstrate remarkable cycling stability over 3000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (1 mAh cm&#8211;2) and 800&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (5 mAh cm&#8211;2). Moreover, the Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with PAH&#8208;PCH hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte deliver a low&#8208;capacity decay of 0.008 &#8240; per cycle during 18&#160;000 cycles at 8 C. This work sheds light on hydrogel electrolytes design for long&#8208;life conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.

         <title>Activating Selenium Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>

Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se (abbreviated as &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se) is successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal method for advanced cathodes of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs). Benefiting from synergistic doping and amorphization strategy, the resulting &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se||Zn battery displays record&#8208;high capacity and exceptional cyclability. Such novel electrode chemistry of &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se with both intercalation/deintercalation and deposition/stripping mechanisms opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation ARZIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs) are a promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage device by virtue of the superior safety and low cost of both the aqueous electrolyte and zinc&#8208;metal anode. However, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can provide both lightweight and compact size. Herein, a novel cathode chemistry based on amorphous Se doped with transition metal Ru that mitigates the resistive surface layer produced by the side reactions between the Se cathode and aqueous electrolyte is reported. This improvement can permit high volumetric capacity in this system. Distinct from the conventional conversion mechanisms between Se and ZnSe in Se||Zn cells, this strategy realizes synchronous proton and Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation in the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells. Moreover, an unanticipated Zn2+ deposition/stripping process in this system further contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of this new cathode chemistry. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells are found to deliver a record&#8208;high capacity of 721&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1/3472&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, and superior cycling stability of over 800 cycles with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle. This reported work opens the door for new chemistries that can further improve the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of ARZIBs.

Such novel electrode chemistry of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.14&lt;/sub&gt;Se with both intercalation/deintercalation and deposition/stripping mechanisms opens new opportunities for next-generation ARZIBs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ARZIBs) are a promising next-generation energy-storage device by virtue of the superior safety and low cost of both the aqueous electrolyte and zinc-metal anode. However, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can provide both lightweight and compact size. Herein, a novel cathode chemistry based on amorphous Se doped with transition metal Ru that mitigates the resistive surface layer produced by the side reactions between the Se cathode and aqueous electrolyte is reported. This improvement can permit high volumetric capacity in this system. Distinct from the conventional conversion mechanisms between Se and ZnSe in Se||Zn cells, this strategy realizes synchronous proton and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation/deintercalation in the Ru-doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells. Moreover, an unanticipated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition/stripping process in this system further contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of this new cathode chemistry. Consequently, the Ru-doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells are found to deliver a record-high capacity of 721&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/3472&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and superior cycling stability of over 800 cycles with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle. This reported work opens the door for new chemistries that can further improve the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of ARZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads with Flexible Spacers: Deciphering Complex Photophysics for Targeted Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads are deciphered for practical use in materials science. In solution, fluorescent exciplexes are formed only for the short spacer (n = 4). Upon freezing, emissive static charge transfer (CT) complexes are formed for all spacer lengths. The molecular solids are stimuli&#8208;responsive, showing on/off fluorescence switching (n &gt; 4) or change of the emission color (n = 4).








Abstract
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads with varying flexible spacer lengths (n = 4&#8211;10 carbon atoms) are investigated in liquid and solid solution, as well as in crystals, by steady&#8208;state and transient fluorescence spectroscopy combined with computational studies. For the short spacer (n = 4) in a liquid solution, dynamic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state formation with subsequent, efficient exciplex emission is observed, effectively competing with quenching through electron transfer (eT) via a radical ion pair. In a solid solution, a fluorescent CT static complex is formed upon freezing for all spacer lengths. This allows the observations of a former seminal report on stimuli&#8208;responsive high&#8208;contrast fluorescence on/off switching in films of the triads to be reassigned (Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 5487), now providing a holistic picture on varying spacer length. In fact, external stimuli of the film by modulating the geometry of the CT complex, which results in on/off fluorescence switching (for n &gt; 4) or in a change of the emission color (n = 4). The work thus demonstrates how in&#8208;depth analysis of complex photophysics can be put to practical use in materials science.

         <title>Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of Au/Co dual single atom (DSA) loaded CdS for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A reversed electron transfer mechanism is confirmed for this Au/Co DSA that leads to localized electrons around Co, and delocalized electrons from Au. This boosts electron transfer and CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction leading to a highly significant increase in reduction.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO2 photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts is reported. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated electrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts, however, electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO2 molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO2 reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &#8776;2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH4 compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO2. Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in DSA&#8208;loaded catalysts for the generation of solar fuels.

         <title>Unleashing the Full Potential of Photo&#8208;Driven CO&#160;Hydrogenation to Light Olefins over Carbon&#8208;Coated CoMn&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light for converting syngas to light olefins. Through the coupling of photo&#8208;thermocatalysis and photocatalysis (between MnO and Co with carbon mediation), the catalyst unleashes the full potential of a photodriven reaction, achieving 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermal catalysis.








Abstract
As a nonpetroleum process, photodriven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis provides a practical approach for the synthesis of light olefins. However, maximizing the solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency based on the design of the composite catalyst and understanding the catalytic mechanism remain challenging. Herein, a novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed for the efficient conversion of syngas to light olefins under light irradiation. The CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst exhibits a CO conversion of 12.6% with a selectivity to light olefins of 36.5% under light irradiation, showing 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermocatalysis. Experimental characterizations as certain the CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst can be excited to generate photogenerated carriers under light irradiation and then the electron transfer to metallic Co to form electron&#8208;rich active sites with carbon mediation, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculation based on density functional theory reveal the unique roles of photogenerated carriers in promoting the adsorption and activation of CO molecules. This study demonstrates a feasible catalyst model to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light to produce the value&#8208;added chemical.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases and Hyaluronan Synthase: A Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal dual&#8208;bionic nanozyme (MPMP), mimicking antioxidases and hyaluronan synthase, is developed for effective osteoarthritis (OA) therapy, which can produce heat, scavenge free radical and promote chondrogenesis even if under inflammatory conditions. This nanozyme regulates anabolic and catabolic processes simultaneously, thereby restoring joint homeostasis effectively and demonstrating an admirable photothermally therapeutic&#160; effect on OA.








Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8208;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, a dual&#8208;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) is constructed to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowers the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8208;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contribute to eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;2&#8211;/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF&#8208;&#954;B/IL&#8208;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8208;NIR shows HAS&#8208;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12&#8208;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8208;NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70&#8208;fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8208;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

The antioxidases-mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contribute to eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/&#183;OH/O&lt;sup&gt;&#183;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;/DPPH/ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and supplying O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF-&#954;B/IL-17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, MPMP-NIR shows HAS-mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12-fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP-NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70-fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual-bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergizing Spatial Confinement and Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysis to Boost Sulfur Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Fish&#8208;in&#8208;net&#8221; encapsulation of sulfur nanoparticles in an ordered metal&#8211;organic framework is reported as an efficient strategy for overcoming the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This approach results in long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption, and decent multistep catalytic conversion, thereby significantly improving the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and sulfur conversion rate.








Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues can enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2 C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor deposition method in combination with a solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization technique is presented to fabricate high&#8208;quality larger&#8208;area perovskite film. Efficiency of 19.9% is achieved, which is among the highest values ever reported for minimodules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

         <title>Identifying a Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal activity descriptor (orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy) is successfully extracted from various materials&#8217; physicochemical properties for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions in multiple electrolytes. Systematic experiments and computations reveal the life&#8208;cycle HER and OER mechanisms and identify the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory as a powerful mechanism analysis tool and foundation.








Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) is not yet developed. Moreover, a unifying concept is not yet established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over ten representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides are rationally bridged through statistical methodologies. The orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8776;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in the OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in the HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in the OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>A General Strategy for Developing Ultrasensitive &#8220;Transistor&#8208;Like&#8221; Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;engineering strategy based on rational design and selection of fluorophores and phase&#8208;change molecules to construct color&#8208;independent thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) with ultrasensitive thermoresponsive fluorescence switching, high brightness, and superior reversibility and stability to the heating&#8211;cooling cycle is reported. By using these TFMs, a thermo&#8208;controllable multilevel information encryption/decryption is achieved within 10&#160;K temperature change.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) exhibit great potential in information encryption applications but are limited by low thermosensitivity, poor color tunability, and a wide temperature&#8208;responsive range. Herein, a novel strategy for constructing highly sensitive TFMs with tunable emission (450&#8211;650&#160;nm) toward multilevel information encryption is proposed, which employs polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrixes. The structure&#8211;function relationships between the performance of TFMs and the structures of both fluorescent emitters and phase&#8208;change molecules are systematically studied. Benefiting from the above design, the obtained TFMs exhibit over 9500&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement toward the temperature change, as well as ultrahigh relative temperature sensitivity up to 80%&#160;K&#8722;1, which are first confirmed. Thanks to the superior transducing performance, the above&#8208;prepared TFMs can be further developed as information&#8208;storage platforms within a relatively narrow interval of temperature variation, including temperature&#8208;dominated multicolored information display and multilevel information encryption. This work will not only provide a novel perspective for designing superior TFMs for information encryption but also bring inspiration to the design and preparation of other response&#8208;switching&#8208;type fluorescent probes with ultrahigh conversion efficiency.

         <title>Beyond Rattling: Tetrahedrites as Incipient Ionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tetrahedrite, copper ions are mobile at temperatures of 200&#160;K or above, but confined to cages within the crystal structure. The localized diffusional jumps of the copper ions within a confined octahedral environment are effective at suppressing thermal conduction. This work reveals that tetrahedrite behaves as an incipient ionic conductor.








Abstract
Materials with ultralow thermal conductivity are crucial to many technological applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, thermal barrier coatings, and optoelectronics. Liquid&#8208;like mobile ions are effective at disrupting phonon propagation, hence suppressing thermal conduction. However, high ionic mobility leads to the degradation of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric materials under operating conditions due to ion migration and metal deposition at the cathode, hindering their practical application. Here, a new type of behavior, incipient ionic conduction, which leads to ultralow thermal conductivity, while overcoming the issues of degradation inherent in liquid&#8208;like materials, is identified. Using neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is demonstrated that in tetrahedrite, an established thermoelectric material with a remarkably low thermal conductivity, copper ions,&#160;although mobile above 200 K, are predominantly confined to cages within the crystal structure. Hence the undesirable migration of cations to the cathode can be avoided. These findings unveil a new approach for the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity, by exploring systems in which incipient ionic conduction may be present.

Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials
In article number 2305472, Xiaobo Zhou, Yuling Qin, Li Wu, and co&#8208;workers present a comprehensive approach for the development of highly sensitive thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) suitable for multilevel information encryption. They employ polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with D&#8211;A&#8211;D type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrices. Thanks to this well&#8208;designed strategy, the resulting TFMs exhibit remarkable fluorescence enhancements within relatively narrow range of temperature variations.

Circularly Polarized Luminescence
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is the emission of left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helical light, and a key property of certain chiral materials with applications such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. In article number 2302279 by Sascha Feldmann and co&#8208;workers, the fundamentals, advances, pitfalls and software for accurately measuring CPL are described.

Extracellular Vesicles
Extracellular vesicles have emerged as therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. However, current techniques for their isolation are relatively inefficient. In article number 2212000, Jean&#8208;Christophe Leroux and co&#8208;workers report the development of a novel electrochemical device with affinity&#8208;based capturing for the rapid isolation of extracellular vesicles from biosamples and their further purification after loading with exogenous compounds.

Stretchable Electronics
In article number 2303458, Dae&#8208;Hyeong Kim and co&#8208;workers report how when a nanocomposite solution is solidified in high humidity, nanowires self&#8208;assemble into bundles, resulting in a highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposite. The nanocomposite is then cut into a serpentine&#8208;shaped wearable thermostimulation device and applied to the wrist.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) as emerging carbon nanomaterials have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability.

Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as emerging carbon nanomaterials, have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability. In the last few years, despite remarkable progress achieved in CD&#8208;based LEDs, their device performance is still inferior to that of well&#8208;developed organic, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based QDs, and perovskite LEDs. To better exploit LED applications and boost device performance, in this review, a comprehensive overview of currently explored CDs is presented, focusing on their key optical characteristics, which are closely related to the structural design of CDs from their carbon core to surface modifications, and to macroscopic structural engineering, including the embedding of CDs in the matrix or spatial arrangement of CDs. The design of CD&#8208;based LEDs for display and lighting applications based on the fluorescence, phosphorescence, and delayed fluorescence emission of CDs is also highlighted. Finally, it is concluded with a discussion regarding the key challenges and plausible prospects in this field. It is hoped that this review inspires more extensive research on CDs from a new perspective and promotes practical applications of CD&#8208;based LEDs in multiple directions of current and future research.

A comprehensive overview of the emerging perovskite&#8208;solar&#8208;cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical device, including the configuration design, key parameters, working principle, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations, is highlighted. The existing challenges and future perspectives are provided for the ongoing research in this promising field.








Abstract
Metal halide hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention over the past decade owing to their potential for low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processable, earth&#8208;abundant, and high&#8208;performance superiority, increasing power conversion efficiencies of up to 25.7%. Solar energy conversion into electricity is highly efficient and sustainable, but direct utilization, storage, and poor energy diversity are difficult to achieve, resulting in a potential waste of resources. Considering its convenience and feasibility, converting solar energy into chemical fuels is regarded as a promising pathway for boosting energy diversity and expanding its utilization. In addition, the energy conversion&#8211;storage integrated system can efficiently sequentially capture, convert, and store energy in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a comprehensive overview focusing on PSC&#8208;self&#8208;driven integrated devices with a discussion of their development and limitations remains lacking. Here, focus is on the development of representative configurations of emerging PSC&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical devices including self&#8208;charging power packs, unassisted solar water splitting/CO2 reduction. The advanced progresses in this field, including configuration design, key parameters, working principles, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations are also summarized. Finally, scientific challenges and future perspectives for ongoing research in this field are presented.

Ternary copper halides (TCHs) have generated considerable attention for the exceptional structure diversity and fascinating optoelectronic properties. The recent advances of currently explored TCHs are systemically summarized, regarding the crystal and electronic structure, synthesis strategy, photophysical mechanism, luminescence regulation, environmental stability, and their emerging applications. Moreover, current existing challenges and possible development directions are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Recently, the newly&#8208;emerging lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskite counterparts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the newly-emerging lead-free metal-halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead-based perovskite counterparts. Among them, ternary copper halides (TCHs) have become a vital group due to their unique features, including abundant structural diversity, ease of synthesis, unprecedented optoelectronic properties, high abundance, and low cost. Although the recent efforts in this field have made certain progresses, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Herein, a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of recent progress on the fundamental characteristics of TCH materials and their versatile applications is presented, which contains topics such as: i) crystal and electronic structure features and synthesis strategies; ii) mechanisms of self-trapped excitons, luminescence regulation, and environmental stability; and iii) their burgeoning optoelectronic devices of phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs), electroluminescent LEDs, anti-counterfeiting, X-ray scintillators, photodetectors, sensors, and memristors. Finally, the current challenges together with future perspectives on the development of TCH materials and applications are also critically described, which is considered to be critical for accelerating the commercialization of these rapidly evolving technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
