         <title>3D Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Insulator&#8211;Metal&#8211;Insulator Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) based on a g&#8208;C3N4 layer, which possesses high structural and compositional homogeneity, is proposed to guide conformal Li deposition in the van der Waals gap between graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4. The design of a 3D artificial SEI enables stable cycling of Li metal anodes and provides potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Despite considerable efforts to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite growth, stable cycling of Li metal anodes with various structures remains extremely difficult due to the direct contact of the liquid electrolyte with Li. Rational design of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for 3D electrodes is a promising but still challenging strategy for preventing Li dendrite growth and avoiding lithium&#8211;electrolyte side reactions in Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a 3D architecture is constructed with g&#8208;C3N4/graphene/g&#8208;C3N4 insulator&#8211;metal&#8211;insulator sandwiched nanosheets to guide uniform Li plating/stripping in the van der Waals gap between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, and the function of which can be regarded as a 3D artificial SEI. Li deposition on the surface of g&#8208;C3N4 is suppressed due to its insulating nature. However, its uniform lithiophilic sites and nanopore channels enable homogeneous lithium plating between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, prohibiting the direct contact of the electrolyte with the Li metal. The use of the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;layer&#8208;modified 3D anode enables long&#8208;term Li deposition with a high Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling of full cells under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. The concept of a 3D artificial SEI will shed light on developing safe and stable Li&#8208;metal anodes.

Abstract
Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for understanding and tuning cell behaviors, which plays a critical role in cell&#8208;based therapy. Here, a facile yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings is reported. By simply co&#8208;depositing with dopamine under a cytocompatible condition, various functional small molecules and polymers can be encoded to form a multifunctional coating on a cell's surface. The accessibility and versatility of this method to decorate diverse cells, including bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells is demonstrated. With the ability to tune surface functions, ligand co&#8208;deposited gut microbiota is prepared as oral therapeutics for targeted treatment of colitis. Given the dual cytoprotective and targeting effects of the coating, decorated cells show more than 30&#8208;times higher bioavailability in the gut and fourfold higher accumulation in the inflamed tissue in comparison with those of uncoated bacteria. Multimodal therapeutic cells further validate strikingly increased treatment efficacy over clinical aminosalicylic acid in colitis mice. Decorating with multifunctional coatings proposes a robust platform for developing multimodal cells for enhanced cell&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Engineering the Optical Emission and Robustness of Metal&#8208;Halide Layered Perovskites through Ligand Accommodation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic component in 2D layered perovskites can grant access to many possibilities for material design, in view of the rich variety. This work shows how the choice of the structure and chain length of organic cations can effectively guide the precise design of the emission color and efficiency of such versatile nanomaterials.








Abstract
The unique combination of organic and inorganic layers in 2D layered perovskites offers promise for the design of a variety of materials for mechatronics, flexoelectrics, energy conversion, and lighting. However, the potential tailoring of their properties through the organic building blocks is not yet well understood. Here, different classes of organoammonium molecules are exploited to engineer the optical emission and robustness of a new set of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper metal&#8208;halide layered perovskites. It is shown that the type of molecule regulates the number of hydrogen bonds that it forms with the edge&#8208;sharing [PbBr6]4&#8208; octahedra layers, leading to strong differences in the material emission and tunability of the color coordinates, from deep&#8208;blue to pure&#8208;white. Also, the emission intensity strongly depends on the length of the molecules, thereby providing an additional parameter to optimize their emission efficiency. The combined experimental and computational study provides a detailed understanding of the impact of lattice distortions, compositional defects, and the anisotropic crystal structure on the emission of such layered materials. It is foreseen that this rational design can be extended to other types of organic linkers, providing a yet unexplored path to tailor the optical and mechanical properties of these materials and to unlock new functionalities.

A plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods through manganese dioxide coating is explored for activatable photoacoustic/magnetic resonance duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemodynamic therapy in the second near&#8208;infrared window.








Abstract
Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO2) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO2) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO2@MnO2 (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO2 layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO2 layer. Additionally, the MnO2 layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn2+ ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy. This plasmonic modulation strategy can be adapted to other metal nanomaterials and the construction of a new class of NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostics.

         <title>Degradable Poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Plastics with High Mechanical Strength in a Watery Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely degradable and easily processable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based supramolecular plastics are fabricated by complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA, hydrophobic humic acid, and Fe3+ ions. In watery environments, the plastics have a mechanical strength similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. The PVA&#8208;based plastics can completely degrade into nontoxic species after being placed under soil for approximately 108 d.








Abstract
It is challenging to fabricate degradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based plastics that can be used in watery environments because PVA is soluble in water. In this study, PVA&#8208;based supramolecular plastics with excellent degradability in soil and high mechanical strength in watery environments are fabricated by the complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA (VPVA), hydrophobic humic acid (HA), and Fe3+ ions (hereafter denoted as VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes). Large&#8208;area PVA&#8208;based plastics can be easily prepared from a solution of VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes using a blade&#8208;coating method. The high&#8208;density of hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, as well as the reinforcement of self&#8208;assembled Fe3+&#8208;chelated HA nanoparticles, facilitate the fabrication of PVA&#8208;based plastics with a breaking strength of &#8776;85.0&#160;MPa. After immersion in water at room temperature for 7 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics exhibit a breaking strength of &#8776;26.2&#160;MPa, which is similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. Furthermore, owing to the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, the VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe plastics are recyclable and can be conveniently processed into plastic products with desired shapes. After being placed under soil for &#8776;108 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics are completely degraded into nontoxic species without requiring manual interference.

         <title>Water&#8211;Salt Oligomers Enable Supersoluble Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;salt oligomers break through the physical solubility limits of aqueous electrolytes, enabling high&#8208;capacity rechargeable batteries based on zinc&#8211;halogen chemistry. The polymer&#8208;like characters of such electrolytes are confirmed by relatively large molecular&#8208;ion peaks and low glass&#8208;transition temperatures. In situ electrochemical technologies reveal a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into the graphene cathode during charging, accounting for the high capacity of the assembled batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are highly safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly, but restricted by low energy density. One of the most efficient solutions is to improve the concentration of the aqueous electrolytes. However, each salt is limited by its physical solubility, generally below 21&#8211;32&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 (m). Here, a ZnCl2/ZnBr2/Zn(OAc)2 aqueous electrolyte with a record super&#8208;solubility up to 75 m is reported, which breaks through the physical solubility limit. This is attributed to the formation of acetate&#8208;capped water&#8211;salt oligomers bridged by Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;&#8208;H and Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/O&#8208;Zn2+ interactions. Mass spectrometry indicates that acetate anions containing nonpolarized protons prohibit the overgrowth and precipitation of ionic oligomers. The polymer&#8208;like glass transition temperature of such inorganic electrolytes is found at &#8776;&#8722;70 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, without the observation of peaks for salt&#8208;crystallization and water&#8208;freezing from 40 to &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.

         <title>Analysis of External and Internal Disorder to Understand Band&#8208;Like Transport in n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular vibrations govern the charge transport in organic semiconductors, which is limited by different sources of disorder. Understanding and mastering the disorder in these materials can drive the design of better semiconductors featuring band&#8208;like transport.








Abstract
Charge transport in organic semiconductors is notoriously extremely sensitive to the presence of disorder, both internal and external (i.e., related to interactions with the dielectric layer), especially for n&#8208;type materials. Internal dynamic disorder stems from large thermal fluctuations both in intermolecular transfer integrals and (molecular) site energies in weakly interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient localization of the charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive transient localization typically operate at low&#8208;frequency (&lt;a&#8208;few&#8208;hundred cm&#8722;1), which makes it difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this has prevented the identification of clear molecular design rules to control and reduce dynamic disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be external, being controlled by the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here a comprehensive study of charge transport in two closely related n&#8208;type molecular organic semiconductors using a combination of temperature&#8208;dependent inelastic neutron scattering and photoelectron spectroscopy corroborated by electrical measurements, theory, and simulations is reported. Unambiguous evidence that ad hoc molecular design enables the electron charge carriers to be freed from both internal and external disorder to ultimately reach band&#8208;like electron transport is provided.

         <title>An Organodiselenide Comediator to Facilitate Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator, which endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance, remarkable cycling stability, and high actual energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under practical pouch cell conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, where soluble lithium polysulfides are crucial in the Li&#8211;S electrochemistry as intrinsic redox mediators. However, the poor mediation capability of the intrinsic polysulfide mediators leads to sluggish redox kinetics, further rendering limited rate performances, low discharge capacity, and rapid capacity decay. Here, an organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator. DPDSe spontaneously reacts with lithium polysulfides to generate lithium phenylseleno polysulfides (LiPhSePSs) with improved redox mediation capability. The as&#8208;generated LiPhSePSs afford faster sulfur redox kinetics and increase the deposition dimension of lithium sulfide. Consequently, the DPDSe comediator endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance of 817&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 2 C and remarkable cycling stability with limited anode excess. Moreover, Li&#8211;S pouch cells with the DPDSe comediator achieve an actual initial energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 30 stable cycles. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy with an effective organodiselenide comediator to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under pouch cell conditions and inspires further exploration in mediating Li&#8211;S kinetics for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

Platinum (Pt) single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging. A route of cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms is reported, which improves the Pt mass activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution significantly.








Abstract
The platinum single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging because the size issue of Pt is approached at the ultimate ceiling as single atoms. Here, a new route for further improving Pt catalytic efficiency by cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, which contains a fraction of nonbonding oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimers, is reported. These Co&#8211;Pt dimer sites originate from loading high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atoms and Co single&#8208;atoms, with them anchoring randomly on the TiO2 substrate. This dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and external quantum efficiency of &#8776;83.4% at 365&#160;nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single&#8208;atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding. Namely, the &#8220;mute&#8221; Co single&#8208;atom is activated by Pt single&#8208;atom and the activity of the Pt atom is further enhanced through the dimer interaction. This strategy of nonbonding interactive dimer sites and the oxygen&#8208;mediated catalytic mechanisms provide emerging rich opportunities for greatly improving the catalytic efficiency and developing novel catalysts with creating new electronic states.

         <title>Stable and Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater Enabled by an Unsaturated Nickel Surface Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsaturated nickel surface nitride exhibits efficient and stable performance for hydrogen evolution from seawater. The origin of the activity and stability of the unique surface nitride is investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. By coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode, a flow&#8208;electrolyzer is assembled that can deliver a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a small cell voltage of 0.7&#160;V.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic production of hydrogen from seawater provides a route to low&#8208;cost and clean energy conversion. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using seawater is greatly hindered by the lack of active and stable catalysts. Herein, an unsaturated nickel surface nitride (Ni&#8208;SN@C) catalyst that is active and stable for the HER in alkaline seawater is prepared. It achieves a low overpotential of 23&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater electrolyte, which is superior to Pt/C. Compared to conventional transition metal nitrides or metal/metal nitride heterostructures, the Ni&#8208;SN@C has no detectable bulk nickel nitride phase. Instead, unsaturated Ni&#63743;N bonding on the surface is present. In situ Raman measurements show that the Ni&#8208;SN@C performs like Pt with the ability to generate hydronium ions in a high&#8208;pH electrolyte. The catalyst operation is then demonstrated in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer system, coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode. Using this system, a cell voltage of only 0.7&#160;V is required to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Scalable Superior Chemical Sensing Performance of Stretchable Ionotronic Skin via a &#960;&#8208;Hole Receptor Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable chemical sensor showing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and even scalability is demonstrated, which is termed an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker. Ultimately, the proposed strategy is expected to provide new guidelines for sensing channels for next&#8208;generation wearable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable gas sensors provide a next&#8208;generation wearable platform for real&#8208;time protection of human health by monitoring environmental and physiological chemicals. However, the creation of skin&#8208;like wearable gas sensors, possessing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and scalability (4S) simultaneously, has been a big challenge. Here, an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker (IGS) is demonstrated, implemented with free&#8208;standing polymer electrolyte (ionic thermoplastic polyurethane, i&#8208;TPU) as a sensing channel and inkjet&#8208;printed stretchable carbon nanotube electrodes, which enables the IGS to exhibit high sensitivity, selectivity, stability (against mechanical stress, humidity, and temperature), and scalable fabrication, simultaneously. The IGS demonstrates reliable sensing capability against nitrogen dioxide molecules under not only harsh mechanical stress (cyclic bending with the radius of curvature of 1 mm and cyclic straining at 50%), but also environmental conditions (thermal aging from &#8722;45 to 125 &#176;C for 1000 cycles and humidity aging for 24 h at 85% relative humidity). Further, through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, a &#960;&#8208;hole receptor mechanism is proposed, which can effectively elucidate the origin of the high sensitivity (up to parts per billion level) and selectivity of the ionotronic sensing system. Consequently, this work provides a guideline for the design of ionotronic materials for the achievement of high&#8208;performance and skin&#8208;attachable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting Enabled by Tuning the Hydration Entropy in an Electrochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature coefficient is optimized by tuning the hydration entropy during cation intercalation with Prussian blue analogues. A high thermal energy conversion efficiency of 50% Carnot efficiency is obtained in the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle in the very low temperature range of 10&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C. This demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.








Abstract
Harvesting of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is promising, but its application is hampered by a lack of efficient and low&#8208;cost systems. The thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a potential alternative system with high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Here, the temperature coefficient (&#945;), which is a key factor in a TREC, is studied by tuning the hydration entropy of the electrochemical reaction. The change of &#945; in copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) with intercalation of different monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and a larger &#945; value of &#8722;1.004&#160;mV K&#8722;1 being found in the Rb+ system are observed. With a view to practical application, a full cell is constructed for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. The resultant &#951;e is 4.34% when TREC operates between 10 and 50&#160;&#176;C, which further reaches 6.21% when 50% heat recuperation is considered. This efficiency equals to 50% of the Carnot efficiency, which is thought to be the highest &#951;e reported for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing the TREC, and the demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.

         <title>Layered Heterostructure Ionogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared to ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Ionogel electrolytes based on ionic liquids and gelling matrices offer several advantages for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, including nonflammability, wide processing compatibility, and favorable electrochemical and thermal properties. However, the absence of ionic liquids that are concurrently stable at low and high potentials constrains the electrochemical windows of ionogel electrolytes and thus their high&#8208;energy&#8208;density applications. Here, ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are introduced, combining high&#8208;potential (anodic stability: &gt;5&#160;V vs Li/Li+) and low&#8208;potential (cathodic stability: &lt;0&#160;V vs Li/Li+) imidazolium ionic liquids in a hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelet matrix. These layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes lead to extended electrochemical windows, while preserving high ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature). Using the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes, full&#8208;cell solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries with a nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite anode are demonstrated, exhibiting voltages that are unachievable with either the high&#8208;potential or low&#8208;potential ionic liquid alone. Compared to ionogel electrolytes based on mixed ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes enable higher stability operation of full&#8208;cell lithium&#8208;ion batteries, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>A Nanoformulation&#8208;Mediated Multifunctional Stem Cell Therapy with Improved Beta&#8208;Amyloid Clearance and Neural Regeneration for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoformulation&#8208;mediated multifunctional stem cell therapy is developed for Alzheimer's disease treatment with improved beta&#8208;amyloid clearance and neural regeneration. With the synergy of neprilysin (NEP) gene&#8208;based beta&#8208;amyloid degradation, nanoformulation&#8208;based neuronal differentiation promotion, and neural stem cells, a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia that is currently incurable. The existing treatments can only moderately relieve the symptoms of AD&#160;to slow down its progress. How to achieve effective neural regeneration to ameliorate cognitive impairments is a major challenge for current AD&#160;treatment. Here, the therapeutic potential of a nanoformulation&#8208;mediated neural stem cell (NSC) therapy capable of simultaneous A&#946; clearance and neural regeneration is investigated in a murine model. Genetically engineered NSCs capable of stably and continuously expressing neprilysin (NEP) are developed to enhance A&#946;&#160;degradation and NSC survival in the brain. A PBAE&#8208;PLGA&#8208;Ag2S&#8208;RA&#8208;siSOX9 (PPAR&#8208;siSOX9) nanoformulation with high gene/drug deliverability is synthesized to overcome AD microenvironment&#8208;associated adverse effects and to promote neuronal differentiation of the NEP&#8208;expressing NSCs. For achieving accurate stereotactic transplantation, Ag2S quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based fluorescence imaging is used to guide NSC transplantation in real time. This strategy shows numerous benefits, including efficient and long&#8208;lasting A&#946; degradation, improved neural regeneration, and accurate cell transplantation. It is shown that a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder of Hole Transport Layer by Charge Transfer Complex for High Performance p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;transfer complex strategy to reduce the energy disorder of organic semiconductor (OS) charge transport layers (CTLs) by doping a well&#8208;designed OS (BDT&#8208;Si) with electron&#8208;acceptor features in a commercial hole&#8208;transport material (PTAA) is proposed. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells with the optimized hole&#8208;transport layer exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87%, and good operating stability at maximum power point under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor charge&#8208;transport layers (OS&#8208;CTLs) with high mobility, low trap density, and energy level alignment have dominated the important progress in p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). Unfortunately, their inevitable long chains result in weak molecular stacking, which is likely to generate high energy disorder and deteriorate the charge&#8208;transport ability of OS&#8208;CTLs. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) strategy to reduce the energy disorder in the OS&#8208;CTLs by doping an organic semiconductor, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline) (BDT&#8208;Si), in a commercial hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL), poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), is proposed. The formation of the CTC makes the PTAA conjugated backbone electron&#8208;deficient, resulting in a quinoidal and stiffer character, which is likely to planarize the PTAA backbone and enhance the ordering of the film in nanoscale. The resultant HTL exhibits a reduced energy disorder, which simultaneously promotes hole transport in the HTL, hole extraction at the interface, energy level alignment, and quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting in the device. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar pero&#8208;SCs with optimized HTL exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87% with good operating stability. This finding demonstrates that the CTC strategy is an effective way to reduce the energy disorder in HTLs and to improve the performance of planar pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconducting MOF Films on Dielectric Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method is developed to grow high&#8208;quality wafer&#8208;sacle Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film on dielectric substrates. The film exhibits p&#8208;type semiconducting property and excellent photoelectric response. Meanwhile, this growth strategy can also be used to prepare other wafer&#8208;sacle conductive MOF films.








Abstract
The preparation of large&#8208;area 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films remains highly desirable but challenging. Here, inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method to grow conductive 2D Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) MOF films on dielectric substrates is developed. Trace amounts of solutions containing low&#8208;concentration Cu2+ and TCPP are pumped cyclically into a micropore interface to produce this growth. The crystal structures are confirmed with various characterization techniques, which include high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;TEM). The Cu2(TCPP) MOF film exhibit an electrical conductivity of &#8776;0.007 S cm&#8722;1, which is approximately four orders of magnitude higher than other carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based MOF materials (10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Other wafer&#8208;scale conductive MOF films such as M3(HHTP)2 (M = Cu, Co, and Ni; HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;triphenylenehexol) can be produced utilizing this strategy and suggests this method has widescale applicability potential.

The Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(TCPP) MOF film exhibit an electrical conductivity of &#8776;0.007 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is approximately four orders of magnitude higher than other carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based MOF materials (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Other wafer&#8208;scale conductive MOF films such as M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Cu, Co, and Ni; HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;triphenylenehexol) can be produced utilizing this strategy and suggests this method has widescale applicability potential.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Texture Formation in Polycrystalline Thin Films of All&#8208;Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite exhibits pervasive texture expressions when solution processed into thin&#8208;film optical devices. Synchrotron&#8208;based large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray scattering techniques provide insights, which connect the final texture formation to the crystal symmetry of the halide perovskite, which can be tuned via halide mixing. Both I&#8208;rich and Br&#8208;rich materials each exhibit two different, energetically favored texture directions.








Abstract
Controlling grain orientations within polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells can help increase conversion efficiencies toward their thermodynamic limits; however, the forces governing texture formation are ambiguous. Using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, mesostructure formation within polycrystalline CsPbI2.85Br0.15 powders as they cool from a high&#8208;temperature cubic perovskite (&#945;&#8208;phase) is reported. Tetragonal distortions (&#946;&#8208;phase) trigger preferential crystallographic alignment within polycrystalline ensembles, a feature that is suggested here to be coordinated across multiple neighboring grains via interfacial forces that select for certain lattice distortions over others. External anisotropy is then imposed on polycrystalline thin films of orthorhombic (&#947;&#8208;phase) CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite via substrate clamping, revealing two fundamental uniaxial texture formations; i)&#160;I&#8208;rich films possess orthorhombic&#8208;like texture (&lt;100&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;010&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane), while ii) Br&#8208;rich films form tetragonal&#8208;like texture (&lt;110&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;110&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane). In contrast to relatively uninfluential factors like the choice of substrate, film thickness, and annealing temperature, Br incorporation modifies the &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx crystal structure by reducing the orthorhombic lattice distortion (making it more tetragonal&#8208;like) and governs the formation of the different, energetically favored textures within polycrystalline thin films.

         <title>Designing Adaptive Binders for Microenvironment Settings of Silicon Anode Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving high capacity in the silicon anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; is reported. The polymeric binder containing plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moieties&#8212;gallols&#8212;shows initial adaptive properties via reversible hydrogen bonds for setting of silicon microenvironments and further stabilization of SEI layers through irreversible covalent crosslinking of gallols, implementing great electrochemical performance at a rapid charge/discharge rate.








Abstract
This study reports the concept of an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; to address the silicon anode challenge in Li&#8208;ion batteries. Binders exhibit adaptable capabilities upon gradual changes in the microenvironments surrounding silicon particles during anodic expansion&#8211;shrinkage cycles. Long, flexible binder chains are repositioned and reoriented upon the gradual formation of Si&#8208;micro&#8208;environments (Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env) during the early battery cycles. At this stage, the chemical interactions between the polymeric binders are reversible hydrogen bonds. As the Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env become stably set by repeated battery cycles, the chemical interactions exhibit reversible&#8208;to&#8208;irreversible transitions by the formation of covalent linkages between the binder polymers at the later stage of cycles. The binder polymer showing the aforementioned adaptive properties is hyaluronic acid, which has never been explored as a silicon&#8208;anode binder material, onto which the plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moiety, gallol (1,2,3&#8208;trihydroxybenzene), is conjugated (HA&#8211;GA) for stable adhesion to the surfaces of silicon particles. It is confirmed that the HA&#8211;GA binder can maintain a charge capacity that is approximately 3.3 times higher (1153 mAh g&#8722;1) than that of the nonconjugated HA binder (347 mAh g&#8722;1) after 600 cycles even at a rapid charge/discharge rate of 1 C (3500&#160;mA g&#8722;1), indicating that adaptive properties are an important factor to consider in designing silicon&#8208;anode binders.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Range Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>

Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 with native transitional metal (TM) vacancies is designed as a novel cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The TM vacancies lead to nonbonding O 2p orbitals in this material, pointing toward these vacancies triggering reversible whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;range oxygen redox during charge and discharge processes. This work provides new ideals for design of cathode materials in anionic redox chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;redox of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen&#8208;redox can only be obtained in the high&#8208;voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal&#8208;oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen&#8208;redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V in a P2&#8208;layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition&#8208;metal (TM) sites and Mg&#8208;ions are located in Na sites. Mg&#8208;ions in the Na layer serve as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high&#8208;voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; and &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; to trigger oxygen&#8208;redox in the whole voltage range of charge&#8211;discharge. Time&#8208;resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V, while the redox of Fe&#8208;ions only contributes to the high&#8208;voltage region of 3.0&#8211;4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM&#8208;vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen&#8208;redox, and Mg&#8208;ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.

         <title>Programmable Phototaxis of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Particle Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic microswimmers with precise light&#8208;driven velocities are engineered with promise for robotics, drug delivery, and environmental applications. Various cargos with distinct spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the microswimmers to tune the specific wavelengths of light that lead to motion under ultraviolet, blue, green, and orange light.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven directional motion is common in nature but remains a challenge for synthetic microparticles, particularly regarding collective motion on a macroscopic scale. Successfully engineering microparticles with light&#8208;driven collective motion could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery, contaminant sensing, environmental remediation, and artificial life. Herein, metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers capable of autonomously sensing and swimming toward an external light source are reported, with the speed regulated by the wavelength and intensity of illumination. These microswimmers can travel macroscopic distances (centimeters) and can remain illuminated for hours without degradation of motility. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that motion is generated through chemical transformations of the organic component of the metal&#8211;phenolic complex. Furthermore, cargos with specific spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the particles and endow the particle microswimmers with activated motion corresponding to these spectral characteristics. The programmable nature of the light navigation, tunable size of the particles, and versatility of cargo loading demonstrate the versatility of these metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers.

         <title>A Flash&#8208;Induced Robust Cu Electrode on Glass Substrates and Its Application for Thin&#8208;Film &#956;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;induced robust Cu on a glass substrate for inorganic&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;LEDs) is developed by chemical/physical interlocking. The Cu2O layer at Cu/glass interface and Cu nano&#8208;interlocking resolve the inherent lattice mismatch for strong electrode adhesion, resulting in high optical power (41&#160;mW mm&#8211;2) of an AlGaInP vertical thin&#8208;film &#956;LED and robust &#956;LED operation under severe environmental stresses.








Abstract
A robust Cu conductor on a glass substrate for thin&#8208;film &#956;LEDs using the flash&#8208;induced chemical/physical interlocking between Cu and glass is reported. During millisecond light irradiation, CuO nanoparticles (NPs) on the display substrate are transformed into a conductive Cu film by reduction and sintering. At the same time, intensive heating at the boundary of CuO NPs and glass chemically induces the formation of an ultrathin Cu2O interlayer within the Cu/glass interface for strong adhesion. Cu nanointerlocking occurs by transient glass softening and interface fluctuation to increase the contact area. Owing to these flash&#8208;induced interfacial interactions, the flash&#8208;activated Cu electrode exhibits an adhesion energy of 10&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, which is five times higher than that of vacuum&#8208;deposited Cu. An AlGaInP thin&#8208;film vertical &#956;LED (VLED) forms an electrical interconnection with the flash&#8208;induced Cu electrode via an ACF bonding process, resulting in a high optical power density of 41&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2. The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high&#8208;temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 &#215; 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash&#8208;induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.

         <title>Growing Living Composites with Ordered Microstructures and Exceptional Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paradigm is presented to guide living bacteria to grow bionic mineralized composites. The strategy demonstrates a class of living composites with ordered microstructures and exceptional mechanical properties. This research progress highlights an exciting opportunity for future bionic composite materials by tailoring the interaction or communication between living organisms and 3D&#8208;printed synthetic materials.








Abstract
Living creatures are continuous sources of inspiration for designing synthetic materials. However, living creatures are typically different from synthetic materials because the former consist of living cells to support their growth and regeneration. Although natural systems can grow materials with sophisticated microstructures, how to harness living cells to grow materials with predesigned microstructures in engineering systems remains largely elusive. Here, an attempt to exploit living bacteria and 3D&#8208;printed materials to grow bionic mineralized composites with ordered microstructures is reported. The bionic composites exhibit outstanding specific strength and fracture toughness, which are comparable to natural composites, and exceptional energy absorption capability superior to both natural and artificial counterparts. This report opens the door for 3D&#8208;architectured hybrid synthetic&#8211;living materials with living ordered microstructures and exceptional properties.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Layered Heterostructure Ionogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries (Adv. Mater. 13/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed by Mark C. Hersam and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007864, using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared with ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Compared with ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Redox co&#8208;mediation provides an effective approach to promote the reaction kinetics of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. In article number 2007298, Jia&#8208;Qi Huang and co&#8208;workers propose an organodiselenide as a redox co&#8208;mediator to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics. The organodiselenide co&#8208;mediator endows lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with superb electrochemical performance with high actual energy density of 301 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work inspires further exploration in mediating Li&#8211;S kinetics for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <dc:description>
2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films are recognized as a promising candidate for applications in electronics. In article number 2007741, Jianyi Chen, Yunqi Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method to obtain high&#8208;quality, conductive Cu2(TCPP) MOF films directly on various dielectric substrates. The strategy is achieved by pumping Cu2+ and TCPP cyclically into a micropore interface to produce this growth.

         <title>Review on Recent Developments in 2D Ferroelectrics: Theories and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. Relevant theories, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic 2D ferroelectrics, are outlined. Further, the existing challenges and prospects of the exploration in 2D ferroelectrics are also discussed, which should provide unprecedented opportunities in the fields of electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, and valleytronics.








Abstract
Although only a few 2D materials have been predicted to possess ferroelectricity, 2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. The ferroelectric properties of 2D ferroelectrics are significantly different than those of traditional bulk ferroelectrics owing to their intrinsic size and surface effects. To date, 2D&#160;ferroelectrics have been reported to exhibit diverse properties ranging from bulk photovoltaic and piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects to the spontaneous valley and spin polarization. These properties are either dependent on ferroelectric polarization or coupled with it for easy electric control, thus making 2D ferroelectrics applicable to multifunctional nanodevices. At present, cumulative efforts are being made to explore 2D ferroelectrics in theories, experiments, and applications. Herein, such theories and methods are briefly introduced. Subsequently, intrinsic and extrinsic origins of 2D&#160;ferroelectricity are separately summarized. In addition, invented or laboratory&#8208;validated 2D ferroelectric&#8208;based applications are listed. Finally, the existing challenges and prospects of 2D ferroelectrics are discussed.

         <title>Surface and Interface Engineering of Nanoarrays toward Advanced Electrodes and Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview of surface and interface engineering of 3D nanoarray (3D&#8208;NA) electrodes is provided. The concepts and principles for utilizing 3D&#8208;NAs in purposely designed electrode architectures, charge storage mechanism analysis, and integrated device architecture design are outlined. Future perspectives and solutions to achieve electrode charge balance, multiphase solid&#8208;state interface optimization, and 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are also presented.








Abstract
The overall performance of electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) is intrinsically correlated with surfaces and interfaces. As a promising electrode architecture, 3D nanoarrays (3D&#8208;NAs) possess relatively ordered, continuous, and fully exposed active surfaces of individual nanostructures, facilitating mass and electron transport within the electrode and charge transfer across interfaces and providing an ideal platform for engineering. Herein, a critical overview of the surface and interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs, from electrode and interface designs to device integration, is presented. The general merits of 3D&#8208;NAs and surface/interface engineering principles of 3D&#8208;NA hybrid electrodes are highlighted. The focus is on the use of 3D&#8208;NAs as a superior platform to regulate the interface nature and unveiling new mechanism/materials without the interference of binders. The engineering and utilization of the surface of 3D&#8208;NAs to develop flexible/solid&#8208;state EESDs with 3D integrated electrode/electrolyte interfaces, or 3D triphase interfaces involving other active species, which are characteristic of (quasi&#8208;)solid&#8208;state electrolyte infiltration into the entire device, are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions of surface/interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs are outlined. In particular, potential strategies to obtain electrode charge balance, optimize the multiphase solid&#8208;state interface, and attain 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are proposed.

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Twisted Bilayer Graphenes and Their Unique Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in fabrication of twisted bilayer graphene by the mainstream methods and the topological physical properties applied in different applications is comprehensively presented. The discovery of killer applications with suitable preparation method for twisted bilayer graphene is systematically discussed by listing the advantages and disadvantages of preparation methods and various applications.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) exhibits a host of innovative physical phenomena owing to the formation of moir&#233; superlattice. Especially, the discovery of superconducting behavior has generated new interest in graphene. The growing studies of tBLG mainly focus on its physical properties, while the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tBLG is a prerequisite for achieving the desired properties due to the great dependence on the twist angle and the interfacial contact. Here, the cutting&#8208;edge preparation strategies and challenges of tBLG fabrication are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of chemical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth on silicon carbide, stacking monolayer graphene, and folding monolayer graphene methods for the fabrication of tBLG are analyzed in detail, providing a reference for further development of preparation methods. Moreover, the characterization methods of twist angle for the tBLG are presented. Then, the unique physicochemical properties and corresponding applications of tBLG, containing correlated insulating and superconducting states, ferromagnetic state, soliton, enhanced optical absorption, tunable bandgap, and lithium intercalation and diffusion, are described. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for fabricating high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;area tBLG are discussed, unique physical properties are displayed, and new applications inferred from its angle&#8208;dependent features are explored, thereby impelling the commercialization of tBLG from laboratory to market.

         <title>In Search of Excellence: Convex versus Concave Noble Metal Nanostructures for Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave noble metal nanocrystals represent the new class of electrocatalyst materials. In recent decades, extensive works have been employed in the search for excellent catalyst materials for electrocatalysis applications. The surface defects and structural stability are considered responsible for the superiority of concave noble metals compared to their conventional convex counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the shape of noble metal nanoparticles is a challenging but important task in electrocatalysis. Apart from hollow and nanocage structures, concave noble metal nanoparticles are considered a new class of unconventional electrocatalysts that exhibit superior electrocatalytic properties as compared with those of conventional nanoparticles (including convex and flat ones). Herein, several facile and highly reproducible routes for synthesizing nanostructured concave noble metal materials reported in the literature are discussed, together with their advantages over noble metal nanoparticles with convex shapes. In addition, possible ways of optimizing the synthesis procedure and enhancing the electrocatalytic characteristics of concave metal nanoparticles are suggested. Nanostructured noble metals with concave features are found to show better catalytic activity and stability hence improve their practical applicability in electrocatalysis.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing intracellular delivery approaches are differentiated by their impact resolution to macro&#8208; and micro/nanoengineering strategies. Each method is characterized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargo inside the cell of interest. The applications and future perspectives of micro/nanoscale delivery strategies are discussed.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery is considered an indispensable process for various studies, ranging from medical applications (cell&#8208;based therapy) to fundamental (genome&#8208;editing) and industrial (biomanufacture) approaches. Conventional macroscale delivery systems critically suffer from such issues as low cell viability, cytotoxicity, and inconsistent material delivery, which have opened up an interest in the development of more efficient intracellular delivery systems. In line with the advances in microfluidics and nanotechnology, intracellular delivery based on micro&#8208; and nanoengineered platforms has progressed rapidly and held great promises owing to their unique features. These approaches have been advanced to introduce a smorgasbord of diverse cargoes into various cell types with the maximum efficiency and the highest precision. This review differentiates macro&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and nanoengineered approaches for intracellular delivery. The macroengineered delivery platforms are first summarized and then each method is categorized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargoes inside the cells. Second, particular emphasis is placed on the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered advances in the delivery of biomolecules inside the cells. Furthermore, the applications and challenges of the established and emerging delivery approaches are summarized. The topic is concluded by evaluating the future perspective of intracellular delivery toward the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered approaches.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms Supported on N&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Hollow Carbon Spheres with Enhanced Electrocatalytic H2&#8208;Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon sphere supported Pt single atom (Pt1/NMHCS) composite for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is fabricated by a novel strategy. Owing to the strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction in the unique N1&#8722;Pt&#8722;C2 coordination structure that significantly alters the electronic structure of the Pt 5d states, both the reduction of adsorbed H+ and the generation of H2 are promoted, thus leading to bare&#8208;Pt&#8208;like activity and extraordinary durability for HER.








Abstract
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis as it can induce electron transfer between metal and support, modulate the electronic state of the supported metal, and optimize the reduction of intermediate species. In this work, the tailoring of electronic structure of Pt single atoms supported on N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (Pt1/NMHCS) via strong EMSI engineering is reported. The Pt1/NMHCS composite is much more active and stable than the nanoparticle (PtNP) counterpart and commercial 20&#160;wt% Pt/C for catalyzing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), exhibiting a low overpotential of 40&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 2.07 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 50&#160;mV overpotential, a large turnover frequency of 20.18 s&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, and outstanding durability in acidic electrolyte. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the strong EMSI effect in a unique N1&#8722;Pt1&#8722;C2 coordination structure significantly tailors the electronic structure of Pt 5d states, resulting in promoted reduction of adsorbed proton, facilitated H&#8722;H coupling, and thus Pt&#8208;like HER activity. This work provides a constructive route for precisely designing single&#8208;Pt&#8208;atom&#8208;based robust electrocatalysts with high HER activity and durability.

         <title>Conferring Ti&#8208;Based MOFs with Defects for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) is successfully constructed by simple hydrogenation and serves as a new generation of robust sonosensitizer for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. Moreover, it also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to amplify reactive oxygen species production under ultrasound irradiation. Besides, the degradability of D&#8208;MOF(Ti) is a bright spot for promoting its clinical transformation.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient, multifunctional, and biocompatible sonosensitizer is still a priority for current sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, a defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) with greatly improved sonosensitizing effect is simply constructed and used for enhanced SDT. Compared with the commonly used sonosensitizer TiO2, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) results in a superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) yield under ultrasound (US) irradiation due to its narrow bandgap, which principally improves the US&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole separation. Meanwhile, due to the existence of Ti3+ ions, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to enable chemodynamic therapy. Particularly, US as the excitation source of SDT can simultaneously enhance the Fenton&#8208;like reaction to achieve remarkably synergistic outcomes for oncotherapy. More importantly, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) can be degraded and metabolized out of the body after completion of its therapeutic functions without off&#8208;target toxicity. Overall, this work identifies a novel Ti&#8208;familial sonosensitizer harboring great potential for synergistic sonodynamic and chemodynamic cancer therapy.

         <title>Epigenetic Remodeling Hydrogel Patches for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epi&#8208;gel provides chemosensitivity recovery and immune activation via simultaneous remodeling of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;IC) stemness and innate immune response. A single dose of epi&#8208;gel pools the advantages of epigenetic therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in the treatment of multidrug&#8208;resistant triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), achieving superior therapeutic outcomes compared to conventional drug delivery.








Abstract
The induced expansion of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;ICs) upon repeated exposure of tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs forms a major cause for chemoresistance and cancer metastasis. Here, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive hydrogel patch is designed to modulate the plasticity of T&#8208;ICs in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is insensitive to hormone&#8208; and HER2&#8208;targeting. The on&#8208;site formation of the hydrogel network patches tumors in a chemoresistant TNBC murine model and senses intratumoral reactive oxygen species for linker cleavage and payload release. Patch&#8208;mediated inhibition of the histone demethylase lysine&#8208;specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) epigenetically regulates the switch of T&#8208;ICs from self&#8208;renewal to differentiation, rehabilitating their chemosensitivity. Moreover, the hydrogel patch enhances tumor immunogenicity and increases T&#8208;cell infiltration via epigenetic activation of innate immunity. A single&#8208;dose of the hydrogel patch harboring LSD1 inhibitor and chemotherapy agent efficiently suppresses tumor growth, postsurgical relapse, and metastasis. The superior efficacy against multidrug resistance further reveals the broad applicability of epigenetic remodeling hydrogel patches.

         <dc:description>
Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are developed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor configuration. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off is due to the high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and short delayed exciton lifetime.








Abstract
Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are reported. These materials are designed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A) configuration, containing rigid boron acceptors and dihydrophenazine donor moieties. These materials exhibit a small &#916;EST of 0.05&#8211;0.06&#160;eV, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as near unity, and short delayed exciton lifetime (&#964;d) of less than 2.63 &#181;s in 5 wt% doped film. Further, these materials show a high reverse intersystem crossing rate (krisc) on the order of 106 s&#8722;1. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum EQE of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and electroluminescence (EL) maxima at 576 nm and 595&#160;nm, respectively. The low roll&#8208;off character of these materials is analyzed by using a roll&#8208;off model and the exciton annihilation quenching rates are found to be suppressed by the fast krisc and short delayed exciton lifetime. These devices show operating device lifetimes (LT50) of 159 and 193 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 for PzTDBA and PzDBA, respectively. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off of these materials are attributed to the good electronic properties originatng from the A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecular configuration.

         <title>Nanoporous Intermetallic Pd3Bi for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi is prepared through electrochemical etching of PdBi2, and it can achieve extraordinary catalytic performance with high selectivity and excellent stability for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient conditions. The intermetallic interaction between the Pd and neighboring Bi sites in nanoporous Pd3Bi can stabilize the transition state and lower the barrier for efficient NRR.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction at ambient temperature is a green technology for artificial nitrogen fixation but greatly challenging with low yield and poor selectivity. Here, a nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi prepared by converting chemically etched nanoporous PdBi2 exhibits efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction under ambient conditions. The resulting nanoporous intermetallic Pd3Bi can achieve high activity and selectivity with an NH3 yield rate of 59.05&#160;&#177; 2.27&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 21.52&#160;&#177; 0.71% at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.05 m H2SO4 electrolyte, outperforming most of the reported catalysts in electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy studies combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that strong coupling between the Pd&#8211;Bi sites bridges the electron&#8208;transfer channel of intermetallic Pd3Bi, in which the Bi sites can absorb N2 molecules and lower the energy barrier of *N2 for N2 adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, the intermetallic Pd3Bi with bicontinuous nanoporous structure can accelerate the electron transport during the NRR process, thus improving the NRR performance.

         <title>Exploiting Mechanical Instabilities in Soft Robotics: Control, Sensing, and Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical instabilities provide a novel route to achieve power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. An overview of the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. These strategies have the potential to address the current challenges in the areas of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation.








Abstract
The rapidly expanding field of soft robotics has provided multiple examples of how entirely soft machines and actuators can outperform conventional rigid robots in terms of adaptability, maneuverability, and safety. Unfortunately, the soft and flexible materials used in their construction impose intrinsic limitations on soft robots, such as low actuation speeds and low output forces. Nature offers multiple examples where highly flexible organisms exploit mechanical instabilities to store and rapidly release energy. Guided by these examples, researchers have recently developed a variety of strategies to overcome speed and power limitations in soft robotics using mechanical instabilities. These mechanical instabilities provide, through rapid transitions from structurally stable states, a new route to achieve high output power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. Here, an overview of the literature related to the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. Additionally, strategies using structural phase transitions to address current challenges in the area of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation are discussed. Approaches using instabilities to create entirely soft logic modules to imbue soft robots with material intelligence and distributed computational capabilities are also reviewed.

         <title>Development of a Cancer Vaccine Using In Vivo Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Mediated Active Lymph Node Accumulation for Improved Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based active lymph node (LN) accumulation system is developed by surface modification of lymphatic endothelial cells with azide groups, which provide targets for dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified liposomes, to improve the delivery of encapsulated cargoes to LNs. When loading with antigens and adjuvants, the formulation elicits an enhanced immune response, resulting in a much more efficient therapeutic effect and prolonged survival of mice.








Abstract
Due to their ability to elicit a potent immune reaction with low systemic toxicity, cancer vaccines represent a promising strategy for treating tumors. Considerable effort has been directed toward improving the in vivo efficacy of cancer vaccines, with direct lymph node (LN) targeting being the most promising approach. Here, a click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based active LN accumulation system (ALAS) is developed by surface modification of lymphatic endothelial cells with an azide group, which provide targets for dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified liposomes, to improve the delivery of encapsulated antigen and adjuvant to LNs. When loading with OVA257&#8211;264 peptide and poly(I:C), the formulation elicits an enhanced CD8+ T cell response in vivo, resulting in a much more efficient therapeutic effect and prolonged median survival of mice. Compared to treatment with DBCO&#8208;conjugated liposomes (DL)&#8208;Ag/Ad without the azide targeting, the percent survival of ALAS&#8208;vaccine&#8208;treated mice improves by 100% over 60 days. Altogether, the findings indicate that the novel ALAS approach is a powerful strategy to deliver vaccine components to LNs for enhanced antitumor immunity.

         <title>Optically and Electrocatalytically Decoupled Si Photocathodes with a Porous Carbon Nitride Catalyst for Nitrogen Reduction with Over 61.8% Faradaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si photocathode with a unique design, in which the light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis components in the monolithic device are spatially decoupled, exhibits outstanding photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction activity with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 61.8% and NH3 yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.








Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach is attractive as a promising route for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) toward ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the challenges in synergistic management of optical, electrical, and catalytic properties have limited the efficiency of PEC NRR devices. Herein, to enhance light&#8208;harvesting, carrier separation/transport, and the catalytic reactions, a concept of decoupling light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis by employing a cascade n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode is implemented. Such a decoupling design not only abolishes the parasitic light blocking but also concurrently improves the optical and electrical properties of the n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode without compromising the efficiency. Experimental and density functional theory studies reveal that the porous architecture and N&#8208;vacancies promote N2 adsorption of the Au/porous carbon nitride (PCN) catalyst. Impressively, an n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode integrating the Au/PCN catalyst exhibits an outstanding PEC NRR performance with maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 61.8% and NH3 production yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is the highest FE at low applied potential ever reported for the PEC NRR.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex and coupled (electro)chemical processes complicate the investigation of the working and decay mechanisms of batteries. ssNMR and MRI techniques exhibit unique capability in studying both the local environment and ionic dynamic issues in electrochemical energy materials and devices, including three key aspects, that are, electrode/electrolyte materials, electrode/electrolyte interfaces and in situ ssNMR.








Abstract
Enhancing the electrochemical performance of batteries, including the lifespan, energy, and power densities, is an everlasting quest for the rechargeable battery community. However, the dynamic and coupled (electro)chemical processes that occur in the electrode materials as well as at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces complicate the investigation of their working and decay mechanisms. Herein, the recent developments and applications of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in Li/Na batteries are reviewed. Several typical cases including the applications of NMR spectroscopy for the investigation of the pristine structure and the dynamic structural evolution of materials are first emphasized. The NMR applications in analyzing the solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) on the electrode are further concluded, involving the identification of SEI components and investigation of ionic motion through the interfaces. Beyond, the new development of in situ NMR and MRI techniques are highlighted, including their advantages, challenges, applications and the design principle of in situ cell. In the end, a prospect about how to use ssNMR in battery research from the perspectives of materials, interface, and in situ NMR, aiming at obtaining deeper insight of batteries with the assistance of ssNMR is represented.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the electrochemical performance of batteries, including the lifespan, energy, and power densities, is an everlasting quest for the rechargeable battery community. However, the dynamic and coupled (electro)chemical processes that occur in the electrode materials as well as at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces complicate the investigation of their working and decay mechanisms. Herein, the recent developments and applications of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in Li/Na batteries are reviewed. Several typical cases including the applications of NMR spectroscopy for the investigation of the pristine structure and the dynamic structural evolution of materials are first emphasized. The NMR applications in analyzing the solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) on the electrode are further concluded, involving the identification of SEI components and investigation of ionic motion through the interfaces. Beyond, the new development of in situ NMR and MRI techniques are highlighted, including their advantages, challenges, applications and the design principle of in situ cell. In the end, a prospect about how to use ssNMR in battery research from the perspectives of materials, interface, and in situ NMR, aiming at obtaining deeper insight of batteries with the assistance of ssNMR is represented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Smart Hydrogel Releasing Immune Adjuvant Synchronized with Repeated Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alginate is conjugated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based smart hydrogel is formed in situ. Low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, can trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with an ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release to boost antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Certain chemotherapeutics and forms of ionizing radiation can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). If there simultaneously exist immune adjuvants within the tumor, such antitumor immunity would be further amplified. However, as clinical chemo/radiotherapies are usually repeatedly given at low individual doses, it would be impractical to administrate immune adjuvants into tumors at each dose of chemo/radiotherapies. Thus, a smart hydrogel is developed that releases immune adjuvants in response to repeatedly applied chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies. Herein, alginate is conjugated with an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;specific aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based hydrogel is formed in situ. Interestingly, low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing ICD of tumor cells, could trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release. Therefore, the smart hydrogel could release the immune adjuvant synchronized with low&#8208;dose repeated chemo/radiotherapies, achieving remarkable synergistic responses in eliminating established tumors, as well as immune memory to reject re&#8208;challenged tumors. Moreover, repeated radiotherapies assisted by the smart hydrogel could inhibit distant tumor metastases, especially in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. The study presents a conceptually new strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy coherent with repeated low&#8208;dose chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies following a clinically relevant manner.

         <title>Self&#8208;Structural Healing of Encapsulated Perovskite Microcrystals for Improved Optical and Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;sufficient micron&#8208;level vacuum growth chamber is proposed for MAPbBr3 microcrystals to effectively prevent water and oxygen, and to greatly improve the thermal and optical stability by the reduction of deep level trap states.








Abstract
Perovskite materials and their optoelectronic devices have attracted intensive attentions in recent years. However, it is difficult to further improve the performance of perovskite devices due to the poor stability and the intrinsic deep level trap states (DLTS), which are caused by surface dangling bonds and grain boundaries. Herein, the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite microcrystal is encapsulated by a dense Al2O3 layer to form a microenvironment. Through optical measurement, it is found that the structure of perovskite can be healed by itself even under high temperature and long&#8208;time laser illumination. The DLTS density decreases nearly an order of magnitude, which results in 4&#8211;14 times enhancement of light emission. The observation is ascribed to the micron&#8208;level environment, which serves as a self&#8208;sufficient high&#8208;vacuum growth chamber, where the components of the perovskite are completely retained when sublimated and the decomposed atoms can re&#8208;arrange after thermal treatment. The modified structure showing high thermal stability is able to maintain excellent optical and lasing stability up to 2 years. This discovery provides a new idea and perspective for improving the stability of perovskite and can be of practical interest for perovskite device application.

         <title>Excited State Energy Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited state energy transfer in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) plays important role in using these materials for photocatalysis, fluorescence sensing, and emitting. Study of energy transfer mechanism helps to design efficient and directional energy transfer paths in MOFs to meet the needs of artificial photosynthesis, high&#8208;performance chemical sensors, and novel exciton&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Excited state energy transfer in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great interest due to potential application of these materials in photocatalysis and fluorescence sensing. In photocatalysis, a light&#8208;harvesting antenna of MOFs can collect energy from a much larger area than a single reaction center and efficiently transport the energy to the active site to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, mimicking nature photosynthesis. In fluorescence sensing, excited state traveling on the framework can search for analyte quencher molecules to give amplified fluorescence quenching, so that one quencher turns off multiple excited states to enhance signal. Key to these designer performances is highly efficient energy transfer on these framework materials that are determined by types of excited states, dimension of the materials, and structure of the frameworks. Advancement of MOF synthetic chemistry provides new tools to control the rate and directionality of energy transfer in these materials, opening opportunities in manipulating excited states at an unprecedented level.

         <title>Reconstructable Gradient Structures and Reprogrammable 3D Deformations of Hydrogels with Coumarin Units as the Photolabile Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable shape&#8208;morphing of hydrogels is realized on the basis of reconstructable gradient networks containing coumarin units as photolabile crosslinks. Reversible photodimerization and photocleavage of coumarins at specific regions of one hydrogel are directed by photolithography. The reprogrammed structural gradients result in distinct internal stresses and 3D deformations of the hydrogel into different configurations.








Abstract
Morphing hydrogels have versatile applications in soft robotics, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices. Controlling component distribution and internal stress within a hydrogel is crucial for shape&#8208;changing. However, existing gradient structures of hydrogels are usually non&#8208;reconstructable, once encoded by chemical reactions and covalent bonds. Fabricating hydrogels with distinct gradient structures is inevitable for every new configuration, resulting in poor reusability, adaptability, and sustainability that are disadvantageous for diverse applications. Herein, a hydrogel containing reversible photo&#8208;crosslinks that enable reprogramming of the gradient structures and 3D deformations into various configurations is reported. The hydrogel is prepared by micellar polymerization of hydrophobic coumarin monomer and hydrophilic acrylic acid. The presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride micelles increases the local concentration of coumarin units and also improves the mechanical properties of the hydrogel by forming robust polyelectrolyte/surfactant complexes that serve as the physical crosslinks. High&#8208;efficiency photodimerization and photocleavage reactions of coumarins are realized under 365 and 254 nm light irradiation, respectively, affording reversible tuning of the network structure of the hydrogel. Through photolithography, different gradient structures are sequentially patterned in one hydrogel that direct the deformations into distinct configurations. Such a strategy should be applicable for other photolabile hydrogels toward reprogrammable control of network structures and versatile functions.

         <title>Interactive Materials for Bidirectional Redox&#8208;Based Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active catechol&#8208;based film can autonomously synthesize diffusible H2O2 signals that enable interactive communication with biology. The reducing redox activities of a bacterial culture provide the electrons that poise this film for subsequent electron&#8208;donation to O2 to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that induces redox&#8208;responsive gene expression.








Abstract
Emerging research indicates that biology routinely uses diffusible redox&#8208;active molecules to mediate communication that can span biological systems (e.g., nervous and immune) and even kingdoms (e.g., a microbiome and its plant/animal host). This redox modality also provides new opportunities to create interactive materials that can communicate with living systems. Here, it is reported that the fabrication of a redox&#8208;active hydrogel film can autonomously synthesize a H2O2 signaling molecule for communication with a bacterial population. Specifically, a catechol&#8208;conjugated/crosslinked 4&#8208;armed thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel film is electrochemically fabricated in which the added catechol moieties confer redox activity: the film can accept electrons from biological reductants (e.g., ascorbate) and donate electrons to O2 to generate H2O2. Electron&#8208;transfer from an Escherichia coli culture poises this film to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that can induce bacterial gene expression from a redox&#8208;responsive operon. Overall, this work demonstrates that catecholic materials can participate in redox&#8208;based interactions that elicit specific biological responses, and also suggests the possibility that natural phenolics may be a ubiquitous biological example of interactive materials.

Here, it is reported that the fabrication of a redox&#8208;active hydrogel film can autonomously synthesize a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling molecule for communication with a bacterial population. Specifically, a catechol&#8208;conjugated/crosslinked 4&#8208;armed thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel film is electrochemically fabricated in which the added catechol moieties confer redox activity: the film can accept electrons from biological reductants (e.g., ascorbate) and donate electrons to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Electron&#8208;transfer from an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; culture poises this film to generate the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling molecule that can induce bacterial gene expression from a redox&#8208;responsive operon. Overall, this work demonstrates that catecholic materials can participate in redox&#8208;based interactions that elicit specific biological responses, and also suggests the possibility that natural phenolics may be a ubiquitous biological example of interactive materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Bioinspired Elastic Hydrogel for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from various contaminated sources containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only natural sunlight. Since the purification mechanism relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation and does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported.








Abstract
The global demand for clean and safe water will continue to grow well into the 21st century. Moving forward, the lack of access to clean water, which threatens human health and strains precious energy resources, will worsen as the climate changes. Therefore, future innovations that produce potable water from contaminated sources must be sustainable. Inspired by nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from contaminated sources using only natural sunlight. The SAG is composed of an elastic thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel, a photothermal polydopamine (PDA) layer, and a sodium alginate (SA) network. Production of the SAG is facile; all processing is aqueous&#8208;based and occurs at room temperature. Remarkably, the SAG can purify water from various harmful reservoirs containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only sunlight. The SAG relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation at the lower critical solution temperature. Since the purification mechanism does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the passive solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported. This discovery can be transformative in the sustainable production of clean water to improve the quality of human life.

         <title>Touch&#8208;Based Stressless Cortisol Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stress&#8208;free detection of cortisol using natural figure sweat is reported. Using an electrodeposited molecularly imprinted polymer with an embedded Prussian blue probe for label&#8208;free sensing and a highly permeable hydrogel for rapid natural sweat extraction from the fingertip, the sensor, in both strip and stretchable patch form factors, can detect the cortisol level in 3.5&#160;min with a simple touch.








Abstract
Tracking fluctuations of the cortisol level is important in understanding the body's endocrine response to stress stimuli. Traditional cortisol sensing relies on centralized laboratory settings, while wearable cortisol sensors are limited to slow and complex assays. Here, a touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor for rapid, simple, and reliable stress&#8208;free detection of sweat cortisol is described. The sensor readily measures fingertip sweat cortisol via highly selective binding to the cortisol&#8208;imprinted electropolymerized polypyrrole coating. The MIP network is embedded with Prussian blue redox probes that offer direct electrical signaling of the binding event to realize sensitive label&#8208;free amperometric detection. Using a highly permeable sweat&#8208;wicking porous hydrogel, instantaneously secreted fingertip sweat can be conveniently and rapidly collected without any assistance. By eliminating time lags, such rapid (3.5&#160;min) fingertip assay enables the capture of sharp variations in cortisol levels, compared to previous methods. Such advantages are demonstrated by tracking cortisol response in short cold&#8208;pressor tests and throughout day&#8208;long circadian rhythm, along with gold&#8208;standard immunoassay validation. A stretchable epidermal MIP sensor is also described for directly tracking cortisol in exercise&#8208;induced sweat. The rapid touch&#8208;based cortisol sensor offers an attractive, accessible, stressless avenue for quantitative stress management.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence Rebrightening the Prospects of Stress Sensing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanoluminescence&#8208;based stress sensing exhibits many advantages, including remoteness, spatial distribution, stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;powering. With great potential in wearable device, biomechanics, and engineering structure diagnosis applications, it is reasonable to believe that the mechanoluminescence&#8208;based stress sensing may rebrighten the prospects of stress sensing.








Abstract
The emergence of new applications, such as in artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and biotechnology, has driven the evolution of stress sensing technology. For these emerging applications, stretchability, remoteness, stress distribution, a multimodal nature, and biocompatibility are important performance characteristics of stress sensors. Mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based stress sensing has attracted widespread attention because of its characteristics of remoteness and having a distributed response to mechanical stimuli as well as its great potential for stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;powering. In the past few decades, great progress has been made in the discovery of ML materials, analysis of mechanisms, design of devices, and exploration of applications. One can find that with this progress, the focus of ML research has shifted from the phenomenon in the earliest stage to materials and recently toward devices. At the present stage, while showing great prospects for advanced stress sensing applications, ML&#8208;based sensing still faces major challenges in material optimization, device design, and system integration.

         <title>Leveraging on ENZ Metamaterials to Achieve 2D and 3D Hyper&#8208;Resolution in Two&#8208;Photon Direct Laser Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is enhanced to hyper&#8208;resolution by leveraging on the extraordinary laser writing collimation enabled by &#949;NZ metamaterials. The realization of ultrathin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses and a highly detailed Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221; bas&#8208;relief (500 nm full height) confirms full freedom in nanofabrication. These results show intriguing cues in trendsetting research scenarios and industry application.








Abstract
A novel technique is developed to improve the resolution of two&#8208;photon direct laser writing lithography. Thanks to the high collimation enabled by extraordinary &#949;NZ (near&#8208;zero) metamaterial features, ultrathin dielectric hyper&#8208;resolute nanostructures are within reach. With respect to the standard direct laser writing approach, a size reduction of 89% and 50%, in height and width respectively, is achieved with the height of the structures adjustable between 5 and 50&#160;nm. The retrieved 2D fabrication parameters are exploited for realizing extremely thin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses tailored through deep machine learning codes. The hyper&#8208;resolution achieved in the writing process enables the fabrication of a highly detailed dielectric 3D bas&#8208;relief (with full height of 500&#160;nm) of Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221;. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results show intriguing cues for the current and trendsetting research scenario in anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications and ultracompact photonics, paving the way for the realization of all&#8208;dielectric and apochromatic ultrathin imaging&#160;systems.

         <title>Antimony Nanopolyhedrons with Tunable Localized Surface Plasmon Resonances for Highly Effective Photoacoustic&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Synergistic Photothermal/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for preparing high&#8208;quality Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with tunable localized surface plasmon resonance is successfully developed. The PEGylated Sb NPHs show an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal stability under irradiation at 808&#160;nm. As a result, highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergic therapies based on Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are presented.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb), a typical group VA semimetal, has rarely been studied both experimentally and theoretically in plasmonic photothermal therapy, possibly due to the lack of effective morphology&#8208;controllable methods for the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb nanocrystals. In this study, an effective ligand&#8208;guided growth strategy to controllably synthesize Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE), good photothermal stability, as well as biocompatibility is presented. Furthermore, the modulation effect of different morphologies on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Sb NPHs in experimentation is successfully observed. When the resonance frequency of the Sb NPHs is matched well with the excitation wavelength (808&#160;nm), the PTCE of the Sb NPHs is as high as 62.1%, which is noticeably higher compared to most of the reported photothermal agents. The Sb NPHs also exhibit good photothermal stability. In addition, Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are further constructed via loading 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;tryptophan on PEGylated Sb NPHs for a highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photothermal/immune&#8208;therapy of tumors in vivo. This work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations of Sb NPHs and other semimetal nanomaterials regarding their LSPR properties and inspire various potential applications of semimetals in biomedicine and sensors.

&lt;p&gt;A facile strategy for preparing high&#8208;quality Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with tunable localized surface plasmon resonance is successfully developed. The PEGylated Sb NPHs show an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal stability under irradiation at 808&#160;nm. As a result, highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergic therapies based on Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are presented.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimony (Sb), a typical group VA semimetal, has rarely been studied both experimentally and theoretically in plasmonic photothermal therapy, possibly due to the lack of effective morphology&#8208;controllable methods for the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb nanocrystals. In this study, an effective ligand&#8208;guided growth strategy to controllably synthesize Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE), good photothermal stability, as well as biocompatibility is presented. Furthermore, the modulation effect of different morphologies on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Sb NPHs in experimentation is successfully observed. When the resonance frequency of the Sb NPHs is matched well with the excitation wavelength (808&#160;nm), the PTCE of the Sb NPHs is as high as 62.1%, which is noticeably higher compared to most of the reported photothermal agents. The Sb NPHs also exhibit good photothermal stability. In addition, Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are further constructed via loading 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;tryptophan on PEGylated Sb NPHs for a highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photothermal/immune&#8208;therapy of tumors in vivo. This work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations of Sb NPHs and other semimetal nanomaterials regarding their LSPR properties and inspire various potential applications of semimetals in biomedicine and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Diagnostic Polymers&#8212;Inline Detection of Thermal Degradation of Unsaturated Poly(ester imide)s</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inline sensing system for degradation of polyester resins is reported, able to detect thermal degradation within widely used poly(ester imide) (PEI) resins. Trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbenes act as sensor molecules, detecting the release of alcoholic degradation products. Solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy is able to monitor long&#8208;term degradation of the PEI resins.








Abstract
Monitoring polymer degradation is an important quest, particularly relevant for industry. Although many indirect methodologies for assessing polymer degradation exist, only few are applicable for an inline&#8208;monitoring via optic detection&#8208;systems. An inline&#8208;monitoring system is introduced for the thermal degradation of crosslinked poly(ester imide)s (PEIs) by embedding trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbene molecules, serving as chemosensors to track the release of generated alcoholic byproducts. Nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to the sensors trifluoroacetyl functionality triggers hemiacetal formation which is accompanied by significant changes in optical properties, in turn allowing monitoring of sensor activation by direct spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers an easy detection tool for the inline thermal monitoring of PEI&#8208;degradation.

         <title>Superkinetic Growth of Oval Organic Semiconductor Microcrystals for Chaotic Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superkinetic crystal growth strategy is developed to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces by breaking the crystal growth anisotropy. The oval organic semiconductor microcrystals constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators, which enable low&#8208;threshold directional lasing.








Abstract
Synthesis of novel mesoscopic semiconductor architectures continually generates new photonic knowledge and applications. However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces owing to the crystal growth anisotropy. Here, a superkinetic crystal growth method is developed to synthesize 2D oval organic semiconductor microcrystals. The solid source dispersion induces an exceptionally large molecular supersaturation for vapor deposition, which breaks the crystal growth anisotropy. The synthesized stadium&#8208;shaped organic semiconductor microcrystals naturally constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators. They support low&#8208;threshold lasing on high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor scar modes localized near the stadium boundary and directional laser emission assisted by the chaotic modes. These results will reshape the understanding of the crystal growth theory and provide valuable guidance for crystalline photonic materials design.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Cathodes with Sub&#8208;Micrometer Particles by Modifying the Excess&#8208;Li Distribution</title>

         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide (LMR) cathode for a practical Li&#8208;ion battery system through a novel structural and morphological design is reported: a relatively delocalized excess&#8208;Li system in sub&#8208;micrometer particles. The lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized LMR exhibits an outstanding energy density over other prospective cathode materials, and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention in full&#8208;cells in practical conditions.








Abstract
In recent years, Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMRs) have been vigorously explored as promising cathodes for next&#8208;generation, Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific energy. Nevertheless, their actual implementation is still far from a reality since the trade&#8208;off relationship between the particle size and chemical reversibility prevents LMRs from achieving a satisfactory, industrial energy density. To solve this material dilemma, herein, a novel morphological and structural design is introduced to Li1.11Mn0.49Ni0.29Co0.11O2, reporting a sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;level LMR with a relatively delocalized, excess&#8208;Li system. This system exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 2880&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention of 83.1% after the 100th cycle for 45 &#176;C full&#8208;cell cycling, despite its practical electrode conditions. This outstanding electrochemical performance is a result of greater lattice&#8208;oxygen stability in the delocalized excess&#8208;Li system because of the low amount of highly oxidized oxygen ions. Geometric dispersion of the labile oxygen ions effectively suppresses oxygen evolution from the lattice when delithiated, eradicating the rapid energy degradation in a practical cell system.

         <title>High Performance of Simple Organic Phosphorescence Host&#8211;Guest Materials and their Application in Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of simple organic phosphorescence host&#8211;guest materials with high performance are successfully developed. With these materials, high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are successfully realized by taking advantage of both their long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).








Abstract
The study of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has drawn increasing attention because of its considerable theoretical research and practical application value. Currently, organic RTP materials with both high efficiency (&#934;P&#160;&gt; 20%) and a long lifetime (&#964;P&#160;&gt; 10 s) in air are still scarce due to the lack of related design guidance. Here, a new strategy to increase the phosphorescence performance of organic materials by integrating the RTP host and RTP guest in one doping system to form a triplet exciplex, is reported. With these materials, the high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are both successfully realized by taking advantage of both the long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).

         <title>Challenges and Recent Advances in High Capacity Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical applications of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials, especially Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, are hindered by their inherent shortcomings. In this case, the recent understanding of complex reaction mechanisms, the novel modification methods, and the corresponding development trends are comprehensively reviewed. Additionally, other branches and the future opportunities of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted increasing attention because of their high reversible discharge capacity (&gt;250&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), which originates from transition metal (TM) ion redox reactions and unconventional oxygen anion redox reactions. However, many issues need to be addressed before their practical applications, such as their low kinetic properties and inefficient voltage fading. The development of cutting&#8208;edge technologies has led to cognitive advances in theory and offer potential solutions to these problems. Herein, a recent in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanisms and the frontier electrochemical research progress of Li&#8208;rich cathodes are reviewed. In addition, recent advances associated with various strategies to promote the performance and the development of modification methods are discussed. In particular, excluding Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, other branches of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized. The consistent pursuit is to obtain energy storage devices with high capacity, reliable practicability, and absolute safety. The recent literature and ongoing efforts in this area are also described, which will create more opportunities and new ideas for the future development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted increasing attention because of their high reversible discharge capacity (&amp;gt;250&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which originates from transition metal (TM) ion redox reactions and unconventional oxygen anion redox reactions. However, many issues need to be addressed before their practical applications, such as their low kinetic properties and inefficient voltage fading. The development of cutting&#8208;edge technologies has led to cognitive advances in theory and offer potential solutions to these problems. Herein, a recent in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanisms and the frontier electrochemical research progress of Li&#8208;rich cathodes are reviewed. In addition, recent advances associated with various strategies to promote the performance and the development of modification methods are discussed. In particular, excluding Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, other branches of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized. The consistent pursuit is to obtain energy storage devices with high capacity, reliable practicability, and absolute safety. The recent literature and ongoing efforts in this area are also described, which will create more opportunities and new ideas for the future development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Droplet&#8208;Based Techniques for Printing of Functional Inks for Flexible Physical Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of droplet&#8208;based printing techniques, namely inkjet, aerosol jet, and E&#8208;jet, are reviewed in depth. Furthermore, other important aspects of printed electronics such as functional inks, sintering methods, and flexible substrates are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the physical sensors fabricated by droplet&#8208;based techniques, and main challenges toward printed electronics are also reviewed.








Abstract
Printed electronics (PE) is an emerging technology that uses functional inks to print electrical components and circuits on variety of substrates. This technology has opened up new possibilities to fabricate flexible, bendable, and form&#8208;fitting devices at low&#8208;cost and fast speed. There are different printing technologies in use, among which droplet&#8208;based techniques are of great interest as they provide the possibility of printing computer&#8208;controlled design patterns with high resolution, and greater production flexibility. Nanomaterial inks form the heart of this technology, enabling different functionalities. To this end, intensive research has been carried out on formulating inks with conductive, semiconductive, magnetic, piezoresistive, and piezoelectric properties. Here, a detailed landscape view on different droplet&#8208;based printing technologies (inkjet, aerosol jet, and electrohydrodynamic jet) is provided, with comprehensive discussion on their working principals. This is followed by a detailed research overview of different functional inks (metal, carbon, polymer, and ceramic). Different sintering methods and common substrates being used in printed electronics are also discussed, followed by an in&#8208;depth review of different physical sensors fabricated by droplet&#8208;based techniques. Finally, the challenges facing the field are considered and a perspective on possible ways to overcome them is provided.

         <title>A Wearable Body Condition Sensor System with Wireless Feedback Alarm Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. A versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. The multifunctional wireless sensor system can especially save newborn infants&#8217; lives during sleep.








Abstract
Emerging feedback systems based on tracking body conditions can save human lives. In particular, vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. For example, the high global mortality of infants primarily owing to sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping makes request for extraordinary attentions in neonatal intensive care units or daily lives. Here, a versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG)&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system, which can wirelessly monitor the sleeping postures, respiration rate, and diaper moisture with feedback alarm notifications, is reported. A tilt sensor based on confining a liquid metal droplet inside a cavity can track at least 18 slanting orientations. A rapid and scalable laser direct writing method realizes LIG patterning in both the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations as well as the formation of nonstick conductive structures to the liquid metal. By rationally merging the LIG&#8208;based tilt, strain, and humidity sensors on a thin flexible film, the multimodal sensor device is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of the sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. User&#8208;friendly interfaces, which incorporate alarming functions, provide timely feedback for caregivers tending to vulnerable populations with limited self&#8208;care capabilities.

         <title>Recent Advances in 2D Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct superconductivity of 2D superconductors is discussed comprehensively based on the material structure characteristics and modulation methods. Perspectives on the unconventional superconductivity, Ising superconductivity, and topological superconductivity are also provided on the basis of experiment&#8208;based literature to date.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in 2D materials has attracted much attention and there has been rapid development in recent years because of their fruitful physical properties, such as high transition temperature (Tc), continuous phase transition, and enhanced parallel critical magnetic field (Bc). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring different physical parameters to figure out the mechanisms behind the unexpected superconductivity phenomena, including adjusting the thickness of samples, fabricating various heterostructures, tuning the carrier density by electric field and chemical doping, and so on. Here, different types of 2D superconductivity with their unique characteristics are introduced, including the conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superconductivity in ultrathin films, high&#8208;Tc superconductivity in Fe&#8208;based and Cu&#8208;based 2D superconductors, unconventional superconductivity in newly discovered twist&#8208;angle bilayer graphene, superconductivity with enhanced Bc, and topological superconductivity. A perspective toward this field is then proposed based on academic knowledge from the recently reported literature. The aim is to provide researchers with a clear and comprehensive understanding about the newly developed 2D superconductivity and promote the development of this field much further.

         <title>Engineering Permanent Porosity into Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in the emerging field of porous liquids is reviewed. These liquids reported to date are classified, and particular attention is given to their design strategies and the relationship between the structures of the porous liquids and their properties. Challenges including preparation, scale&#8208;up of synthesis, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and relatively small pore volumes are also discussed.








Abstract
The possibility of engineering well&#8208;defined pores into liquid materials is fascinating from both a conceptual and an applications point of view. Although the concept of porous liquids was proposed in 2007, these materials had remained hypothetical due to the technical challenges associated with their synthesis. Over the past five years, however, reports of the successful construction of porous liquids based on existing porous scaffolds, such as coordination cages, organic cages, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous carbons, zeolites, and porous polymers, have started to emerge. Here, the focus is on these early reports of porous liquids as prototypes in the field, classified according to the previously defined types of porous liquids. Particular attention will be paid to design strategies and structure&#8211;property relationships. Porous liquids have already exhibited promising applications in gas storage, transportation, and chemical separations. Thus, they show great potential for use in the chemical industry. The challenges of preparation, scale&#8208;up, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and competition with porous solids will also be discussed.

         <title>Recent Development of Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts in Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers requires a fundamental understanding of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, which is the primary focus of this review. The water electrolyzer in alkaline and acid are compared; and the recent advances in OER mechanisms, the strategies for enhancing activity and stability of electrocatalysts, surface reconstruction, and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts are discussed.








Abstract
The proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is one of the most promising hydrogen production techniques. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode dominates the overall efficiency. Developing active and robust electrocatalysts for OER in acid is a longstanding challenge for PEM water electrolyzers. Most catalysts show unsatisfied stability under strong acidic and oxidative conditions. Such a stability challenge also leads to difficulties for a better understanding of mechanisms. This review aims to provide the current progress on understanding of OER mechanisms in acid, analyze the promising strategies to enhance both activity and stability, and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts for OER in acid. First, the prevailing OER mechanisms are reviewed to establish the physicochemical structure&#8211;activity relationships for guiding the design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in acid with stable performance. The reported approaches to improve the activity, from macroview to microview, are then discussed. To analyze the problem of instability, the key factors affecting catalyst stability are summarized and the surface reconstruction is discussed. Various noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based OER catalysts and the current progress of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the development of active and robust OER catalysts in acid are discussed.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted Kinetic Trapping in Quaternary Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kinetic&#8208;trapping method that is compatible with solution&#8208;processing is presented. The method is demonstrated by fabricating an ultraviolet emitting perovskite alloy: Cs1&#8722;xRbxPbCl3. The method involves heating a precursor solution to provide it with sufficient thermal energy to form the alloy state. The method yields a material with superior stability and optical properties compared to simple precursor mixing.








Abstract
Engineering halide perovskites through alloying allows synthesis of materials having tuned electronic and optical properties; however, synthesizing many of these alloys is hindered by the formation of demixed phases arising due to thermodynamically unstable crystal structures. Methods have been developed to make such alloys, such as solid&#8208;phase reactions, chemical vapor deposition, and mechanical grinding; but these are incompatible with low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processing and monolithic integration, precluding a number of important applications of these materials. Here, solvent&#8208;phase kinetic trapping (SPKT), an approach that enables the synthesis of novel thermodynamically unfavored perovskite alloys, is developed. SPKT is used to synthesize Cs1&#8722;xRbxPbCl3 and report the first instance of ultraviolet emission in polycrystalline perovskite thin films. SPKT leads to materials exhibiting superior thermal and photostability compared to non&#8208;kinetically trapped materials of the same precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy of the kinetically trapped material reveals improved optical properties: greater absorption, and longer ground&#8208;state bleach lifetimes. SPKT may be applied to other perovskites to realize improved material properties while benefiting from facile solution&#8208;processing.

         <title>Thermally Stable Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts have attracted extensive interest recently, especially for material synthesis and catalytic performance. Their thermal stability under reaction conditions is closely related to the application of these materials in industry in the future. This Progress Report summarizes recent progress in developing thermally stable single&#8208;atom catalysts, including preparation strategies, coordination structure of single atoms, and catalytic performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive attention in fields related to energy, environment, and material sciences because of the high atom efficiency and the unique properties of these materials. Many approaches have hitherto been successfully established to prepare SACs, including impregnation, pyrolysis&#8208;involved processes, atom trapping, and coprecipitation. However, under typical reaction conditions, single atoms on catalysts tend to migrate or agglomerate, forming nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which lowers their surface free energy. Efforts are required to develop strategies for improving the thermal stability of SACs while achieving excellent catalytic performance. In this Progress Report, recent advances in the development of thermally durable single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts are discussed. Several important preparation approaches for thermally stable SACs are described in this article. Fundamental understanding of the coordination structures of thermally stable single atom prepared by these methods is discussed. Furthermore, the catalytic performances of these thermally stable SACs are reviewed, including their activity and stability. Finally, a perspective of this important and rapidly evolving research field is provided.

         <title>Degradable and Removable Tough Adhesive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of degradable tough adhesive hydrogels containing &#8776;90% water is engineered by incorporating covalently networked degradable crosslinkers and hydrolyzable ionically crosslinked main&#8208;chain polymers. Mechanical toughness, adhesion, and degradation of these formulations are tested in accelerated in vitro conditions and to 4 months in vivo. The broad versatility of these adhesives provides the foundation for many in vivo indications.








Abstract
The development of tough adhesive hydrogels has enabled unprecedented adhesion to wet and moving tissue surfaces throughout the body, but they are typically composed of nondegradable components. Here, a family of degradable tough adhesive hydrogels containing &#8776;90% water by incorporating covalently networked degradable crosslinkers and hydrolyzable ionically crosslinked main&#8208;chain polymers is developed. Mechanical toughness, adhesion, and degradation of these new formulations are tested in both accelerated in vitro conditions and up to 16 weeks in vivo. These degradable tough adhesives are engineered with equivalent mechanical and adhesive properties to nondegradable tough adhesives, capable of achieving stretches &gt;20 times their initial length, fracture energies &gt;6&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2,&#160;and&#160;adhesion&#160;energies &gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2.&#160;All degradable systems show complete degradation within 2 weeks under accelerated aging conditions in vitro and weeks to months in vivo depending on the degradable crosslinker selected. Excellent biocompatibility is observed for all groups after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of implantation, with minimal fibrous encapsulation and no signs of organ toxicity. On&#8208;demand removal of the adhesive is achieved with treatment of chemical agents which do not cause damage to underlying skin tissue in mice. The broad versatility of this family of adhesives provides the foundation for numerous in vivo indications.

         <title>Target Reprogramming Lysosomes of CD8+ T Cells by a Mineralized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome&#8208;targeted drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (LYS&#8208;NPs) composed of CD63&#8208;aptamers coupled with mineralized metal&#8211;organic frameworks are developed. Using the degradation of the LYS&#8208;NPs in lysosomes, therapeutic proteins and Ca2+ are stored in the lysosomes of T cells. Next, they are released when the T cell receptor (TCR) of the T cells binds to tumor cells. These elements possess a powerful ability for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
T cell immunotherapy holds significant challenges in solid tumors, mainly due to the T cells&#8217; low activation and the decreased synthesis&#8211;release of therapeutic proteins, including perforin and granzyme B, which are present in lysosomes. In this study, a lysosome&#8208;targeting nanoparticle (LYS&#8208;NP) is developed by way of a mineralized metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coupled with a lysosome&#8208;targeting aptamer (CD63&#8208;aptamer) to enhance the antitumor effect of T cells. The MOF synthesized from Zn2+ and dimethylimidazole has good protein encapsulation and acid sensitivity, and is thus an ideal lysosomal delivery vector. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is used to induce MOF mineralization, improve the composite material's stability in encapsulating therapeutic protein, and provide calcium ions with synergistic effects. Before mineralization, perforin and granzyme B&#8212;T cell&#8208;needed therapeutic proteins for tumors&#8212;are preloaded with the MOF. Moreover, T cells are pretreated with processed tumor&#8208;specific antigens to activate or produce memory before reprogramming the lysosomes, facilitating the T cell receptor (TCR) for release of the therapeutic proteins. Using T cells recombined by LYS&#8208;NPs, a significant enhancement of breast cancer control is confirmed.

         <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity and Superhigh Thermoelectric Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Merit in (Mg, Bi) Co&#8208;Doped GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via using the large mass and strain field fluctuations as indicators for low lattice thermal conductivity, the combination of (Mg, Bi) is screened as the effective dopants in GeTe. As a result of the optimized carrier concentration, increased band convergence, and lowered lattice thermal conductivity, Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te shows a superhigh zT of &#8776;2.5 at 700 K.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency thermoelectric (TE) technology is determined by the performance of TE materials. Doping is a routine approach in TEs to achieve optimized electrical properties and lowered thermal conductivity. However, how to choose appropriate dopants with desirable solution content to realize high TE figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (zT) is very tough work. In this study, via the use of large mass and strain field fluctuations as indicators for low lattice thermal conductivity, the combination of (Mg, Bi) in GeTe is screened as very effective dopants for potentially high zTs. In experiments, a series of (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doped GeTe compounds are prepared and the electrical and thermal transport properties are systematically investigated. Ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, about 0.3 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 600 K, is obtained in Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te due to the introduced large mass and strain field fluctuations by (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doping. In addition, (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doping can introduce extra electrons for optimal carrier concentration and diminish the energy offset at the top of the valence band for high density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass. Via these synthetic effects, a superhigh zT of &#8776;2.5 at 700 K is achieved for Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te. This study sheds light on the rational design of effective dopants in other TE materials.

As a result of the optimized carrier concentration, increased band convergence, and lowered lattice thermal conductivity, Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te shows a superhigh &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;2.5 at 700 K.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High&#8208;efficiency thermoelectric (TE) technology is determined by the performance of TE materials. Doping is a routine approach in TEs to achieve optimized electrical properties and lowered thermal conductivity. However, how to choose appropriate dopants with desirable solution content to realize high TE figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt;) is very tough work. In this study, via the use of large mass and strain field fluctuations as indicators for low lattice thermal conductivity, the combination of (Mg, Bi) in GeTe is screened as very effective dopants for potentially high &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt;s. In experiments, a series of (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doped GeTe compounds are prepared and the electrical and thermal transport properties are systematically investigated. Ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, about 0.3 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 600 K, is obtained in Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te due to the introduced large mass and strain field fluctuations by (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doping. In addition, (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doping can introduce extra electrons for optimal carrier concentration and diminish the energy offset at the top of the valence band for high density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass. Via these synthetic effects, a superhigh &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;2.5 at 700 K is achieved for Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te. This study sheds light on the rational design of effective dopants in other TE materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering Band&#8208;Type Alignment in CsPbBr3 Perovskite&#8208;Based Artificial Multiple Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering band&#8208;type alignment in CsPbBr3 multiple quantum wells (MQWs) is demonstrated by adapting various organic molecular spacers as quantum barriers. Three different MQWs exhibit a different band offset with CsPbBr3, resulting in a variety of MQW band alignments, e.g., type&#8208;I or type&#8208;II structures. Photodetectors using these MQWs display distinct carrier dynamics and device characteristics that vary distinctly the barrier material.








Abstract
Semiconductor heterostructures of multiple quantum wells (MQWs) have major applications in optoelectronics. However, for halide perovskites&#8212;the leading class of emerging semiconductors&#8212;building a variety of bandgap alignments (i.e., band&#8208;types) in MQWs is not yet realized owing to the limitations of the current set of used barrier materials. Here, artificial perovskite&#8208;based MQWs using 2,2&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;benzinetriyl)&#8208;tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;benzimidazole), tris&#8208;(8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline)aluminum, and 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as quantum barrier materials are introduced. The structures of three different five&#8208;stacked perovskite&#8208;based MQWs each exhibiting a different band offset with CsPbBr3 in the conduction and valence bands, resulting in a variety of MQW band alignments, i.e., type&#8208;I or type&#8208;II structures, are shown. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals the disparity in charge carrier dynamics between type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II MQWs. Photodiodes of each type of perovskite artificial MQWs show entirely different carrier behaviors and photoresponse characteristics. Compared with bulk perovskite devices, type&#8208;II MQW photodiodes demonstrate a more than tenfold increase in the rectification ratio. The findings open new opportunities for producing halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based quantum devices by bandgap engineering using simple quantum barrier considerations.

         <title>Recent Progress in Cartilage Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the origins of the outstanding lubricity of healthy articular cartilage is crucial both to potentially treat osteoarthritis symptoms, and for the design of better biomaterials. This progress report reviews the mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication, and explores the recent development of natural and of bio&#8208;inspired lubricants.








Abstract
Healthy articular cartilage, covering the ends of bones in major joints such&#160;as hips and knees, presents the most efficiently&#8208;lubricated surface known in nature, with friction coefficients as low as 0.001 up to physiologically high pressures. Such low friction is indeed essential for its well&#8208;being. It minimizes wear&#8208;and&#8208;tear and hence the cartilage degradation associated with osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease, and, by reducing shear stress on the mechanotransductive, cartilage&#8208;embedded chondrocytes (the only cell type in the cartilage), it regulates their function to maintain homeostasis. Understanding the origins of such low friction of the articular cartilage, therefore, is of major importance in order to alleviate disease symptoms, and slow or even reverse its breakdown. This progress report considers the relation between frictional behavior and the cellular mechanical environment in the cartilage, then reviews the mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication. Following recent advances based on hydration lubrication, a proposed synergy between different molecular components of the synovial joints, acting together in enabling the low friction, has been proposed. Additionally, recent development of natural and bio&#8208;inspired lubricants is reviewed.

         <title>The Triboelectric Nanogenerator as an Innovative Technology toward Intelligent Sports</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress on the development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for the field of intelligent sports is reviewed, highlighting TENG&#8208;based athletic big data, self&#8208;powered smart sports facilities, and wearable equipment. Current challenges and future outlooks regarding this emerging area are also discussed.








Abstract
In the new era of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, athletic big data collection and analysis based on widely distributed sensing networks are particularly important in the development of intelligent sports. Conventional sensors usually require an external power supply, with limitations such as limited lifetime and high maintenance cost. As a newly developed mechanical energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing technology, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) shows great potential to overcome these limitations. Most importantly, TENGs can be fabricated using wood, paper, fibers, and polymers, which are the most frequently used materials for sports. Recent progress on the development of TENGs for the field of intelligent sports is summarized. First, the working mechanism of TENG and its association with athletic big data are introduced. Subsequently, the development of TENG&#8208;based sports sensing systems, including smart sports facilities and wearable equipment is highlighted. At last, the remaining challenges and open opportunities are also discussed.

         <title>Weighted Mobility Ratio Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Bi&#8211;Te&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Materials via Suppression of Minority Carrier Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppression of the bipolar conduction in narrow bandgap thermoelectric materials is crucial for improving their device efficiency. This work correlates the weighted mobility ratio in thermoelectric figure of merit and bipolar conduction in bismuth&#8208;telluride&#8208;based alloys. The results suggest that increasing weighted mobility ratio suppresses the bipolar conduction most effectively among other parameters like carrier concentration and bandgap.








Abstract
Thermoelectrics, which can generate electricity from a temperature difference, or vice versa, is a key technology for solid&#8208;state cooling and energy harvesting; however, its applications are constrained owing to low efficiency. Since the conversion efficiency of thermoelectric devices is directly obtained via a figure of merit of materials, zT, which is related to the electronic and thermal transport characteristics, the aim here is to elucidate physical parameters that should be considered to understand transport phenomena in semiconducting materials. It is found that the weighted mobility ratio of the majority and minority carrier bands is an important parameter that determines zT. For nanograined Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloy, the unremarked role of this parameter on temperature&#8208;dependent electronic transport properties is demonstrated. This analysis shows that the control of the weighted mobility ratio is a promising way to enhance zT of narrow bandgap thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Van Der Waals Epitaxial Growth and Phase Transition of Layered FeSe2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel and phase&#8208;pure layered iron diselenide (FeSe2) nanocrystals, confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, are epitaxially grown on mica by sublimed&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. They exhibit metallic behavior with high electrical conductivity and a phase transition at &#8776;11 K.








Abstract
Layered iron chalcogenides (FeX, X = S, Se, Te) provide excellent platforms to study intertwined phase transitions, superconductivity, and magnetism. However, layered iron dichalcogenides (FeX2, X = S, Se, Te) are rarely reported and their intrinsic properties are still unknown.

&lt;p&gt;Novel and phase&#8208;pure layered iron diselenide (FeSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanocrystals, confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, are epitaxially grown on mica by sublimed&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered iron chalcogenides (FeX, X = S, Se, Te) provide excellent platforms to study intertwined phase transitions, superconductivity, and magnetism. However, layered iron dichalcogenides (FeX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, X = S, Se, Te) are rarely reported and their intrinsic properties are still unknown. Here, phase&#8208;pure layered iron diselenide (FeSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanocrystals are epitaxially grown on mica by the sublimed&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition method at atmospheric pressure. The layered atomic structure of FeSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Electrical transport shows that the layered FeSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a metal with high conductivity and a phase transition at &#8776;11 K. The phase transition manifests itself as a kink in the temperature&#8208;dependent resistivity, as well as anomalous magnetoresistance (MR) appearing around the phase&#8208;transition temperature.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Electrically Enhanced Intracellular Catalysis of FePt&#8208;FeC Heterostructures for Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a weak alternating magnetic field, the induced charges gathered at the interface of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures are demonstrated to promote intracellular catalytic reduction of &#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, leading to tumor cell senescence, thereby reducing resistance to treatments such as Fenton reaction&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy. A one&#8211;two punch strategy is proposed and shows good therapeutic effects on tumors.








Abstract
Intracellular catalytic reactions can tailor tumor cell plasticity toward high&#8208;efficiency treatments, but the application is hindered by the low efficiency of intracellular catalysis. Here, a magneto&#8208;electronic approach is developed for efficient intracellular catalysis by inducing eddy currents of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures in mild alternating magnetic fields (frequency of f&#160;= 96&#160;kHz and amplitude of B&#160;&#8804; 70 mT). Finite element simulation shows a high density of induced charges gathering at the interface of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructure in the alternating magnetic field. As a result, the concentration of an essential coenzyme&#8212;&#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#8212;in cancer cells is significantly reduced by the enhanced catalytic hydrogenation reaction of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures under alternating magnetic stimulation, leading to over 80% of senescent cancer cells&#8212;a vulnerable phenotype that facilitates further treatment. It is further demonstrated that senescent cancer cells can be efficiently killed by the chemodynamic therapy based on the enhanced Fenton&#8208;like reaction. By promoting intracellular catalytic reactions in tumors, this approach may enable precise catalytic tumor treatment.

         <title>Intrinsically Polar Piezoelectric Self&#8208;Assembled Oligopeptide Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel, intrinsically polar oligopeptide based piezoelectric force and touch sensors producing large piezoelectric voltage response are presented. They are easily manufactured through solution processing, without the need for electrical poling. The devices exhibit immense piezoelectric voltage constants (g33) up to 2&#160;V m N&#8722;1 and a flexible device prototype is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of nearly 6&#160;V under gentle bending motion.








Abstract
Flexible, biocompatible piezoelectric materials are of considerable research interest for a variety of applications, but many suffer from low response or high cost to manufacture. Herein, novel piezoelectric force and touch sensors based on self&#8208;assembled monolayers of oligopeptides are presented, which produce large piezoelectric voltage response and are easily manufactured without the need for electrical poling. While the devices generate modest piezoelectric charge constants (d33) of up to 9.8&#160;pC N&#8722;1, they exhibit immense piezoelectric voltage constants (g33) up to 2&#160;V m N&#8722;1. Furthermore, a flexible device prototype is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of nearly 6&#160;V under gentle bending motion. Improvements in peptide selection and device construction promise to further improve the already outstanding voltage response and open the door to numerous practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Circular Photogalvanic Effect in Enantiomorphic 2D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality dependence of a novel optoelectronic phenomenon, circular photogalvanic effect, is observed in a pair of 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites with introduced chiral molecules. The sign reversal of zero&#8208;bias photocurrents between enantiomers indicates the chirality&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;polarized bands induced by spin&#8211;orbit coupling.








Abstract
The control of the optoelectronic properties of 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D&#8208;OIHP) lead halides is an increasingly prevalent topic. Herein, the observation of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in new enantiomorphic 2D&#8208;OIHP lead iodides is reported, which are synthesized as a first OIHP&#8208;related system belonging to a chiral space group by incorporating organic chiral cations into the inorganic layers of lead iodides. The CPGE is an optoelectronic phenomenon associated with the spin&#8211;orbit coupling of heavy atoms in noncentrosymmetric systems. Owing to the CPGE, light&#8208;helicity&#8208;dependent steady photocurrents are generated without an external bias voltage under the irradiation of circularly polarized light. Furthermore, the sign reversal of the CPGE photocurrent depending on the chirality of the designed 2D&#8208;OIHP lead iodides is observed. This result indicates formation of the theoretically predicted radial spin&#8208;polarized texture in k&#8208;space of chiral systems owing to spin&#8208;momentum locking. Hence, chiral 2D&#8208;OIHP lead halides can be a promising platform for engineering opto&#8208;spintronic functionalities.

         <title>A Hippocampus&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Gated Organic Artificial Synapse for Simultaneous Sensing of a Neurotransmitter and Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hippocampal&#8208;synapse&#8208;inspired organic artificial synapse that can simultaneously detect a neurotransmitter and light is prepared using a dual&#8208;gate organic synaptic transistor with a functionalized extended&#8208;gate electrode. In addition to mimicking typical synaptic functions such as short&#8208; and long&#8208;term potentiation and synaptic weight control, hippocampal synaptic strengthening effects in response to repetitive dopamine injection and light illumination are emulated.








Abstract
Organic neuromorphic devices and sensors that mimic the functions of chemical synapses and sensory perception in humans have received much attention for next&#8208;generation computing and integrated logic circuits. Despite recent advances, organic artificial synapses capable of detecting both neurotransmitters in liquid environments and light are not reported. Herein, inspired by hippocampal synapses, a dual&#8208;gate organic synaptic transistor platform with a photoconductive polymer semiconductor, a ferroelectric insulator of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE), and an extended&#8208;gate electrode functionalized with boronic acid is developed to simultaneously detect the neurotransmitter dopamine and light. The developed synaptic transistor enables memory consolidation upon repetitive exposure to dopamine and polychromatic light, exhibiting effectively modulated postsynaptic currents. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hippocampal&#8208;synapse&#8208;mimetic organic neuromorphic system combining a chemical sensor and a photosensor opens new possibilities for developing low&#8208;power organic artificial synaptic multisensors and light&#8208;induced memory consolidative artificial synapses, and can also contribute to the development of human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Designing MOF Nanoarchitectures for Electrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent pivotal advancements in designing nanoarchitectures based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for efficient electrochemical water splitting are presented. The chemical composition and structure functionalization at the atomic and molecular levels are discussed; then, the catalytic activities, identification of active sites, fundamental mechanisms, and commercialization are thoroughly summarized. Finally, a comprehensive commentary on the current primary challenges and future perspectives is provided.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting has attracted significant attention as a key pathway for the development of renewable energy systems. Fabricating efficient electrocatalysts for these processes is intensely desired to reduce their overpotentials and facilitate practical applications. Recently, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoarchitectures featuring ultrahigh surface areas, tunable nanostructures, and excellent porosities have emerged as promising materials for the development of highly active catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, the most pivotal advances in recent research on engineering MOF nanoarchitectures for efficient electrochemical water splitting are presented. First, the design of catalytic centers for MOF&#8208;based/derived electrocatalysts is summarized and compared from the aspects of chemical composition optimization and structural functionalization at the atomic and molecular levels. Subsequently, the fast&#8208;growing breakthroughs in catalytic activities, identification of highly active sites, and fundamental mechanisms are thoroughly discussed. Finally, a comprehensive commentary on the current primary challenges and future perspectives in water splitting and its commercialization for hydrogen production is provided. Hereby, new insights into the synthetic principles and electrocatalysis for designing MOF nanoarchitectures for the practical utilization of water splitting are offered, thus further promoting their future prosperity for a wide range of applications.

         <title>A Tensile&#8208;Strained Pt&#8211;Rh Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Remarkably Boosts Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Rh atoms on intermetallic PtBi matrix are achieved by atomic galvanic replacement, and the system transforms into a tensile&#8208;strained Pt&#8211;Rh single&#8208;atom alloy via electrochemical dealloying. Benefiting from the Rh1&#8208;tailored Pt (110) surface with tensile strain, the PtBi@PtRh1 nanoplates exhibit record&#8208;high and all&#8208;round superior electrocatalytic performances including activity, selectivity, stability, and anti&#8208;poisoning ability toward ethanol oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte.








Abstract
The rational design and control of electrocatalysts at single&#8208;atomic sites could enable unprecedented atomic utilization and catalytic properties, yet it remains challenging in multimetallic alloys. Herein, the first example of isolated Rh atoms on ordered PtBi nanoplates (PtBi&#8208;Rh1) by atomic galvanic replacement, and their subsequent transformation into a tensile&#8208;strained Pt&#8211;Rh single&#8208;atom alloy (PtBi@PtRh1) via electrochemical dealloying are presented. Benefiting from the Rh1&#8208;tailored Pt (110) surface with tensile strain, the PtBi@PtRh1 nanoplates exhibit record&#8208;high and all&#8208;round superior electrocatalytic performance including activity, selectivity, stability, and anti&#8208;poisoning ability toward ethanol oxidation in alkaline electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations reveal the synergism between effective Rh1 and tensile strain in boosting the adsorption of ethanol and key surface intermediates and the C&#63743;C bond cleavage of the intermediates. The facile synthesis of the tensile&#8208;strained single&#8208;atom alloy provides a novel strategy to construct model nanostructures, accelerating the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layer&#8208;Deposition&#8208;Based 2D Transition Metal Chalcogenides: Synthesis, Modulation, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the synthesis of 2D transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is presented. While the ALD of thin films on 2D TMCs can modify the TMC properties, that of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials on 2D TMCs can enhance the device performance. The characteristics of ALD&#8208;based TMCs applied to nanoelectronics, sensors, and energy applications are discussed.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are a large family of 2D materials with different properties, and are promising candidates for a wide range of applications such as nanoelectronics, sensors, energy conversion, and energy storage. In the research of new materials, the development and investigation of industry&#8208;compatible synthesis techniques is of key importance. In this respect, it is important to study 2D TMC materials synthesized by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, which is widely applied in industries. In addition to the synthesis of 2D TMCs, ALD is used to modulate the characteristic of 2D TMCs such as their carrier density and morphology. So far, the improvement of thin film uniformity without oxidation and the synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials on 2D TMCs have been the research focus. Herein, the synthesis and modulation of 2D TMCs by ALD is described, and the characteristics of ALD&#8208;based TMCs used in nanoelectronics, sensors, and energy applications are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction is the key to realizing the application of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The most recent advances in advanced electrocatalysts for enhancing acidic oxygen evolution reaction, including Ir&#8208;based, Ru&#8208;based, nonprecious metal&#8208;based, and carbon&#8208;based nanostructures, are comprehensively summarized in this Progress Report. The strategies summarized in this work are of benefit to more advanced electrocatalysts design.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers hold great significance for renewable energy storage and conversion. The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main roadblocks that hinder the practical application of PEM water electrolyzers. Highly active, cost&#8208;effective, and durable electrocatalysts are indispensable for lowering the high kinetic barrier of OER to achieve boosted reaction kinetics. To date, a wide spectrum of advanced electrocatalysts has been designed and synthesized for enhanced acidic OER performance, though Ir and Ru based nanostructures still represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. In this Progress Report, recent research progress in advanced electrocatalysts for improved acidic OER performance is summarized. First, fundamental understanding about acidic OER including reaction mechanisms and atomic understanding to acidic OER for rational design of efficient electrocatalysts are discussed. Thereafter, an overview of the progress in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER electrocatalysts is provided in terms of catalyst category, i.e., metallic nanostructures (Ir and Ru based), precious metal oxides, nonprecious metal oxides, and carbon based nanomaterials. Finally, perspectives to the future development of acidic OER are provided from the aspects of reaction mechanism investigation and more efficient electrocatalyst design.

         <title>Manipulating Nonlinear Optical Response via Domain Control in Nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of manipulating nonlinear optical response via domain control in nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) composite is proposed. An unusual nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction transverse second&#8208;harmonic generation is observed in NIG composite with specific domain structure. The constructed NIG composite is further demonstrated for precise measurement of the group velocity and duration of ultrashort optical pulse.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) is an exciting class of composites, because it can not only combine the advantages of crystal and glass materials but also potentially generate new physical phenomenon in a cooperative manner. Herein, the nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction processes in a broad range of NIG composites homogeneously embedded with LiNbO3 are investigated. It is shown that, by rational control of the organization manner of crystal and glass phases, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) can be precisely tuned.

     alt="Manipulating Nonlinear Optical Response via Domain Control in Nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;Glass Composites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy of manipulating nonlinear optical response via domain control in nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) composite is proposed. An unusual nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction transverse second&#8208;harmonic generation is observed in NIG composite with specific domain structure. The constructed NIG composite is further demonstrated for precise measurement of the group velocity and duration of ultrashort optical pulse.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) is an exciting class of composites, because it can not only combine the advantages of crystal and glass materials but also potentially generate new physical phenomenon in a cooperative manner. Herein, the nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction processes in a broad range of NIG composites homogeneously embedded with LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are investigated. It is shown that, by rational control of the organization manner of crystal and glass phases, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) can be precisely tuned. Importantly, an unusual SHG phenomenon, transverse SHG (TSHG), can be realized in the special region of the microstructure map combined with the features of high loading, nanoscale size, and homogenous distribution of nanocrystals. Furthermore, NIG composites exhibit broadband optical response, allowing TSHG in a wide waveband region to be achieved. Based on the above effects, the applications of the constructed NIG composite for precise measurement of the group velocity and duration of ultrashort optical pulses with femtosecond time scales are demonstrated. Indeed, the findings outline a fundamental principle to design NIG configurations for creating new properties, providing new directions for expanding the scope of NIG functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Plasmonic Alloys Reveal a Distinct Metabolic Phenotype of Early Gastric Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimetallic PdPtAu alloys with optimized elemental composition and surface structure benefit enhanced laser desorption/ionization, with photoinduced charge/energy transfer and size&#8208;exclusive effect. By further coupling with mass spectrometry, PdPtAu alloys yield direct metabolic profiling of trace plasma in seconds. A gastric cancer (GC)&#8208;specific metabolic phenotype is identified, shedding light on the precise and non&#8208;invasive GC diagnosis at an early stage.








Abstract
Gastric cancer (GC) is a multifactorial process, accompanied by alterations in metabolic pathways. Non&#8208;invasive metabolic profiling facilitates GC diagnosis at early stage leading to an improved prognostic outcome. Herein, mesoporous PdPtAu alloys are designed to characterize the metabolic profiles in human blood. The elemental composition is optimized with heterogeneous surface plasmonic resonance, offering preferred charge transfer for photoinduced desorption/ionization and enhanced photothermal conversion for thermally driven desorption. The surface structure of PdPtAu is further tuned with controlled mesopores, accommodating metabolites only, rather than large interfering compounds. Consequently, the optimized PdPtAu alloy yields direct metabolic fingerprints by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry in seconds, consuming 500 nL of native plasma. A distinct metabolic phenotype is revealed for early GC by sparse learning, resulting in precise GC diagnosis with an area under the curve of 0.942. It is envisioned that the plasmonic alloy will open up a new era of minimally invasive blood analysis to improve the surveillance of cancer patients in the clinical setting.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics using Eutectic Acceptor Fibrils to Achieve Current Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells are fabricated, achieving a significant JSC boost, by virtue of an optimized crystalline feature with the formation of a eutectic mixture with better acceptor crystalline fibrils. The optimal morphology suppresses energetic disorder and recombination, and increases charge transfer and transport, yielding a high efficiency of 17.84% with significant current boost.








Abstract
The intrinsic electronic properties of donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials in coupling with morphological features dictate the output in organic solar cells (OSCs). New physical properties of intimate eutectic mixing are used in nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 ternary blends to fine&#8208;tune the bulk heterojunction thin film morphology as well as their electronic properties. With enhanced thin film crystallinity and improved carrier transport, a significant JSC amplification is achieved due to the formation of eutectic fibrillar lamellae and reduced defects state density. Material wise, aligned cascading energy levels with much larger driving force, and suppressed recombination channels confirm efficient charge transfer and transport, enabling an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.84%. These results reveal the importance of utilizing specific material interactions to control the crystalline habit in blended films to form a well&#8208;suited morphology in guiding superior performances, which is of high demand in the next episode of OSC fabrication toward 20% PCE.

         <title>Biologically Excretable Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Dots for Visualizing Through the Marmosets Intravitally: Horizons in Future Clinical Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long aliphatic chains of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;gens are conducive to the excretion of AIE dots from an animal's body. The deep micro cerebrovasculature in marmosets is visualized through the thinned skull. Non&#8208;invasive and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb imaging is utilized in non&#8208;human primates. This work is believed to provide crucial ideas to advance the development of biosafe AIE dots and future nanomedicine.








Abstract
Superb reliability and biocompatibility equip aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) dots with tremendous potential for fluorescence bioimaging. However, there is still a chronic lack of design instructions of excretable and bright AIE emitters. Here, a kind of PEGylated AIE (OTPA&#8208;BBT) dots with strong absorption and extremely high second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) PLQY of 13.6% is designed, and a long&#8208;aliphatic&#8208;chain design blueprint contributing to their excretion from an animal's body is proposed. Assisted by the OTPA&#8208;BBT dots with bright fluorescence beyond 1100&#160;nm and even 1500&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), large&#8208;depth cerebral vasculature (beyond 600&#160;&#181;m) as well as real&#8208;time blood flow are monitored through a thinned skull, and noninvasive NIR&#8208;IIb imaging with rich high&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency information gives a precise presentation of gastrointestinal tract in marmosets. Importantly, after intravenous or oral administration, the definite excretion of OTPA&#8208;BBT dots from the body is demonstrated, which provides influential evidence of biosafety.

         <title>Durable and Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Soft Peripheral Neuroprosthetics for In Vivo Bidirectional Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft but durable fatigue&#8208;resistant neuroprosthetic device is proposed for peripheral nerve interfacing based on a self&#8208;recoverable nanocomposite. The nanocomposite can spontaneously recover its electrical conductivity even after repetitive degradations by severe mechanical deformation. The neuroprosthetics implanted on a rat sciatic nerve achieve stable bidirectional signaling for 5 weeks. Deep neural network analysis predicts joint position of the rat precisely.








Abstract
Soft neuroprosthetics that monitor signals from sensory neurons and deliver motor information can potentially replace damaged nerves. However, achieving long&#8208;term stability of devices interfacing peripheral nerves is challenging, since dynamic mechanical deformations in peripheral nerves cause material degradation in devices. Here, a durable and fatigue&#8208;resistant soft neuroprosthetic device is reported for bidirectional signaling on peripheral nerves. The neuroprosthetic device is made of a nanocomposite of gold nanoshell (AuNS)&#8208;coated silver (Ag) flakes dispersed in a tough, stretchable, and self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP). The dynamic self&#8208;healing property of the nanocomposite allows the percolation network of AuNS&#8208;coated flakes to rebuild after degradation. Therefore, its degraded electrical and mechanical performance by repetitive, irregular, and intense deformations at the device&#8211;nerve interface can be spontaneously self&#8208;recovered. When the device is implanted on a rat sciatic nerve, stable bidirectional signaling is obtained for over 5 weeks. Neural signals collected from a live walking rat using these neuroprosthetics are analyzed by a deep neural network to predict the joint position precisely. This result demonstrates that durable soft neuroprosthetics can facilitate collection and analysis of large&#8208;sized in vivo data for solving challenges in neurological disorders.

         <title>Fermi Velocity Reduction of Dirac Fermions around the Brillouin Zone Center in In2Se3&#8211;Bilayer Graphene Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy to construct moir&#233; Dirac cones around the Brillouin zone center is realized by folding graphene Dirac cones in monolayer In2Se3/bilayer graphene heterostructures. The Fermi velocity of the moir&#233; Dirac cones is reduced by &#8776;23%, and the reshaped Dirac point at the &#915; point is elongated. Both features further confirm the moir&#233; Dirac fermion renormalization and interactions.








Abstract
Emergent phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, Mott&#8208;like insulators, and the peculiar quantum Hall effect in graphene&#8208;based heterostructures are proposed to stem from the superlattice&#8208;induced renormalization of (moir&#233;) Dirac fermions at the graphene Brillouin zone corners. Understanding the corresponding band structure commonly demands photoemission spectroscopy with both sub&#8208;meV resolution and large&#8208;momentum coverage, beyond the capability of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Here the realization of moir&#233; Dirac cones around the Brillouin zone center in monolayer In2Se3/bilayer graphene heterostructure is reported. The renormalization is evidenced by reduced Fermi velocity (&#8776;23%) of the moir&#233; Dirac cones and the reshaped Dirac point at the &#915; point where they intersect. While there have been many theoretical predictions and much indirect experimental evidence, the findings here are the first direct observation of Fermi velocity reduction of the moir&#233; Dirac cones. These features suggest strong In2Se3/graphene interlayer coupling, which is comparable with that in twisted bilayer graphene. The strategy expands the choice of materials in the heterostructure design and stimulates subsequent broad investigations of emergent physics at the sub&#8208;meV energy scale.

         <title>2D MXenes: Tunable Mechanical and Tribological Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes have grown to prominence due to their impressive conductive and electrochemical behavior. Although the mechanical and tribological properties are critical in almost all MXenes applications, they are yet to be fully explored. An in&#8208;depth perspective of the fundamental understanding of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties and their effects on current and future applications is provided.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, known as MXenes, were discovered in 2011 and have grown to prominence in energy storage, catalysis, electromagnetic interference shielding, wireless communications, electronic, sensors, and environmental and biomedical applications. In addition to their high electrical conductivity and electrochemically active behavior, MXenes&#8217; mechanical properties, flexibility, and strong adhesion properties play crucial roles in almost all of these growing applications. Although these properties prove to be critical in MXenes&#8217; impressive performance, the mechanical and tribological understanding of MXenes, as well as their relation to the synthesis process, is yet to be fully explored. Here, a fundamental overview of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties is provided and the effects of MXenes&#8217; compositions, synthesis, and processing steps on these properties are discussed. Additionally, a critical perspective of the compositional control of MXenes for innovative structural, low&#8208;friction, and low&#8208;wear performance in current and upcoming applications of MXenes is provided. It is established here that the fundamental understanding of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological behavior is essential for their quickly growing applications.

         <title>Tunable Stochasticity in an Artificial Spin Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of magnetic domain&#8208;walls within artificial spin networks leads to a tunable stochastic response of the metamaterial, which can be tailored through an external field and local lattice modifications. This type of tunable stochastic network can produce a controllable random response, as demonstrated by recreating a nanoscale version of the Galton board, the iconic experiment historically used to showcase the emergence of order from chaos.








Abstract
Metamaterials present the possibility of artificially generating advanced functionalities through engineering of their internal structure. Artificial spin networks, in which a large number of nanoscale magnetic elements are coupled together, are promising metamaterial candidates that enable the control of collective magnetic behavior through tuning of the local interaction between elements. In this work, the motion of magnetic domain&#8208;walls in an artificial spin network leads to a tunable stochastic response of the metamaterial, which can be tailored through an external magnetic field and local lattice modifications. This type of tunable stochastic network produces a controllable random response exploiting intrinsic stochasticity within magnetic domain&#8208;wall motion at the nanoscale. An iconic demonstration used to illustrate the control of randomness is the Galton board. In this system, multiple balls fall into an array of pegs to generate a bell&#8208;shaped curve that can be modified via the array spacing or the tilt of the board. A&#160;nanoscale recreation of this experiment using an artificial spin network is employed to demonstrate tunable stochasticity. This type of tunable stochastic network opens new paths toward post&#8208;Von Neumann computing architectures such as Bayesian sensing or random neural networks, in which stochasticity is harnessed to efficiently perform complex computational tasks.

         <title>Nanoburl Graphites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the strengthening mechanism of burls in tree trunks, nanodiamond particles converted into graphite onions are used as &#8220;nanoburls&#8221; that are embedded in graphite (0002) planes to stop cleavage along the graphite (0002) planes, significantly strengthening the bulk graphites.








Abstract
A critical challenge for the application of graphite is low strength, which originates from the easy cleavage of graphite (0002) planes. Inspired by the burl strengthening mechanism observed in tree trunks, nanodiamond particles converted into graphite onions are used as &#8220;nanoburls&#8221; embedded in graphite (0002) lattice planes to eliminate the graphite (0002) plane cleavage of bulk graphites prepared by spark plasma sintering from graphite powders. Covalent bonds are built between carbon atoms by sp3 hybridization at the interface between the graphite onions and flakes, which triggers an electron redistribution to form positive/negative charge domains within. Thus, pairs of pseudo&#8208;Schottky junctions are created by the hybridization, which further enhances the bonding between the graphite onions and flakes. With these bonding mechanisms, and with voids between the graphite powders filled in by the volume expansion associated with the change of nanodiamonds to the graphite onions, the loose compaction of graphite powder becomes consolidated at 1700&#160;&#176;C. The proposed nanoburl mechanism shows its potential and bestows the nanoburl graphites with strength five times that of conventional graphites prepared from graphite powders. The concept of nanoburl strengthening can be important in the microstructural design and property enhancement of other layered materials.

         <title>Anomalous Motion of Charged Domain Walls and Associated Negative Capacitance in Copper&#8211;Chlorine Boracite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During switching, specific charged 90&#176; domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite are seen to move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied electric field. Polarization&#8211;field hysteresis loops show negative gradients and measured switching currents confirm the negative capacitance contribution to the overall dielectric response.








Abstract
During switching, the microstructure of a ferroelectric normally adapts to align internal dipoles with external electric fields. Favorably oriented dipolar regions (domains) grow at the expense of those in unfavorable orientations and this is manifested in a predictable field&#8208;induced motion of the walls that separate one domain from the next. Here, the discovery that specific charged 90&#176;domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied field, is reported. Polarization&#8211;field (P&#8211;E) hysteresis loops, inferred from optical imaging, show negative gradients and non&#8208;transient negative capacitance, throughout the P&#8211;E cycle. Switching currents (generated by the relative motion between domain walls and sensing electrodes) confirm this, insofar as their signs are opposite to those expected conventionally. For any given bias, the integrated switching charge due to this anomalous wall motion is directly proportional to time, indicating that the magnitude of the negative capacitance component should be inversely related to frequency. This passes Jonscher's test for the misinterpretation of positive inductance and gives confidence that field&#8208;induced motion of these specific charged domain walls generates a measurable negative capacitance contribution to the overall dielectric response.

         <dc:description>
Modification of the separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, based on the electrostatic attraction and catalytic effect of polysulfides is presented by way of guanidinium&#8208;based ionic&#8211;covalent organic nanosheets on the surface of conductive Ti3C2. The modified separator endows carbon nanotube/sulfur electrodes with significantly enhanced reversible capacity, areal capacity, volumetric capacity, and cycling stability.








Abstract
It is of great significance to mediate the redox kinetics and shuttle effect of polysulfides in pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, a new strategy is proposed based on the electrostatic attraction and catalytic effect of polysulfides for the modification of the polypropylene (PP) separator. Guanidinium&#8208;based ionic&#8211;covalent organic nanosheets (iCON) on the surface of Ti3C2 is presented as a coating layer for the PP separator. The synergetic effects of Ti3C2 and iCON provide new platforms to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides, expedite the redox kinetics of sulfur species, and promote efficient conversion of the intercepted polysulfides. The functional separator endows carbon nanotube/sulfur cathodes with excellent electrochemical performance. The average capacity decay per cycle within 2000 cycles at 2 C is as low as 0.006%. The separator is even effective in the case of sulfur content of 90 wt% and sulfur loading of 7.6 mg cm&#8722;2; the reversible capacity, areal capacity, and volumetric capacity at 0.1 C are as high as 1186 mA h g&#8722;1, 9.01 mA h cm&#8722;2, and 1201 mA h cm&#8722;3, respectively. This work provides a promising approach toward separator modification for the development of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>An Ultrasoft Self&#8208;Fused Supramolecular Polymer Hydrogel for Completely Preventing Postoperative Tissue Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One more methylene makes a difference: introducing one extra methylene between two amides in the side chain of poly(N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide) weakens the H&#8208;bonding interaction, resulting in an ultrasoft and highly swollen supramolecular polymer hydrogel that can be tuned to form a transient network with a self&#8208;fused and antifouling ability, which is harnessed to completely prevent postoperative tissue adhesion.








Abstract
The intermolecular H&#8208;bonding density heavily influences the gelation and rheological behavior of hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer hydrogels, thus offering a delicate pathway to tailor their physicochemical properties for meeting a specific biomedical application. Herein, one methylene spacer between two amides in the side chain of N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) is introduced to generate a variant monomer, N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide (NAAA). Polymerization of NAAA in aqueous solution affords an unprecedented ultrasoft and highly swollen supramolecular polymer hydrogel due to weakened H&#8208;bonds caused by an extra methylene spacer, which is verified by variable&#8208;temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and simulation calculation. Intriguingly, poly(N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide) (PNAAA) hydrogel can be tuned to form a transient network with a self&#8208;fused and excellent antifouling capability that results from the weakened dual amide H&#8208;bonding interactions and enhanced water&#8208;amide H&#8208;bonding interactions. This self&#8208;fused PNAAA hydrogel can completely inhibit postoperative abdominal adhesion and recurrent adhesion after adhesiolysis in vivo. This transient hydrogel network allows for its disintegration and excretion from the body. The molecular mechanism studies reveal the signal pathway of PNAAA hydrogel in inhibiting inflammatory response and regulating fibrinolytic system balance. This self&#8208;fused, antifouling ultrasoft supramolecular hydrogel is promising as a barrier biomaterial for completely preventing postoperative tissue adhesion.
