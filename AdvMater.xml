         <title>Biomimetic Multi&#8208;Color Separating Photonic Skin Using Electrically Stretchable Chiral Photonic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Structural colors can be produced by nano&#8208;periodic dielectric structures using soft materials. Chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) produced from elastic chiral liquid crystal molecules can self&#8208;organize into a helical nanostructure, and the chiral nano&#8208;structural color can be tuned by stretching. However, the ability to control the separation of biomimetic multi&#8208;colors for practical applications beyond simple uniaxial stretching of single&#8208;colored structures has been limited until now. Here, stretchable CPEs with simultaneous multi&#8208;color control, including electrical control, are presented. By engineering the heterogeneous elastic modulus of the CPEs, stretchable and simultaneous multi&#8208;color separations from an initially homogeneous color are realized. Electrically stretchable multi&#8208;color separation is investigated using a hybrid CPE structure on dielectric elastomer actuators, and multi&#8208;arrayed color binning and chameleon&#8208;like photonic e&#8208;skin are further developed for device applications. Moreover, multi&#8208;color concealed camouflage switching and control of invisible photonic e&#8208;skin are demonstrated. This multi&#8208;color control of stretchable photonic systems improves the functionality of various potential photonic applications.

         <title>Atomically unraveling the structural evolution of surfaces and interfaces in metal halide perovskite quantum dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Revealing the local structural change of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) induced by external conditions is important to understand their performance and stability in optoelectronic applications. However, previous studies on the properties and structures of MHPs were usually limited by the spatial resolution of the probe, and it is still challenging to obtain their atomic structural information in real space. In this work, we apply the integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy to the low&#8208;dose imaging of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs). In particular, the local structures in QDs, such as surfaces and interfaces, can be atomically resolved. Then, the structural evolution of CsPbI3 QDs under various external conditions can be unraveled during in&#8208;situ heating or ex&#8208;situ treatments, where they will lose cubic shapes and fuse to larger particles. The changes in surfaces and interfaces with missing Cs ions and PbI6 octahedrons can be semi&#8208;quantitatively studied by profile analysis and bond&#8208;length measurement in images. Finally, the density functional theory calculations are performed to illustrate the properties and stabilities of the different structures that we observed. These results provide atomic&#8208;scale insights into the structural evolution of QDs, which is of great importance to modify the performance of perovskite materials and devices.

         <title>Asymmetrically Coordinated CoB1N3 Moieties for Selective Generation of High&#8208;Valence Co&#8208;Oxo Species via Coupled Electron&#8211;Proton Transfer in Fenton&#8208;like Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrically coordinated CoB1N3 offers an external electric field for the cleavage of O&#63743;H bond to boost the selective conversion of high&#8208;valence Co&#8208;Oxo species in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, upon which the rational design of tunable active sites at atomic level in triggering efficient Fenton&#8208;like reactions is expected.








Abstract
High&#8208;valence metal species generated in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes are promising candidates for selective degradation of contaminants in water, the formation of which necessitates the cleavage of O&#63743;H and O&#63743;O bonds as well as efficient electron transfer. However, the high dissociation energy of O&#63743;H bond makes its cleavage quite challenging, largely hampering the selective generation of reactive oxygen species. Herein, an asymmetrical configuration characterized by a single cobalt atom coordinated with boron and nitrogen (CoB1N3) is established to offer a strong local electric field, upon which the cleavage of O&#63743;H bond is thermodynamically favored via a promoted coupled electron&#8211;proton transfer process, which serves an essential step to further allow O&#63743;O bond cleavage and efficient electron transfer. Accordingly, the selective formation of Co(IV)&#63742;O in a single&#8208;atom Co/PMS system enables highly efficient removal performance toward various organic pollutants. The proposed strategy also holds true in other heteroatom doping systems to configure asymmetric coordination, thus paving alternative pathways for specific reactive species conversion by rationalized design of catalysts at atomic level toward environmental applications and more.

         <title>Artificial Lipid Biomembranes for Full&#8208;Length SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Receptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;free membrane protein synthesis system with natural lipid vesicle or nanodisc is constructed, which can effectively improve the membrane protein solubility and assist the active structure formation. In this system, the full&#8208;length SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor of 21 species is successfully synthesized, and differences in functional verification between the full&#8208;length and truncated versions suggest the importance of the transmembrane region.








Abstract
The angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), is essential for assessing potential hosts and treatments. However, many studies are based on its truncated version but not full&#8208;length structure. Indeed, a single transmembrane (TM) helix presents in the full&#8208;length ACE2, influencing its interaction with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Therefore, synthesis of the full&#8208;length ACE2 is an urgent requirement. Here, cell&#8208;free membrane protein synthesis systems (CFMPSs) are constructed for full&#8208;length membrane proteins. MscL is screened as a model among ten membrane proteins based on their expression and solubility. Next, CFMPSs are constructed and optimized based on natural vesicles, vesicles with four membrane proteins removed or two chaperonins added, and 37 types of nanodiscs. They all increase membrane protein solubility to over 50%. Finally, the full&#8208;length ACE2 of 21 species are successfully expressed with yields between 0.4 and 0.9&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. The definite functional differences from the truncated version suggest that the TM region affects ACE2's structure and function. CFMPSs can be extended to more membrane proteins, paving the way for further applications.

         <title>Reprogramming Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages by Nanoglycoclusters for Boosted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in hypoxic regions represent a promising target but are difficult for therapeutic intervention. A hypoxia&#8208;activated nanoglycocluster that orchestrates the size switch, affinity shift, and assembly efficiency change enables deep tumor penetration and efficient repolarization of hypoxic TAMs, facilitating the overall TAMs reprogramming effects. The tumor&#8208;penetrating nanoglycocluster can &#8220;warm&#8221; tumor immune microenvironment to inhibit tumor progression.








Abstract
The tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in intratumoral hypoxic regions are key drivers of immune escape. Reprogramming the hypoxic TAMs to antitumor phenotype holds great therapeutic benefits but remains challenging for current drugs. Here, an in situ activated nanoglycocluster is reported to realize effective tumor penetration and potent repolarization of hypoxic TAMs. Triggered by the hypoxia&#8208;upregulated matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2), the nanoglycocluster is self&#8208;assembled from the administered mannose&#8208;containing precursor glycopeptides and presents densely&#8208;arrayed mannoses to multivalently engage with mannose receptors on M2&#8208;like TAMs for efficient phenotype switch. By virtue of the high diffusivity of precursor glycopeptides due to their low molecular mass and weak affinity with TAMs in perivascular regions, the nanoglycoclusters are capable of substantially accumulating in hypoxic areas to strongly interact with local TAMs. This enables the efficient repolarization of overall TAMs with a higher rate than the small&#8208;molecule drug R848 and CD40 antibody, and beneficial therapeutic effects in mouse tumor models especially when combining with PD&#8208;1 antibody. This on&#8208;demand activated immunoagent is endowed with tumor&#8208;penetrating properties and inspires the design of diverse intelligent nanomedicines for hypoxia&#8208;related cancer immunotherapy.

By virtue of the high diffusivity of precursor glycopeptides due to their low molecular mass and weak affinity with TAMs in perivascular regions, the nanoglycoclusters are capable of substantially accumulating in hypoxic areas to strongly interact with local TAMs. This enables the efficient repolarization of overall TAMs with a higher rate than the small-molecule drug R848 and CD40 antibody, and beneficial therapeutic effects in mouse tumor models especially when combining with PD-1 antibody. This on-demand activated immunoagent is endowed with tumor-penetrating properties and inspires the design of diverse intelligent nanomedicines for hypoxia-related cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Bidirectional Optoelectronic Synapses based on 2D Molecular Crystal Heterojunctions for Motion Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bidirectional (excitatory and inhibitory) optoelectronic synapses are successfully prepared by using 2D molecular crystal heterojunctions. Superior contrast ratios (CR) of 1.53 &#215; 103 are demonstrated, transcending previous optoelectronic synapses, and the devices are applied for motion detection with an accuracy exceeding 90%.








Abstract
Light&#8208;stimulated optoelectronic synaptic devices are fundamental compositions of the neuromorphic vision system. However, there are still huge challenges to achieving both bidirectional synaptic behaviors under light stimuli and high performance. Herein, a bilayer 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) p&#8208;n heterojunction is developed to achieve high&#8208;performance bidirectional synaptic behaviors. The 2DMC heterojunction&#8208;based field effect transistor (FET) devices exhibit typical ambipolar properties and remarkable responsivity (R) of 3.58&#215;104 A W&#8722;1 under weak light as low as 0.008&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic behaviors are successfully realized by the same light stimuli under different gate voltages. Moreover, a superior contrast ratio (CR) of 1.53&#215;103 is demonstrated by the ultrathin and high&#8208;quality 2DMC heterojunction, which transcends previous optoelectronic synapses and enables application for the motion detection of the pendulum. Furthermore, a motion detection network based on the device is developed to detect and recognize classic motion vehicles in road traffic with an accuracy exceeding 90%. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;contrast bidirectional optoelectronic synapses and shows great potential in the intelligent bionic device and future artificial vision.

         <title>Poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;block&#8208;PM6 Polymer Donors for High&#8208;Performance and Mechanically Robust Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with high&#8208;performance and &#8208;stretchability are developed by designing block copolymer donors comprising PM6 and elastomeric PDMS blocks (PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS). High power conversion efficiency (PCE &#8776; 18%) and stretchability (crack onset point &gt; 18%) are demonstrated for the PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k&#8208;based PSC. The PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k&#8208;based intrinsically stretchable PSCs show superior mechanical stability (PCE retention &gt; 80% at 32% strain) than the PM6&#8208;based and PM6:PDMS&#8208;blend&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stretchability are the dual requirements for the wearable application of polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, most efficient photoactive films are mechanically brittle. In this work, highly efficient (PCE = 18%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) = 18%) PSCs are acheived by designing block copolymer (BCP) donors, PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMSx (x = 5k, 12k, and 19k). In these BCP donors, stretchable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) blocks are covalently linked with the PM6 blocks to effectively increase the stretchability. The stretchability of the BCP donors increases with a longer PDMS block, and PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k:L8&#8208;BO PSC exhibits a high PCE (18%) and 9&#8208;times higher COS value (18%) compared to that (COS = 2%) of the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based PSC. However, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:PDMS12k ternary blend shows inferior PCE (5%) and COS (1%) due to the macrophase separation between PDMS and active components. In the intrinsically stretchable PSC, the PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k:L8&#8208;BO blend exhibits significantly greater mechanical stability PCE80% ((80% of the initial PCE) at 36% strain) than those of the PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend (PCE80% at 12% strain) and the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:PDMS ternary blend (PCE80% at 4% strain). This study suggests an effective design strategy of BCP PD to achieve stretchable and efficient PSCs.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces and atomically thin layers have been shown to be capable of being incorporated into flexible electronic devices. The electronic and optical properties of 2D materials can be tuned or controlled in other ways by using the intriguing strain engineering method. We condensed the latest and encouraging techniques in regards to creating flexible 2D nanoelectronics in this review article. These techniques have the potential to be used in a wider range of applications in the near and long term. It is possible to use ultrathin 2D materials 2D materials (graphene, BP, WTe2, VSe2 etc.) and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) in order to enable the electrical behavior of the devices to be studied. A category of materials was produced on smaller scales by exfoliating bulk materials, whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and epitaxial growth were employed on larger scales. The overview of our review paper highlights two distinct requirements, which include from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures of various nanomaterials. They include where strain must be avoided, such as solutions in order to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and they include where strain is required, such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes. Stretchable nanoelectronics' use in e&#8208;skin as well as a comparison of the features and functionality of 2D flexible electronic devices are all discussed as methods in order to impart stretchability in addition to material and structural engineering. Finally, the points&#8208;of&#8208;view about the current difficulties and possibilities in regards to using 2D materials in flexible electronics are provided.

         <title>Carbonization Temperature Dependent Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanofibers &#8208; from Nanoscale to Macroscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An exact understanding of the conductivity of individual fibers and their networks is crucial to tailor the overall macroscopic properties of polyacrylonitril (PAN) based carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Therefore, microelectrical properties of CNF networks and nanoelectrical properties of individual CNFs, carbonized at temperatures from 600&#176;C to 1000&#176;C, are studied by means of conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM). At the microscale, the CNF networks show good electrical interconnections enabling a homogeneously distributed current flow. The network's homogeneity is underlined by the strong correlation of macroscopic conductivities, determined by the four&#8208;point&#8208;method, and microscopic results. Both, microscopic and macroscopic electrical properties, solely depend on the carbonization temperature and the exact resulting fiber structure. Strikingly, nanoscale high resolution current maps of individual CNFs reveal a large high&#8208;resistive surface fraction, representing a clear limitation. High&#8208;resistive surface domains are either attributed to disordered high&#8208;resistive carbon structures at the surface or the absence of electron percolation paths in the bulk volume. With increased carbonization temperature, the conductive surface domains grow in size resulting in a higher conductivity. This work contributes to existing microstructural models of CNFs by extending them by electrical properties, especially electron percolation&#160;paths.

Thermal conductivity modulation in PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals is demonstrated with a maximum enhancement of more than 20% at the intermediate poling state (intermediate d33). The enhancement is attributed to the reduction in domain wall density due to alternating current poling. The thermal conductivity decreases at optimized poling (maximum d33) due to increasing domain size inhomogeneity.








Abstract
Acting like thermal resistances, ferroelectric domain walls can be manipulated to realize dynamic modulation of thermal conductivity (k), which is essential for developing novel phononic circuits. Despite the interest, little attention has been paid to achieving room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in bulk materials due to challenges in obtaining a high thermal conductivity switching ratio (khigh/klow), particularly in commercially viable materials. Here, room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in 2.5&#160;mm&#8208;thick Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;xPbTiO3 (PMN&#8211;xPT) single crystals is demonstrated. With the use of advanced poling conditions, assisted by the systematic study on composition and orientation dependence of PMN&#8211;xPT, a range of thermal conductivity switching ratios with a maximum of &#8776;1.27 is observed. Simultaneous measurements of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) to characterize the poling state, domain wall density using polarized light microscopy (PLM), and birefringence change using quantitative PLM&#160;reveal that compared to the unpoled state, the domain wall density at intermediate poling states (0&lt; d33&lt;d33,max) is lower due to the enlargement in domain size. At optimized poling conditions (d33,max), the domain sizes show increased inhomogeneity that leads to enhancement in the domain wall density. This work highlights the potential of commercially available PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals among other relaxor&#8208;ferroelectrics for achieving temperature control in solid&#8208;state devices.

         <title>Drycells: Cell&#8208;suspension micro liquid marbles for single&#8208;cell picking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cell&#8208;picking technology is essential for cell culturing. Although the recently developed tools enable single&#8208;cell&#8208;level with a &gt;95% aqueous culture medium, thereby acting as a powerful cell&#8208;picking tool, is reported. The proposed &#8220;drycells&#8221; are formed by spraying a cell suspension onto a powder bed of hydrophobic fumed silica nanoparticles. The particles adsorb to the droplet surface and form a superhydrophobic shell, which prevents the drycells from coalescence. The number of encapsulated cells per drycell can be controlled by adjusting the drycell size and cell&#8208;suspension concentration. Moreover, it is possible to encapsulate a pair of normal or cancerous cells and create several cell colonies within a single drycell. A sieving process can be used to sort the drycells according to size. The size of the droplet can range from one to hundreds of micrometers. The drycells are sufficiently stiff to be collected using a tweezer; however, centrifugation separates them into nanoparticles and cell&#8208;suspension layers, with the separated particles being recyclable. Various handling techniques, such as splitting coalescence and inner liquid replacement, can be used. We believe that the application of the proposed drycells will greatly improve the accessibility and productivity of single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Unraveling Thermal Transport Correlated with Atomistic Structures in Amorphous Gallium Oxide via Machine Learning Combined with Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based models and experimental observations leads to a deep understanding of atomistic structures, thermal transport properties, and structure&#8211;thermal property correlations for disordered materials. A physics&#8208;inspired structural descriptor, namely the structural similarity factor, is proposed for disordered phases, with which the underlying relationship between structures and thermal conductivities is predicted in a linear form.








Abstract
Thermal transport properties of amorphous materials are crucial for their emerging applications in energy and electronic devices. However, understanding and controlling thermal transport in disordered materials remains an outstanding challenge, owing to the intrinsic limitations of computational techniques and the lack of physically intuitive descriptors for complex atomistic structures. Here, it is shown how combining machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based models and experimental observations can help to accurately describe realistic structures, thermal transport properties, and structure&#8211;property maps for disordered materials, which is illustrated by a practical application on gallium oxide. First, the experimental evidence is reported to demonstrate that machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials, generated in a self&#8208;guided fashion with minimum quantum&#8208;mechanical computations, enable the accurate modeling of amorphous gallium oxide and its thermal transport properties. The atomistic simulations then reveal the microscopic changes in the short&#8208;range and medium&#8208;range order with density and elucidate how these changes can reduce localization modes and enhance coherences&#8217; contribution to heat transport. Finally, a physics&#8208;inspired structural descriptor for disordered phases is proposed, with which the underlying relationship between structures and thermal conductivities is predicted in a linear form. This work may shed light on the future accelerated exploration of thermal transport properties and mechanisms in disordered functional materials.

         <title>Emergent Ferroelectric Switching Behavior from Polar Vortex Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the polar vortex lattice, low&#8208;field metastable switching events are demonstrated in coexistence with classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability. By changing the poled state of the vortex lattice one can tune the anisotropy of these low&#8208;field hysteresis loops, allowing for a novel method of non&#8208;destructive readout of the poled state with a simple in&#8208;plane capacitor.








Abstract
Topologically protected polar textures have provided a rich playground for the exploration of novel, emergent phenomena. Recent discoveries indicate that ferroelectric vortices and skyrmions not only host properties markedly different from traditional ferroelectrics, but also that these properties can be harnessed for unique memory devices. Using a combination of capacitor&#8208;based capacitance measurements and computational models, it is demonstrated that polar vortices in dielectric&#8211;ferroelectric&#8211;dielectric trilayers exhibit classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability together with the existence of low&#8208;field metastable polarization states. This behavior is directly tied to the in&#8208;plane vortex ordering, and it is shown that it can be used as a new method of non&#8208;destructive readout&#8208;out of the poled state.

         <title>Atomic Displacements Enabling the Observation of the Anomalous Hall Effect in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows that in thin films of some non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets the magnetic atoms can be displaced away from high&#8208;symmetry positions. The resulting spin canting allows for control of domain structure. In Mn3SnN this allows for the observation of an unusual temperature&#8208;dependent anomalous Hall effect that indicates the presence of a coherent spin&#8208;rotational non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnetic phase.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with non&#8208;collinear spin structures display various properties that make them attractive for spintronic devices. Some of the most interesting examples are an anomalous Hall effect despite negligible magnetization and a spin Hall effect with unusual spin polarization directions. However, these effects can only be observed when the sample is set predominantly into a single antiferromagnetic domain state. This can only be achieved when the compensated spin structure is perturbed and displays weak moments due to spin canting that allows for external domain control. In thin films of cubic non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets, this imbalance is previously assumed to require tetragonal distortions induced by substrate strain. Here, it is shown that in Mn3SnN and Mn3GaN, spin canting is due to structural symmetry lowering induced by large displacements of the magnetic manganese atoms away from high&#8208;symmetry positions. These displacements remain hidden in X&#8208;ray diffraction when only probing the lattice metric and require measurement of a large set of scattering vectors to resolve the local atomic positions. In Mn3SnN, the induced net moments enable the observation of the anomalous Hall effect with an unusual temperature dependence, which is conjectured to result from a bulk&#8208;like temperature&#8208;dependent coherent spin rotation within the kagome&#160;plane.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Recruitment of Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Precise Tumor Vascular Disruption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel VDA&#8208;free biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNP) that consists of a photothermal semiconducting polymer agent camouflaged with a platelet membrane is developed. SPNP exhibits a photothermally controlled recruitment behavior that augments targeting and accumulation of SPNP specifically around injured tumor vessels, achieving precise tumor vascular disruption, inhibition of splenomegaly, and reversion of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through two&#8208;stage light manipulation.








Abstract
Tumor vascular disrupting therapy has offered promising opportunities to treat cancer in clinical practice, whereas the overall therapeutic efficacy is notably limited due to the off&#8208;target effects and repeated dose toxicity of vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). To tackle this problem, a VDA&#8208;free biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNP) is herein reported for precise tumor vascular disruption through two&#8208;stage light manipulation. SPNP consists of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle as the photothermal agent camouflaged with platelet membranes that specifically target disrupted vasculature. Upon the first photoirradiation, SPNP administered in vivo generates mild hyperthermia to trigger tumor vascular hemorrhage, which activates the coagulation cascade and recruits more SPNP to injured blood vessels. Such enhanced tumor vascular targeting of photothermal agents enables intense hyperthermia to destroy the tumor vasculature during the second photoirradiation, leading to complete tumor eradication and efficient metastasis inhibition. Intriguingly, the mechanism study reveals that this vascular disruption strategy alleviates splenomegaly and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells. Therefore, this study not only illustrates a light&#8208;driven self&#8208;recruitment strategy to enhance tumor vascular disruption via a single dose of biomimetic therapeutics but also deciphers the immunotherapeutic role of vascular disruption therapy that is conducive to clinical studies.

         <title>Polymeric Memristor Based Artificial Synapses with Ultra&#8208;Wide Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic polymeric memristive device using MDMO&#8208;PPV is demonstrated. The unencapsulated devices maintain reliable memristive switching behavior under an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (77&#8211;573 K). XPS and ToF&#8208;SIMS depth profiling techniques are utilized to visualize the kinetic process of ion migration in the device. This work may allow the use of organic memristors as robust artificial synapses in ultra&#8208;wide temperature range for future neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Neuromorphic electronics, being inspired by how the brain works, hold great promise to the successful implementation of smart artificial systems. Among several neuromorphic hardware issues, a robust device functionality under extreme temperature is of particular importance for practical applications. Given that the organic memristors for artificial synapse applications are demonstrated under room temperature, achieving a robust device performance at extremely low or high temperature is still utterly challenging. In this work, the temperature issue is addressed by tuning the functionality of the solution&#8208;based organic polymeric memristor. The optimized memristor demonstrates a reliable performance under both the cryogenic and high&#8208;temperature environments. The unencapsulated organic polymeric memristor shows a robust memristive response under test temperature ranging from 77 to 573&#160;K. Utilizing X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) depth profiling, the device working mechanism is unveiled by comparing the compositional profiles of the fresh and written organic polymeric memristors. A reversible ion migration induced by an applied voltage contributes to the characteristic switching behavior of the memristor. Herein, both the robust memristive response achieved at extreme temperatures and the verified device working mechanism will remarkably accelerate the development of memristors in neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Generation of 13.9&#8208;mJ Terahertz Radiation from Lithium Niobate Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme terahertz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to terahertz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength&#160;was&#160;estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Extremely strong&#8208;field terahertz (THz) radiation in free space has compelling applications in nonequilibrium condensed matter state regulation, all&#8208;optical THz electron acceleration and manipulation, THz biological effects, etc. However, these practical applications are constrained by the absence of high&#8208;intensity, high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;beam&#8208;quality, and stable solid&#8208;state THz light sources. Here, the generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme THz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and a 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to THz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse&#8208;front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength is estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1. A record of 1.1&#8208;mJ THz single&#8208;pulse energy at a 450 mJ pump at room temperature is produced and observed that the self&#8208;phase modulation of the optical pump can induce THz saturation behavior from the crystals in the substantially nonlinear pump regime. This study lays the foundation for the generation of sub&#8208;Joule THz radiation from lithium niobate crystals and will inspire more innovations in extreme THz science and applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;architectured high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading proton pseudocapacitors with cross&#8208;scale, high energy density, and oriented toward harsh environments are rationally designed via 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitors can deliver a high energy density of 0.514 mWh cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability at the ultralow temperature of &#8722;60&#176;C.








Abstract
The sluggish ionic transport in thick electrodes and freezing electrolytes has limited electrochemical energy storage devices in lots of harsh environments for practical applications. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed proton pseudocapacitor based on high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading 3D&#8208;printed WO3 anodes, Prussian blue analog cathodes, and anti&#8208;freezing electrolytes is developed, which can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance at low temperatures. Benefiting from the cross&#8208;scale 3D electrode structure using a 3D printing direct ink writing technique, the 3D&#8208;printed cathode realizes an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.39&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a high areal mass loading of 23.51&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 3.44 F&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent areal energy density (1.08 mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2). Owing to the fast ion kinetics in 3D electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of the hybrid electrolyte, the 3D&#8208;printed supercapacitor delivers 61.3% of the room&#8208;temperature capacitance even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical applications of energy storage devices with complex physical structure at extreme temperatures.

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Strategy to Reverse NK Cell Exhaustion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cetuximab can target EGFR, and then induce the decrease of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) content, accompanied by the inhibition of MTHFD2 activity by LY345899, leading to the boosting of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The generated ROS can oxidize C5SeSeC5 into seleninic acid, which can inhibit the expression of human leukocyte antigen E, further reverse the exhaustion of natural killer cells in conjunction with the antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity effect mediated by cetuximab.








Abstract
As a specialized immune effector cell, natural killer (NK) cells play a very important role in immunotherapy, but tumor immunosuppression caused by abnormal expression of cancer cells seriously weakens its therapeutic effect and leads to exhaustion. Here, self&#8208;assembled selenium&#8208;containing nanoparticles (NPs) composed of cetuximab, C5SeSeC5, and inhibitor LY345899 are developed to reverse NK cell exhaustion. The obtained NPs can target epidermal growth factor receptor on the surface of cancer cells and locate it in mitochondria. The released LY345899 can inhibit the activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 and produce excessive reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation of seleninic acid, further reducing the expression of human leukocyte antigen E , which is responsible for the NKG2A&#8208;related NK cell inhibition. As a result, the enhanced NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy in conjunction with the cetuximab&#8208;mediated antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity effect can not only effectively inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors, but also significantly suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect.

&lt;p&gt;Cetuximab can target EGFR, and then induce the decrease of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) content, accompanied by the inhibition of MTHFD2 activity by LY345899, leading to the boosting of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The generated ROS can oxidize C5SeSeC5 into seleninic acid, which can inhibit the expression of human leukocyte antigen E, further reverse the exhaustion of natural killer cells in conjunction with the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity effect mediated by cetuximab.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a specialized immune effector cell, natural killer (NK) cells play a very important role in immunotherapy, but tumor immunosuppression caused by abnormal expression of cancer cells seriously weakens its therapeutic effect and leads to exhaustion. Here, self-assembled selenium-containing nanoparticles (NPs) composed of cetuximab, C5SeSeC5, and inhibitor LY345899 are developed to reverse NK cell exhaustion. The obtained NPs can target epidermal growth factor receptor on the surface of cancer cells and locate it in mitochondria. The released LY345899 can inhibit the activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 and produce excessive reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation of seleninic acid, further reducing the expression of human leukocyte antigen E , which is responsible for the NKG2A-related NK cell inhibition. As a result, the enhanced NK-cell-mediated immunotherapy in conjunction with the cetuximab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity effect can not only effectively inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors, but also significantly suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect. This work, the combination of seleninic acid, LY345899, and cetuximab, provides a new strategy for reversing NK cell exhaustion and has great potential for use in the treatment of metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Stable Lead&#8208;Free Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells: Lessons from Materials Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most widely used lead&#8208;free perovskites are based on tin, however shortcomings in their stability prevent further developments of this technology. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art avenues to overcome these shortcomings include composition engineering, additive engineering, and interface engineering. This review reveals a set of design rules for the development of stable tin&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells by collectively analyzing a decade of materials chemistry.








Abstract
Substituting toxic lead with tin (Sn) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the most promising route toward the development of high&#8208;efficiency lead&#8208;free devices. Despite the encouraging efficiencies of Sn&#8208;PSCs, they are still yet to surpass 15% and suffer detrimental oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV). Since their first application in 2014, investigations into the properties of Sn&#8208;PSCs have contributed to a growing understanding of the mechanisms, both detrimental and complementary to their stability. This review summarizes the evolution of Sn&#8208;PSCs, including early developments to the latest state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches benefitting the stability of devices. The degradation pathways associated with Sn&#8208;PSCs are first outlined, followed by describing how composition engineering (A, B site modifications), additive engineering (oxidation prevention), and interface engineering (passivation strategies) can be employed as different avenues to improve the stability of devices. The knowledge about these properties is also not limited to PSCs and also applicable to other types of devices now employing Sn&#8208;based perovskite absorber layers. A detailed analysis of the properties and materials chemistry reveals a clear set of design rules for the development of stable Sn&#8208;PSCs. Applying the design strategies highlighted in this review will be essential to further improve both the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Strategies to Extend the Lifetime of Perovskite Downconversion Films for Display Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to increase the structural stability of perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) are reviewed. The standard conditions to test the reliability of PeNCs downconversion films are also listed and recent progress on the stability improvement of PeNCs for downconversion displays is discussed, their current commercialization status is presented, and future PeNC research is suggested.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) have outstanding luminescent properties that are suitable for displays that have high color purity and high absorption coefficient; so they are evaluated for application as light emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, light&#8208;converters for downconversion displays, and future near&#8208;eye augmented reality/virtual reality displays. However, PeNCs are chemically vulnerable to heat, light, and moisture, and these weaknesses must be overcome before devices that use PeNCs can be commercialized. This review examines strategies to overcome the low stability of PeNCs and thereby permit the fabrication of stable downconversion films, and summarizes downconversion&#8208;type display applications and future prospects. First, methods to increase the chemical stability of PeNCs are examined. Second, methods to encapsulate PeNC downconversion films to increase their lifetime are reviewed. Third, methods to increase the long&#8208;term compatibility of resin with PeNCs, and finally, how to secure stability using fillers added to the resin are summarized. Fourth, the method to manufacture downconversion films and the procedure to evaluate their reliability for commercialization is then described. Finally, the prospects of a downconversion system that exploits the properties of PeNCs and can be employed to fabricate fine pixels for high&#8208;resolution displays and for near&#8208;eye augmented reality/virtual reality devices are explored.

         <title>Coacervation&#8208;Mediated Cytocompatible Formation of Supramolecular Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Evolving Macropores for 3D Multicellular Spheroid Culture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a new synthetic strategy to engineer macroporous hydrogels (MPH) via the coacervation process of supramolecular assemblies crosslinked by host&#8211;guest complexation between &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anthracene dimer. The excellent structural dynamics and the cytocompatible void&#8208;forming process of MPH can better accommodate the dramatic volumetric expansion associated with the colony growth of encapsulated cells, thereby facilitating their cellular functions.








Abstract
Coacervation driven liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of biopolymers has aroused considerable attention for diverse applications, especially for the construction of microstructured polymeric materials. Herein, a coacervate&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogel transition strategy is developed to create macroporous hydrogels (MPH), which&#160;are formed via the coacervation process of supramolecular assemblies (SA) built by the host&#8211;guest complexation between &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anthracene dimer. The weak and reversible supramolecular crosslinks endow the SA with liquid&#8208;like rheological properties, which facilitate the formation of SA&#8208;derived macroporous coacervates and the subsequent transition to MPH (pore size &#8776; 100&#160;&#181;m). The excellent structural dynamics (derived from SA) and the cytocompatible void&#8208;forming process of MPH can better accommodate the dramatic volumetric expansion associated with colony growth of encapsulated multicellular spheroids compared with the non&#8208;porous static hydrogel with similar initial mechanical properties. The findings of this work not only provide valuable guidance to the design of biomaterials with self&#8208;evolving structures but also present a promising strategy for 3D multicellular spheroid culture and other diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Tailoring the Plasticity of Topologically Close&#8208;Packed Phases via the Crystals&#8217; Fundamental Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to understand and tailor the deformability of brittle topologically close&#8208;packed precipitates in advanced alloys using the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase as a model material is presented. The plasticity of the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase is controlled by the Laves phase building block in its unit cell, leading to changes in hardness and stiffness, as well as a shift in the slip mechanism. The results provide opportunities for tailoring the plasticity of these phases by manipulating the interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the crystal building blocks in their unit cells.








Abstract
Brittle topologically close&#8208;packed precipitates form in many advanced alloys. Due to their complex structures, little is known about their plasticity. Here, a strategy is presented to understand and tailor the deformability of these complex phases by considering the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase as an archetypal material. The plasticity of the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase is controlled by the Laves phase building block that forms parts of its unit cell. It is found that between the bulk C15&#8211;NbCo2 Laves and Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phases, the interplanar spacing and local stiffness of the Laves phase building block change, leading to a strong reduction in hardness and stiffness, as well as a transition from synchroshear to crystallographic slip. Furthermore, as the composition changes from Nb6Co7 to Nb7Co6, the Co atoms in the triple layer are substituted such that the triple layer of the Laves phase building block becomes a slab of pure Nb, resulting in inhomogeneous changes in elasticity and a transition from crystallographic slip to a glide&#8208;and&#8208;shuffle mechanism. These findings open opportunities to purposefully tailor the plasticity of these topologically close&#8208;packed phases in the bulk by manipulating the interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the fundamental crystal building blocks at the atomic scale.

High&#8208;quality, centimeter&#8208;sized LiInP2Se6 single crystals are successfully grown by the Bridgman method for the first time. The detailed and comprehensive crystal growth behaviors, microstructure features, electrical, and &#945;&#8208;particle/&#947;&#8208;ray/thermal neutron detection properties, defect mechanisms as well as radiation resistance are studied using a range of experimental and computational methods.








Abstract
Direct neutron detection based on semiconductor crystals holds promise to transform current neutron detector technologies and further boosts their widespread applications. It is, however, long impeded by the dearth of suitable materials in the form of sizeable bulk crystals. Here, high&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;sized LiInP2Se6 single crystals are developed using the Bridgman method and their structure and property characteristics are systematically investigated. The prototype detectors fabricated from the crystals demonstrate an energy resolution of 53.7% in response to &#945;&#8208;particles generated from an 241Am source and robust, well&#8208;defined response spectra to thermal neutrons that exhibit no polarization or degradation effects under prolonged neutron/&#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The primary mechanisms of Se&#8208;vacancy and InLi antisite defects in the carrier trapping process are also identified. Such insights are critical for further enhancing the energy resolution of LiInP2Se6 bulk crystals toward the intrinsic level (&#8776;8.6% as indicated by the chemical vapor transport&#8208;grown thin crystals). These results pave the way for practically adopting LiInP2Se6 single crystals in new&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state neutron detectors.

         <title>Preventing Vanishing Gradient Problem of Hardware Neuromorphic System by Implementing Imidazole&#8208;Based Memristive ReLU Activation Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly compact and energy&#8208;efficient rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation neuron is demonstrated using a 2T1R structure with a hybrid memristor using a copolymer/inorganic bilayer to emulate volatile and gradual conductance modulation. It is confirmed that memristor&#8208;based ReLU (mReLU) can effectively reduce the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. Furthermore, an mReLU&#8208;based fully analog neuromorphic system is proposed.








Abstract
With advances in artificial intelligent services, brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic systems with synaptic devices are recently attracting significant interest to circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck. However, the increasing trend of deep neural network parameters causes huge power consumption and large area overhead of a nonlinear neuron electronic circuit, and it incurs a vanishing gradient problem. Here, a memristor&#8208;based compact and energy&#8208;efficient neuron device is presented to implement a rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation function. To emulate the volatile and gradual switching of the ReLU function, a copolymer memristor with a hybrid structure is proposed using a copolymer/inorganic bilayer. The functional copolymer film developed by introducing imidazole functional groups enables the formation of nanocluster&#8208;type pseudo&#8208;conductive filaments by boosting the nucleation of Cu nanoclusters, causing gradual switching. The ReLU neuron device is successfully demonstrated by integrating the memristor with amorphous InGaZnO thin&#8208;film transistors, and achieves 0.5&#160;pJ of energy consumption based on sub&#8208;10&#160;&#181;A operation current and high&#8208;speed switching of 650&#160;ns. Furthermore, device&#8208;to&#8208;system&#8208;level simulation using neuron devices on the MNIST dataset demonstrates that the vanishing gradient problem is effectively resolved by five&#8208;layer deep neural networks. The proposed neuron device will enable the implementation of high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient hardware neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Ultrahigh Performance, Serially Stackable, Breeze Driven Triboelectric Generator via Ambient Air Ionizing Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated charge&#8208;polarization&#8208;based flutter&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator (CPF&#8208;TENG) that can generate high electrical output by utilizing ambient air ionizing channel (AAIC) is fabricated. Even with low velocity wind input, CPF&#8208;TENG with AAIC can generate high electrical output so the stacked device can completely harvest unidirectional wind energy. Consequently, the device can turn on several electronics and produce 342.3&#160;&#181;L&#160;h&#8722;1 of hydrogen.








Abstract
Currently, wind energy harvesting is in the limelight. However, with the existing electromagnetic wind generators, it is difficult to harvest multifariously&#8208;wasted breezes. To harvest energy from winds at a wide range of speeds, wind&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are studied. However, a critical limitation of general wind&#8208;driven TENGs is that their power output is low. Therefore, an innovative strategy is necessary to generate high output power even from breeze. Herein, an approach to test a charge&#8208;polarization&#8208;based flutter&#8208;driven TENG (CPF&#8208;TENG) with ambient air ionizing channel (AAIC) is reported. Owing to AAIC, the device generates peak voltage and current outputs of 2000&#160;V and 4&#160;A, respectively. Moreover, because the proposed CPF&#8208;TENG can generate power from breeze, it can be stacked in series to completely harvest wind energy. The stacked CPF&#8208;TENG is demonstrated to operate 3000 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and 12 hygrometers, separately, and produce hydrogen at a rate of 342.3&#160;&#181;L&#160;h&#8722;1 with the electrolysis cell.

         <title>Amorphous Copper&#8208;Based Nanoparticles with Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Phosphorescence for Ultrasensing 2,4,6&#8208;Trinitrotoluene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel amorphous copper&#8208;based nanoparticles with ideal microstructure and abundant recongition sites, that are able to facilitate the electron transfer, are designed&#160;and prepared for phosphorescence&#8208;off detection of airborne 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene microparticulates with excellent specificity, instantaneous response time, and ultralow detection limit, which not only deepens the insights of photochemistry but also stretches metal&#8208;based nanostructures to new limits.








Abstract
Amorphous metal&#8208;based nanostructures have attracted great attention recently due to their facilitative electron transfer and abundant reactive sites, whereas it remains enigmatic as to whether amorphous copper&#8208;based nanoparticles (CuNPs) can be achieved. Here, for synthesizing amorphous CuNPs, glutathione is adopted as a ligand to inhibit the nucleation and crystallization process via its electrostatic repulsion. By subtly tailoring the solvent polarity, not only can amorphous glutathione&#8208;functionalized CuNPs (GSH&#8208;CuNPs) with phosphorescent performance be achieved after transferring the non&#8208;conjugation of GSH ligand to through&#8208;space conjugation, namely clusterization&#8208;triggered emission, but also the phosphorescence&#8208;off of GSH&#8208;CuNPs toward 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT) can be realized by the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer process through the hydrogen bond channel, which is established between carboxyl and amino groups of GSH&#8208;CuNPs with the nitryl group of TNT. Benefitting from the intrinsic superiorities of the amorphous CuNPs, desired phosphorescence and detection performances of GSH&#8208;CuNPs toward airborne TNT microparticulates are undoubtedly realized, including high quantum yield (13.22%), excellent specificity in 33 potential interferents, instantaneous response, and ultralow detection limit (1.56 pg). The present GSH&#8208;CuNPs are expected to stretch amorphous metal&#8208;based nanostructures and deepen the insights into amorphous materials for optical detection.

         <title>Bridging Synthesis and Controllable Doping of Monolayer 4 in. Length Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides Single Crystals with High Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;assisted epitaxial strategy to synthesize 4 in. length transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on c&#8208;plane sapphire is designed, ultrahigh mobility and remarkable on/off current ratio are discovered due to the ultralow contact resistance. The introduction of Fe decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment of TMDCs domains.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth and controllable doping of wafer&#8208;scale atomically thin semiconductor single crystals are two central tasks to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Despite considerable efforts are devoted, addressing such crucial issues simultaneously under 2D confinement is yet to be realized. Here, an ingenious strategy to synthesize record&#8208;breaking 4 in. length Fe&#8208;doped transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on industry&#8208;compatible c&#8208;plane sapphire without special miscut angle is designed. Atomically thin transistors with high electron mobility (&#8776;146 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and remarkable on/off current ratio (&#8776;109) are fabricated based on 4 in. length Fe&#8208;MoS2 single crystals, due to the ultralow contact resistance (&#8776;489 &#937; &#181;m). In&#8208;depth characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Fe significantly decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment TMDCs domains (&gt;99%). This work represents a substantial leap in terms of bridging synthesis and doping of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.

Atomically thin transistors with high electron mobility (&#8776;146 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and remarkable on/off current ratio (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) are fabricated based on 4 in. length Fe-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals, due to the ultralow contact resistance (&#8776;489 &#937; &#181;m). In-depth characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Fe significantly decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge-nucleation of unidirectional alignment TMDCs domains (&amp;gt;99%). This work represents a substantial leap in terms of bridging synthesis and doping of wafer-scale 2D semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Large&#8208;Sized Yttrium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
d&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient elements like Y, typically Fenton&#8208;inactive, are activated into a Pt&#8208;like oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst through dynamic coordinative regulation. The experimental results validate that the as&#8208;designed YN4&#8208;Cl catalyst has good ORR activity and durability, rivalling the commercial Pt/C counterparts. This work provides a reliable and universal strategy for the design of d&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient single&#8208;atom catalysts with Pt&#8208;like ORR activity and Fenton&#8208;inactive character.








Abstract
Although being transition metals, the Fenton&#8208;inactive group 3&#8211;4 elements (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, and Hf) can easily lose all the outermost s and d electrons, leaving behind ionic sites with nearly empty outermost orbitals that are stable but inactive for oxygen involved catalysis. Here, it is demonstrated that the dynamic coordination network can turn these commonly inactive ionic sites into platinum&#8208;like catalytic centers for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Using density functional theory calculations, a macrocyclic ligand coordinated yttrium single&#8208;atom (YN4) moiety is identified, which is originally ORR inactive because of the too strong binding of hydroxyl intermediate, while it can be activated by an axial ligand X through the covalency competition between Y&#63743;X and Y&#63743;OH bonds. Strikingly, it is also found that the binding force of the axially coordinated ligand is an effective descriptor, and the chlorine ligand is screened out with an optimal binding force that behaves self&#8208;adaptively to facilitate each ORR intermediate steps by dynamically changing its Y&#63743;Cl covalency. These experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed YN4&#8208;Cl moieties embedded within the carbon framework exhibit a high half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.85&#160;V) in alkaline media, the same as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst .

         <title>A Nitroxide Radical Conjugated Polymer as an Additive to Reduce Nonradiative Energy Loss in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitroxide radical side chain substituted conjugated polymer, GDTA, employed as a solid additive to generally boost the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells from a broad range of photovoltaic material systems, especially for the nonfullerene acceptor&#8208;based cells, is reported.








Abstract
Nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells (NFA&#8208;OSCs) are now set off to the 20% power conversion efficiency milestone. To achieve this, minimizing all loss channels, including nonradiative photovoltage losses, seems a necessity. Nonradiative recombination, to a great extent, is known to be an inherent material property due to vibrationally induced decay of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states or their back electron transfer to the triplet excitons. Herein, it is shown that the use of a new conjugated nitroxide radical polymer with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl piperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl side groups (GDTA) as an additive results in an improvement of the photovoltaic performance of NFA&#8208;OSCs based on different active layer materials. Upon the addition of GDTA, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) improve simultaneously. This approach is applied to several material systems including state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art donor/acceptor pairs showing improvement from 15.8% to 17.6% (in the case of PM6:Y6) and from 17.5% to 18.3% (for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9). Then, the possible reasons behind the observed improvements are discussed. The results point toward the suppression of the CT state to triplet excitons loss channel. This work presents a facile, promising, and generic approach to further improve the performance of NFA&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Inspired Bacterial Cellulose/Mica Nanopaper with Excellent Mechanical and Electrical Insulating Properties by Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nacre&#8208;inspired nanopaper is fabricated through an aerosol&#8208;assisted biosynthesis (AABS) strategy. Based on the AABS strategy and biomimetic structure design, the nanopaper has excellent mechanical properties, high dielectric strength, and ultralong corona resistance time. The dielectric&#8208;mechanical comprehensive performance of the nanopaper is far beyond that of various commercial mica papers.








Abstract
The exploration of extreme environments has become necessary for understanding and changing nature. However, the development of functional materials suitable for extreme conditions is still insufficient. Herein, a kind of nacre&#8208;inspired bacterial cellulose (BC)/synthetic mica (S&#8208;Mica) nanopaper with excellent mechanical and electrical insulating properties that has excellent tolerance to extreme conditions is reported. Benefited from the nacre&#8208;inspired structure and the 3D network of BC, the nanopaper exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including high tensile strength (375&#160;MPa), outstanding foldability, and bending fatigue resistance. In addition, S&#8208;Mica arranged in layers endows the nanopaper with remarkable dielectric strength (145.7 kV&#160;mm&#8722;1) and ultralong corona resistance life. Moreover, the nanopaper is highly resistant to alternating high and low temperatures, UV light, and atomic oxygen, making it an ideal candidate for extreme environment&#8208;resistant materials.

         <title>Electrolytes with Solvating Inner Sheath Engineering for Practical Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new category of electrolyte solvation structure is presented by engineering the solvating inner sheath for sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In a localized saturated electrolyte with 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, the saturated inner sheath features increased Na+&#8208;anion complex and decreased Na+&#8208;solvent distance, providing a durable Na anode interface and a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;solid sulfur conversion.








Abstract
Sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries with durable Na&#8208;metal stability, shuttle&#8208;free cyclability, and long lifespan are promising to large&#8208;scale energy storages. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses huge challenges with the existing electrolytes. Herein, a localized saturated electrolyte (LSE) is proposed with 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) as an inner sheath solvent, which represents a new category of electrolyte for Na&#8211;S system. Unlike the traditional high concentration electrolytes, the LSE is realized with a low salt&#8208;to&#8208;solvent ratio and low diluent&#8208;to&#8208;solvent ratio, which pushes the limit of localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE). The appropriate molecular structure and solvation ability of MeTHF regulate a saturated inner sheath, which features a reinforced coordination of Na+ to anions, enlarged Na+&#8208;solvent distance, and weakened anion&#8208;diluent interaction. Such electrolyte configuration is found to be the key to build a sustainable interphase and a quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;solid sulfur redox process, making a dendrite&#8208;inhibited and shuttle&#8208;free Na&#8211;S battery possible. With this electrolyte, pouch cells with decent cycling performance under rather demanding conditions are demonstrated.

The molecule&#8208;aggregate&#8208;domain transition dynamic process assisted by the volatile solid additive 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone (2&#8208;HM) is demonstrated, the role of 2&#8208;HM in individual donor and acceptor systems is unlocked, and its function in altering the bulk heterojunction to achieve forefront &#8776;19% efficiency for binary organic nonfullerene solar cells is further revealed.








Abstract
Organic nonfullerene solar cells (ONSCs) have made unprecedented progress; however, morphology optimization of ONSCs is proven to be particularly challenging relative to classical fullerene&#8208;based devices. Here, a novel volatile solid additive (VSA), 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone (2&#8208;HM), is reported for achieving high&#8208;efficiency ONSCs. 2&#8208;HM functions as a universal morphology&#8208;directing agent for several well&#8208;known PM6:Y6 series nonfullerene blends, viz. PM6:Y6, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, PM6:L8&#8208;BO, leading to a best efficiency of 18.85% at the forefront of reported binary ONSCs. VSAs have recently emerged, while the intrinsic kinetics is still unclear. Herein, a set of in situ and ex situ characterizations is employed to first illustrate the molecule&#8208;aggregate&#8208;domain transition dynamic process assisted by the VSA. More specifically, the role of 2&#8208;HM in individual donor PM6 and acceptor Y6 systems is unlocked, and the function of 2&#8208;HM in altering the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction blends is further revealed for enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is believed that the achievement brings not only a deep insight into emerging volatile solid additive, but also a new hope to further improve the molecular ordering, film microstructure, and relevant performance of ONSCs.

         <title>The Nanozyme Revolution: Enhancing the Performance of Medical Biosensing Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances and current challenges of enzyme&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles and their use in biosensing are highlighted, with a special focus on point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices and their translational path for use in biomedical devices. These materials exhibit innate advantages compared to biological enzymes and nanoparticle probes currently utilized and hold great promise for implementation in biotechnology and clinical diagnosis.








Abstract
Nanozymes represent a class of nanosized materials that exhibit innate catalytic properties similar to biological enzymes. The unique features of&#160;these materials have positioned them as promising candidates for applications in clinical sensing devices, specifically those&#160;employed at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. They notably have found use as a means to amplify signals in nanosensor&#8208;based platforms and thereby improve sensor detection limits. Recent developments in the understanding of the fundamental chemistries underpinning these materials have enabled the development of highly effective nanozymes capable of sensing clinically relevant biomarkers at detection limits that compete with &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; techniques. However, there remain considerable hurdles that need to be overcome before these nanozyme&#8208;based sensors can be utilized in a platform ready for clinical use. An overview of the current understandings of nanozymes for disease diagnostics and biosensing applications and the unmet challenges that must be considered prior to their translation in clinical diagnostic tests is provided.

         <title>Thermally Latent Bases in Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks and their Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally latent ammonium salt is synthesized and its on&#8208;demand release of a strong base is exploited for the selective activation of bond&#8208;exchange reactions in covalently crosslinked polymers. The thermally triggered (and local) change from a creep resistant behavior to a highly dynamic polymer network is demonstrated and applied for the reshaping/welding of 3D&#8208;printed objects and various composite structures.








Abstract
A novel strategy allowing temporal control of dynamic bond exchange in covalently crosslinked polymer networks via latent transesterification catalysts is introduced. Obtained by a straightforward air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant synthesis, the latent catalyst is designed for an irreversible temperature&#8208;mediated release of a strong organic base. Its long&#8208;term inactivity at temperatures below 50 &#176;C provides the unique opportunity to equip dynamic covalent networks with creep resistance and high bond&#8208;exchange rates, once activated. The presented thermally latent base catalyst is conveniently introducible in readily available building blocks and, as proof of concept, applied in a radically polymerized thiol&#8211;ene network. Light&#8208;mediated curing is used for 3D&#8208;printing functional objects, on which the possibility of spatially controlled reshaping and welding based on dynamic transesterification is illustrated. Since the catalyst is thermally activated, limitations regarding sample geometry and optical transparency do not apply, which facilitates a transfer to well&#8208;established industrial technologies. Consequently, fiber&#8208;reinforced and highly filled magneto&#8208;active thiol&#8211;ene polymer composites are fabricated by a thermal curing approach. The on&#8208;demand activation of dynamic transesterification is demonstrated by (magneto&#8208;assisted) reshaping experiments, highlighting a wide range of potential future applications offered by the presented concept.

         <title>Solvation Structure Modulation of High&#8208;Voltage Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance K&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the tetramethylene sulfone (TMS):dimethyl carbonate (DMC) binary electrolyte system, carbonate molecules and anions with better solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase forming capability are more likely to enter the solvation shell of K+, while sulfone molecules get close to the anions. As a result, both the storage of K+ at the graphite anode and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) at the graphite cathode are enhanced.








Abstract
Due to the advantages of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) and abundant resources, potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;carbon batteries (K&#8208;DCBs) have wide application prospects. However, conventional carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolyte systems have obvious drawbacks such as poor oxidation resistance and difficulty in sustaining the anion intercalation process at high voltages, which seriously affect the capacity and cycle performance of K&#8208;DCBs. Therefore, a rational design of more efficient novel electrolyte systems is urgently required to realize high&#8208;performance K&#8208;DCBs. Herein, a solvation structure modulation strategy for the K&#8208;DCB electrolyte systems is reported. Consequently, substantial K+ ion storage improvement at the graphite anode and enhanced bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) intercalation capacity at the graphite cathode are successfully realized simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the assembled K&#8208;DCB exhibited a discharge capacity of 103.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and after 400 cycles, &#8776;90% capacity retention is observed. Moreover, the energy density of the K&#8208;DCB full cell reached 157.6&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, which is the best performance in reported K&#8208;DCBs till date. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of solvation modulation in improving the performance of K&#8208;DCBs.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. Three&#8208;dimensional tumor&#8208;on&#8208;chip models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment, the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, and major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic tumor&#8208;on&#8208;chip models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.

Abstract
Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) shows promising prospects for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) while with restricted results, mainly attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the limited antibody permeability of blood&#8208;tumor&#8208;barrier (BTB) in GBM. Here, we described a macrophage&#8208;mimicking membrane vesicle that co&#8208;delivering chemotactic CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to pre&#8208;activate the immune microenvironment and anti&#8208;programmed death ligand 1 antibody (aPD&#8208;L1) to interrupt the immune checkpoint, aiming to enhance the effect of GBM immunotherapy. Consequently, tumor tropism of macrophage membrane and receptor mediated transcytosis of angiopeptide&#8208;2 peptide allowed the nano vesicle to effectively cross the BTB and target GBM region, with 19.75&#8208;fold higher antibodies accumulation compared to free aPD&#8208;L1 group. The CPI therapeutic efficacy was greatly enhanced by CXCL10 induced T cells recruitment with significant expansion of CD8+ T cells and effector memory T cells, leading to the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time and long&#8208;term immune memory in the orthotopic GBM mice. The nano vesicle that relieving tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by CXCL10 to enhance aPD&#8208;L1 efficacy might present a promising strategy for brain&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

Here, we described a macrophage-mimicking membrane vesicle that co-delivering chemotactic CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to pre-activate the immune microenvironment and anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibody (aPD-L1) to interrupt the immune checkpoint, aiming to enhance the effect of GBM immunotherapy. Consequently, tumor tropism of macrophage membrane and receptor mediated transcytosis of angiopeptide-2 peptide allowed the nano vesicle to effectively cross the BTB and target GBM region, with 19.75-fold higher antibodies accumulation compared to free aPD-L1 group.

         <title>Volumetric Printing across Melt Electrowritten Scaffolds Fabricates Multi&#8208;Material Living Constructs with Tunable Architecture and Mechanics</title>

Abstract
Major challenges in biofabrication revolve around capturing the complex, hierarchical composition of native tissues. However, individual 3D printing techniques have limited capacity to produce composite biomaterials with multi&#8208;scale resolution. Volumetric bioprinting recently emerged as a paradigm&#8208;shift in biofabrication. This ultra&#8208;fast, light&#8208;based technique sculpts cell&#8208;laden hydrogel bioresins into three&#8208;dimensional structures in a layerless fashion, providing enhanced design freedom over conventional bioprinting. However, it yields prints with low mechanical stability, since soft, cell&#8208;friendly hydrogels are used. Herein, for the first time, the possibility to converge volumetric bioprinting with melt electrowriting, which excels at patterning microfibers, is shown for the fabrication of tubular hydrogel&#8208;based composites with enhanced mechanical behavior. Despite including non&#8208;transparent melt electrowritten scaffolds into the volumetric printing process, high&#8208;resolution bioprinted structures were successfully achieved. Tensile, burst and bending mechanical properties of printed tubes were tuned altering the electrowritten mesh design, resulting in complex, multi&#8208;material tubular constructs with customizable, anisotropic geometries that better mimic intricate biological tubular structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, engineered tubular structures were obtained by building tri&#8208;layered cell&#8208;laden vessels, and features (valves, branches, fenestrations) that could be rapidly printed using this hybrid approach. This multi&#8208;technology convergence offers a new toolbox for manufacturing hierarchical and mechanically tunable multi&#8208;material living structures.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring Crystal Orientation and Passivating Surface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solar cells (PSCs) with quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskites (RPP) exhibit greater environmental stability than 3D perovskites; however, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) caused by anisotropic crystal orientations and defect sites in the bulk RPP materials limit future commercialization. Herein we report a simple posttreatment for the top surfaces of RPP thin films (RPP composition of PEA2MA4Pb5I16 &lt;n&gt; = 5) in which zwitterionic n&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN) is used as the passivation material. The PBN molecules passivate the surface and grain boundary defects in the RPP and simultaneously induce vertical direction crystal orientations of the RPPs, which leads to efficient charge transport in the RPP photoactive materials. With this surface engineering methodology, the optimized devices exhibited a remarkably enhanced PCE of 20.05% as compared with the devices without PBN (&#8764;17.53%) and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with 88% retention of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation for over 1,000&#160;h. The proposed passivation strategy provides new insights into the development of efficient and stable RPP&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Weaving Aerogels into a 3D Ordered Hyperelastic Hybrid Carbon Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon assembly with a combination of extraordinary electrochemical and mechanical properties is desirable yet challenging. Herein, an ultralight and hyperelastic nanofiber&#8208;woven hybrid carbon assembly (NWHCA) is fabricated by nanofiber weaving of isotropic porous and mechanical brittle quasi&#8208;aerogels. Upon subsequent pyrolysis, metallogel&#8208;derived quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization and nitrogen/phosphorus co&#8208;doping were integrated into the NWHCA. Finite element simulation indicates that the 3D lamella&#8208;bridge architecture of NWHCA with the quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization contributes to resisting plastic deformation and structural damage under high compression, experimentally demonstrated by complete deformation recovery at 80% compression and unprecedented fatigue resistance (&gt; 94% retention after 5000 cycles). Due to the superelasticity and quasi&#8208;aerogel integration, the zinc&#8208;air battery assembled based on NWHCA shows excellent electrochemical performance and flexibility. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept integrated device is presented, in which the flexible battery powers a piezoresistive sensor, using the NWHCA as the air cathode and the elastic conductor respectively, which could detect full&#8208;range and sophisticated motions while attached to human skin. The nanofiber weaving strategy allows the construction of lightweight, superelastic, and multifunctional hybrid carbon assemblies with great potential in wearable and integrated electronics.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Engineering with 2,2&#8208;Azodi(2&#8208;Methylbutyronitrile)&#160;for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique intermediate phase engineering strategy is developed to overcome the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 film with organic ammonium salts by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;azodi(2&#8208;methylbutyronitrile) to both PbI2 precursor solution and organic ammonium salts. This helps to achieve perovskite solar cells with efficiency &gt;25% and good stability of remaining 96% initial efficiency in the maximum power point tracking measurement after 1000 h.








Abstract
Sequential deposition has been widely employed to modulate the crystallization of perovskite solar cells because it can avoid the formation of nucleation centers and even initial crystallization in the precursor solution. However, challenges remain in overcoming the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 films with organic ammonium salts. Herein, a unique intermediate phase engineering strategy has been developed by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;azodi(2&#8208;methylbutyronitrile) (AMBN) to both PbI2 and ammonium salt solutions to regulate perovskite crystallization. AMBN not only coordinates with PbI2 to form a favorably mesoporous PbI2 film due to the coordination between Pb2+ and the cyano group (C&#8801;N), but also suppresses the vigorous activity of FA+ ions by interacting with FAI, leading to the full PbI2 transformation with the preferred orientation. Therefore, perovskites with favorable facet orientations are obtained, and the defects are largely suppressed owing to the passivation of uncoordinated Pb2+ and FA+. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency over 25% with a stabilized efficiency of 24.8% is achieved. Moreover, the device exhibits an improved operational stability, retaining 96% of initial power conversion efficiency under 1000 h continuous white&#8208;light illumination with an intensity of 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C in N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Highly Efficient Mixed Conduction in a Fused Oligomer n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductor Enabled by 3D Transport Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fused and highly electron&#8208;deficient oligomeric organic semiconductor bridging the small&#8208;molecule and polymeric semiconductor domains is presented. By careful control of side&#8208;chain motifs, a highly efficient mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor is obtained. The high performance is ascribed to favorable interactions between semiconductor and aqueous electrolyte that result in a molecular packing with oblique orientation enabling 3D transport pathways.








Abstract
Tailoring organic semiconductors to facilitate mixed conduction of ionic and electronic charges when interfaced with an aqueous media has spurred many recent advances in organic bioelectronics. The field is still restricted, however, by very few n&#8208;type (electron&#8208;transporting) organic semiconductors with adequate performance metrics. Here, a new electron&#8208;deficient, fused polycyclic aromatic system, TNR, is reported with excellent n&#8208;type mixed conduction properties including a &#181;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value exceeding 30 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for the best performing derivative. Comprising three naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin moieties, this new molecular design builds on successful small&#8208;molecule mixed conductors; by extending the molecular scaffold into the oligomer domain, good film&#8208;forming properties, strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and consequently excellent charge&#8208;transport properties are obtained. Through judicious optimization of the side chains, the linear oligoether and branched alkyl chain derivative bgTNR is obtained which shows superior mixed conduction in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration including an electron mobility around 0.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. By optimizing the side chains, the dominant molecular packing can be changed from a preferential edge&#8208;on orientation (with high charge&#8208;transport anisotropy) to an oblique orientation that can support 3D transport pathways which in turn ensure highly efficient mixed conduction properties across the bulk semiconductor film.

     alt="Highly Efficient Mixed Conduction in a Fused Oligomer n-Type Organic Semiconductor Enabled by 3D Transport Pathways"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fused and highly electron-deficient oligomeric organic semiconductor bridging the small-molecule and polymeric semiconductor domains is presented. By careful control of side-chain motifs, a highly efficient mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor is obtained. The high performance is ascribed to favorable interactions between semiconductor and aqueous electrolyte that result in a molecular packing with oblique orientation enabling 3D transport pathways.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;based Electrochemical Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental role played by the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of few layers graphene (FLG)&#8208;electrodes, in rising the electrical power output of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs, 530 mW m&#8722;2) is unveiled. Highly capacitive FLG electrodes are obtained by integrating electrolyte gel composites based on 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides. This work introduces a novel design concept leading to sustainable electrochemical&#8208;TENGs.








Abstract
The integration of 2D materials in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is known to increase the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical power conversion efficiency. 2D materials are used in TENGs with multiple roles as triboelectric material, charge&#8208;trapping fillers, or as electrodes. Here, novel TENGs based on few&#8208;layers graphene (FLG) electrodes and stable gel electrolytes composed of liquid phase exfoliated 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides and polyvinyl alcohol are developed. TENGs embedding FLG and gel composites show competitive open&#8208;circuit voltage (&#8776; 300 V), instant peak power (530 mW m&#8722;2), and stability (&gt; 11 months). These values correspond to a seven&#8208;fold higher electrical output compared to TENGs embedding bare FLG electrodes. It is demonstrated that such a significant improvement depends on the high electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of FLG electrodes functionalized with the gel composites. The wet encapsulation of the TENGs is shown to be an effective strategy to increase their power output further highlighting the EDLC role. It is also shown that the EDLC is dependent upon the transition metal (W vs Mo) rather than the relative abundance of 1T or 2H phases. Overall, this work lays down the roots for novel sustainable electrochemical&#8208;(e)&#8208;TENGs developed exploiting strategies typically used in electrochemical capacitors.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concepts of water harvesting from air are discussed and correlated with the properties required for covalent organic framework (COF) water harvesters. Strategies for designing water harvesting COFs are also summarized.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting using reticular materials is an innovation that has the potential to change the world. Using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for capturing water holds great promise because COFs are metal&#8208;free, stable under working conditions, and their structure can be intentionally designed to meet the requirements for this application. To promote the chemistry and use of COFs for atmospheric water harvesting, important features for synthesizing suitable water&#8208;harvesting COFs are discussed. The achievements of using COFs as water harvesters are then highlighted, showing how the water harvesting properties are related to the structural design. Finally, perspectives and research directions for further studies in COF chemistry are provided.

         <title>Electric Control of 2D Van Hove Singularity in Oxide Ultra&#8208;Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van Hove singularity (VHS) possesses an infinite density of states at a certain energy point when it exists in two dimensions. By taking advantage of this two&#8208;dimensional VHS property, it is demonstrated that the type of charge carrier can be tuned in oxide ultrathin film systems, showing the potential for practical devices.








Abstract
Divergent density of states (DOS) can induce extraordinary phenomena such as significant enhancement of superconductivity and unexpected phase transitions. Moreover, van Hove singularities (VHSs) lead to divergent DOS in 2D systems. Despite recent interest in VHSs, only a few controllable cases have been reported to date. In this work, by utilizing an atomically ultra&#8208;thin SrRuO3 film, the electronic structure of a 2D VHS is investigated with angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport properties are controlled. By applying electric fields with alkali metal deposition and ionic&#8208;liquid gating methods, the 2D VHS and the sign of the charge carrier are precisely controlled. Use of a tunable 2D VHS in an atomically flat oxide film could serve as a new strategy to realize infinite DOS near the Fermi level, thereby allowing efficient tuning of electric properties.

         <title>Bioengineered 3D Skeletal Muscle Model Reveals Complement 4b as a Cell&#8208;Autonomous Mechanism of Impaired Regeneration with Aging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic skeletal muscle aging model&#160;is&#160;presented that recapitulates age&#8208;related declines in muscle function and regeneration while resembling the responses of aged muscle to therapeutic treatments. Using the developed muscle aging model, complement component 4b inhibition is identified as a novel approach to improve aged muscle repair.








Abstract
A mechanistic understanding of cell&#8208;autonomous skeletal muscle changes after injury can lead to novel interventions to improve functional recovery in an aged population. However, major knowledge gaps persist owing to limitations of traditional&#160;biological aging models. 2D cell culture represents an artificial environment, while aging mammalian models are contaminated by influences from non&#8208;muscle cells and other organs. Here, a 3D muscle aging system is created to overcome the limitations of these traditional platforms. It is shown that old muscle constructs (OMC) manifest a sarcopenic phenotype, as evidenced by hypotrophic myotubes, reduced contractile function, and decreased regenerative capacity compared to young muscle constructs. OMC also phenocopy the regenerative responses of aged muscle to two interventions, pharmacological and biological. Interrogation of muscle cell&#8208;specific mechanisms that contribute to impaired regeneration over time further reveals that an aging&#8208;induced increase of complement component 4b (C4b) delays muscle progenitor cell amplification and impairs functional recovery. However, administration of complement factor I, a C4b inactivator, improves muscle regeneration in vitro and in vivo, indicating that C4b inhibition may be a novel approach to enhance aged muscle repair. Collectively, the model herein exhibits capabilities to study cell&#8208;autonomous changes in skeletal muscle during aging, regeneration, and intervention.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a robust manufacturing method to prepare structured carbon materials using low&#8208;cost commodity plastic as precursors, paired with simple and scalable processes. The crack generation upon diffusion&#8208;controlled sulfonation crosslinking provides an important mechanism to ensure full crosslinking of 3D printed PP parts, enabling their efficient conversion to mechanically robust carbon products.








Abstract
Carbon materials are essential to the development of modern society with indispensable use in various applications, such as energy storage and high&#8208;performance composites. Despite great progress, on&#8208;demand carbon manufacturing with control over 3D&#160;macroscopic configuration is still an intractable challenge, hindering their direct use in many areas requiring structured materials and products. This work introduces a simple and scalable method to generate complex, large&#8208;scale carbon structures using easily accessible materials and technologies. 3D&#8208;printed, commercial polypropylene (PP) parts can be thermally stabilized through cracking&#8208;facilitated diffusion and crosslinking. The newly elucidated mechanism from this work allows thick PP parts to yield carbonaceous products with complex structures through a subsequent pyrolysis step. The approach for enabling PP&#8208;to&#8208;carbon conversion has consistent product yield and controlled dimensional shrinkage. Under optimized processing conditions, these PP&#8208;derived carbons exhibit robust mechanical properties and excellent joule heating performance, demonstrated by their versatile use as heating elements. Furthermore, this process can be extended to recycled PP, enabling the conversion of waste plastic materials to value&#8208;added products. This work provides an innovative approach to create structured carbon materials with direct access to complex geometry, which can be transformative to, and broadly benefit, many important technological applications.

         <title>DNA Nanoclusters Combined with One&#8208;Shot Radiotherapy Augment Cancer Immunotherapy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>

A programmable CpG DNA nanocluster termed as DNAnc loads &#8776;8125 copies of CpG ODNs in a single nanoparticle. It efficiently repolarizes macrophages from an M2&#8208;like phenotype into an M1&#8208;like phenotype to elicit a robust abscopal effect, which successfully stimulates CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cells&#8208;mediated suppression of tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence after one&#8208;shot radiotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy shows immense promise for improving cancer treatment. Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy provides a conspicuous advantage due to its enhanced abscopal effect. However, established immune tolerance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment can hamper the generation of a sufficient abscopal effect. Herein, a type of DNA nanocluster (DNAnc) that is self&#8208;assembled by a CpG&#8208;ODNs&#8208;loaded Y&#8208;shaped double&#8208;stranded DNA vector based on the unique complementary base&#8208;pairing rules is designed. The unique structure of DNAnc makes it load more than &#8776;8125.5 &#177; 822.5 copies of CpG ODNs within one single nanostructure, which effectively increases resistance to nuclease degradation and elevates the efficiency of repolarizing macrophages to an M1&#8208;like phenotype. Mechanistic studies reveal that more DNAncs are endocytosed by macrophages in the cancer tissue and repolarized macrophages to elicit a robust abscopal effect with the accumulation of macrophages induced by radiotherapy, generating potent, long&#8208;term, and durable antitumor immunity for the inhibition of tumor metastasis and the prevention of tumor recurrence, which provides a novel strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>300&#8208;Times&#8208;Increased Diffusive Skyrmion Dynamics and Effective Pinning Reduction by Periodic Field Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated Brownian motion is key for skyrmion devices in non&#8208;conventional computing. A drastic increase in skyrmion diffusion and enhanced skyrmion stability is reported due to periodic magnetic field excitations. Adjusting the strength of the oscillations, the pinning landscape can be tailored continuously and switch from a pinning&#8208;dominated to a free&#8208;like motion regime.








Abstract
Thermally induced skyrmion dynamics, as well as skyrmion pinning effects, in thin films have attracted significant interest. While pinning poses challenges in deterministic skyrmion devices and slows down skyrmion diffusion, for applications in non&#8208;conventional computing, both pinning of an appropriate strength and skyrmion diffusion speed are key. Here, periodic field excitations are employed to realize an increase of the skyrmion diffusion by more than two orders of magnitude. Amplifying the excitation, a drastic reduction of the effective skyrmion pinning, is reported, and a transition from pinning&#8208;dominated diffusive hopping to dynamics approaching free diffusion is observed. By tailoring the field oscillation frequency and amplitude, a continuous tuning of the effective pinning and skyrmion dynamics is demonstrated, which is a key asset and enabler for non&#8208;conventional computing applications. It is found that the periodic excitations additionally allow stabilization of skyrmions at different sizes for field values that are inaccessible in static systems, opening up new approaches to ultrafast skyrmion motion by transiently exciting moving skyrmions.

         <title>N&#63743;B&#63743;OH Site&#8208;Activated Graphene Quantum Dots for Boosting Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations predict that the edge structure involving edge N, B dopant pairs and further &#63743;OH functionalization to the B is an active center for 2 e&#8722; ORR. GQDs with an enriched density of N&#63743;B&#63743;OH show high H2O2 selectivity (over 90%), stability and H2O2 production rate (709 mmol&#160;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), superior to most reported carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Carbon materials are considered promising 2/4 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for synthesizing H2O2/H2O via regulating heteroatom dopants and functionalization. Here, various doped and functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are designed to reveal the crucial active sites of carbon materials for ORR to produce H2O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that the edge structure involving edge N, B dopant pairs and further &#63743;OH functionalization to the B (N&#63743;B&#63743;OH) is an active center for 2e&#8722; ORR. To verify the above predication, GQDs with an enriched density of N&#63743;B&#63743;OH (NBO&#8208;GQDs) are designed and synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction of &#63743;NH2 edge&#8208;functionalized GQDs with H3BO3 forming six&#8208;member heterocycle containing the N&#63743;B&#63743;OH structure. When dispersed on conductive carbon substrates, the NBO&#8208;GQDs show H2O2 selectivity of over 90% at 0.7 &#8211;0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in the alkaline solution in a rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode setup. The selectivity retains 90% of the initial value after 12 h stability test. In a flow cell setup, the H2O2 production rate is up to 709 mmol gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, superior to most reported carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work provides molecular insight into the design and formulation of highly efficient carbon&#8208;based catalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.

Targeting at prioritizing zincophilic sites for high&#8208;efficiency Zn anode, a theory&#8208;to&#8208;application metric is established via various hetero metals and synthetic solvents. The elaborate &#8220;thermodynamics inertia and kinetics metalphilia&#8221; metrics for the rational selection and design of the artificial interfaces can benchmark the success of other metal&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
Poor thermodynamic stability and sluggish electrochemical kinetics of metallic Zn anode in aqueous solution greatly hamper its practical application. To solve such problems, to date, various zincophilic surface modification strategies are developed, which can facilitate reversible Zn plating/stripping behavior. However, there is still a lack of systematic and fundamental understanding regarding the metrics of thermodynamics inertia and kinetics zincophilia in selecting zincophilic sites. Herein, hetero&#8208;metallic interfaces are prioritized for the first time via optimizing different hetero metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, Bi, Cu, Zn, etc.) and synthetic solvents (ethanol, ethylene glycol, n&#8208;propanol, etc.). Specifically, both theoretical simulations and experimental results suggest that this Bi@Zn interface can exhibit high efficiency owing to the thermodynamics inertia and kinetics zincophilia. A best practice for prioritizing zincophilic sites in a more practical metric is also proposed. As a proof of concept, the Bi@Zn anode delivers ultralow overpotential of &#8776;55&#160;mV at a high rate of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable cycle life over 4700 cycles. The elaborated &#8220;thermodynamics inertia and kinetics metalphilia&#8221; metrics for hetero&#8208;metallic interfaces can benchmark the success of other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Strongly Correlated Exciton&#8208;Magnetization System for Optical Spin Pumping in CrBr3 and CrI3.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium trihalides are considered canonical two&#8208;dimensional ferromagnets. The emergent magnetization is coupled with the photoexcited excitons via exchange interactions. Despite chemical and structural similarities, the nature of this coupling is qualitatively different between CrBr3 and CrI3. The opposite sign of the hole&#8208;magnetization coupling enables realization of optical spin pumping in CrBr3, revealing the origin of ferromagnetic hysteresis in photoluminescence experiments.








Abstract
Ferromagnetism in van der Waals systems, preserved down to a monolayer limit, attracted attention to a class of materials with general composition CrX3 (X=I, Br, and Cl), which are treated now as canonical 2D ferromagnets. Their diverse magnetic properties, such as different easy axes or varying and controllable character of in&#8208;plane or interlayer ferromagnetic coupling, make them promising candidates for spintronic, photonic, optoelectronic, and other applications. Still, significantly different magneto&#8208;optical properties between the three materials have been presenting a challenging puzzle for researchers over the last few years. Herewith, it is demonstrated that despite similar structural and magnetic configurations, the coupling between excitons and magnetization is qualitatively different in CrBr3 and CrI3 films. Through a combination of the optical spin pumping experiments with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theory describing bound excitonic states in the presence of magnetization, we&#160;concluded that the hole&#8208;magnetization coupling has the opposite sign in CrBr3 and CrI3 and also between the ground and excited exciton state. Consequently, efficient spin pumping capabilities are demonstrated in CrBr3 driven by magnetization via spin&#8208;dependent absorption, and the different origins of the magnetic hysteresis in CrBr3 and CrI3 are unraveled.

         <title>Boosting the Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Performance of 2D Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet&#8208;Based Sonosensitizers Via Crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous Phase Transformation</title>

The crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation is proposed as a simple but powerful strategy to engineer ultrathin 2D CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets as high&#8208;efficiency sonosensitizers for sonodynamic cancer therapy, thus achieving cell death and tumor eradication under US irradiation.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has been a promising therapeutic modality for cancer because of its superior advantages compared with other therapeutic strategies. However, the current sonosensitizers used for SDT normally exhibit low activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Herein, the crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation is reported as a simple but powerful strategy to engineer ultrathin 2D CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets as highly efficient sonosensitizers for SDT. The phase transformation of CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets from polycrystalline to amorphous ones is achieved through a simple acid etching treatment. Importantly, compared with the polycrystalline one, the amorphous CoW&#8208;LDH (a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH) nanosheets possess higher ROS generation activity under US irradiation, which is &#8776;17 times of the commercial TiO2 sonosensitizer. The results suggest that the enhanced performance of ultrathin a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH nanosheets for US&#8208;induced ROS generation may be attributed to the phase transformation&#8208;induced defect generation and electronic structure changes. After polyethylene glycol modification, the a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH nanosheets can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency sonosensitizer for SDT to achieve cell death in vitro and tumor eradication in vivo under US irradiation.

         <title>Giant Exchange&#8208;Bias&#8208;Like Effect at Low Cooling Fields Induced by Pinned Magnetic Domains in Y2NiIrO6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The octahedral distortion in Y2NiIrO6 favors orbital&#8208;lattice coupling with the orbital moment along the short Ir&#8211;O bonds, eventually leading to the pinning of magnetic domains. It results in substantial vertical shifts of the magnetic loops under small cooling fields and in turn the huge asymmetry of left and right coercive fields, namely giant exchange&#8208;bias&#8208;like fields.








Abstract
Exchange bias (EB) is highly desirable for widespread technologies. Generally, conventional exchange&#8208;bias heterojunctions require excessively large cooling fields for sufficient bias fields, which are generated by pinned spins at the interface of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers. It is crucial for applicability to obtain considerable exchange&#8208;bias fields with minimum cooling fields. Here, an exchange&#8208;bias&#8208;like effect is reported in a double perovskite, Y2NiIrO6, which shows long&#8208;range ferrimagnetic ordering below 192 K. It displays a giant bias&#8208;like field of 1.1 T with a cooling field of only 15&#160;Oe at 5 K. This robust phenomenon appears below 170 K. This fascinating bias&#8208;like effect is the secondary effect of the vertical shifts of the magnetic loops, which is attributed to the pinned magnetic domains due to the combination of strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling on Ir, and antiferromagnetically coupled Ni&#8208; and Ir&#8208;sublattices. The pinned moments in Y2NiIrO6 are present throughout the full volume, not just at the interface as in conventional bilayer systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermo&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive polymer&#8211;glucose oxidase conjugate shows significant improvements in cellular uptake, intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation, cytotoxicity, and tumor cell spheroid penetration under acidic conditions. The conjugate penetrates into the whole tumor&#160;tissue but hardly diffuses into the normal tissues, resulting in the eradication of the tumors in mice without perceivable side effects and inducing a robust antitumor immunity .








Abstract
Protein drugs are increasingly used as therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. However, their inherent drawbacks, such as poor stability, low cell membrane and tissue permeability, lack of tumor selectivity, and severe side effects, limit their wide applications in cancer therapy. Herein, screening of a thermo&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive polymer&#8211;glucose oxidase conjugate that can controllably self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles with improved stability is reported. The size, surface charge, and bioactivity of the conjugate can be tuned by adjustment of the solution temperature and pH. The cellular uptake, intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation, and tumor cell spheroid penetration of the conjugate are greatly enhanced under the acidic tumor microenvironment, leading to increased cytotoxicity to tumor cells. Upon a single intratumoural injection, the conjugate penetrates into the whole tumor tissue but hardly diffuses into the normal tissues, resulting in the eradication of the tumors in mice without perceivable side effects. Simultaneously, the conjugate induces a robust antitumor immunity to efficiently inhibit the growth of distant tumors, especially in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

&lt;p&gt;A thermo-pH-sensitive polymer&#8211;glucose oxidase conjugate shows significant improvements in cellular uptake, intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation, cytotoxicity, and tumor cell spheroid penetration under acidic conditions. The conjugate penetrates into the whole tumor&#160;tissue but hardly diffuses into the normal tissues, resulting in the eradication of the tumors in mice without perceivable side effects and inducing a robust antitumor immunity .

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein drugs are increasingly used as therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. However, their inherent drawbacks, such as poor stability, low cell membrane and tissue permeability, lack of tumor selectivity, and severe side effects, limit their wide applications in cancer therapy. Herein, screening of a thermo-pH-sensitive polymer&#8211;glucose oxidase conjugate that can controllably self-assemble into nanoparticles with improved stability is reported. The size, surface charge, and bioactivity of the conjugate can be tuned by adjustment of the solution temperature and pH. The cellular uptake, intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation, and tumor cell spheroid penetration of the conjugate are greatly enhanced under the acidic tumor microenvironment, leading to increased cytotoxicity to tumor cells. Upon a single intratumoural injection, the conjugate penetrates into the whole tumor tissue but hardly diffuses into the normal tissues, resulting in the eradication of the tumors in mice without perceivable side effects. Simultaneously, the conjugate induces a robust antitumor immunity to efficiently inhibit the growth of distant tumors, especially in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. These findings provide a novel and general strategy to make multifunctional protein-polymer conjugates with responsiveness to the acidic tumor microenvironment for selective tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Semiconductors with Good Ductility and High Charge Mobility through Reducing the Central Symmetry of the Conjugated Backbone Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors with good ductility and high charge mobility are designed and investigated by incorporating non&#8208;centrosymmetric spiro&#8208;fluorene units into the backbones of the DPP&#8208;based conjugated polymers. Compared with the parent conjugated polymer, the terpolymers show low moduli and good semiconducting performance both under mechanical deformation and against cyclic strains.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors are highly demanding for flexible electronics. However, it still remains challenging to achieve synergy between intrinsic stretchability and charge transport property properly for polymer semiconductors. In this paper, terpolymers are reported as intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors with good ductility and high charge mobility simultaneously by incorporation of non&#8208;centrosymmetric spiro[cycloalkane&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] (spiro&#8208;fluorene) units into the backbone of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based conjugated polymers. The results reveal that these terpolymers show obviously high crack onset strains and their tensile moduli are remarkably reduced, by comparing with the parent DPP&#8208;based conjugated polymer without spiro&#8208;fluorene units. They exhibit simultaneously high charge mobilities (&gt;1.0 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) at 100% strain and even after repeated stretching and releasing cycles for 500 times under 50% strain. The terpolymer P2, in which cyclopropane is linked to the spiro&#8208;fluorene unit, is among the best reported intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors with record mobility up to 3.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at even 150% strain and 1.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 after repeated stretching and releasing cycles for 1000 times.

         <title>Boosting Ferroptosis Therapy with Iridium Single&#8208;Atom Nanocatalyst in Ultralow Metal Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium (Ir) single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with fully exposed active sites is synthesized to effectively catalyze the conversion of endogenous H2O2 to &#8226;OH and depletion of glutathione with ultralow metal content in the tumor microenvironment. With an advanced support of GSH&#8208;trapping platinum(IV) and encapsulation with a red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell membrane, this nanoagent (Pt@IrSAC/RBC) causes intense lipid peroxidation that boosts tumor cell ferroptosis.








Abstract
Nanocatalysts are promising tumor therapeutics due to their ability to induce reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment. Although increasing metal loading can improve catalytic activity, the quandary of high metal content versus potential systemic biotoxicity remains challenging. Here, a fully exposed active site strategy by site&#8208;specific anchoring of single iridium (Ir) atoms on the outer surface of a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composite (Ir single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC)) is reported to achieve remarkable catalytic performance at ultralow metal content (&#8776;0.11%). The Ir SAC exhibits prominent dual enzymatic activities to mimic peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of endogenous H2O2 into &#8226;OH in the acidic TME and depletes glutathione (GSH) simultaneously. With an advanced support of GSH&#8208;trapping platinum(IV) and encapsulation with a red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell membrane, this nanocatalytic agent (Pt@IrSAC/RBC) causes intense lipid peroxidation that boosts tumor cell ferroptosis. The Pt@IrSAC/RBC demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy in a mouse triple&#8208;negative mammary carcinoma model, resulting in complete tumor ablation in a single treatment session with negligible side effects. These outcomes may provide valuable insights into the design of nanocatalysts with high performance and biosafety for biomedical applications.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymer with Hierarchical Structure and Limited Volume Expansion for Ultrafast and Highly Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing sustainable organic electrode materials with high&#8208;rate capability and satisfactory cycle lifespan is one of the key parameters for exploiting the next&#8208;generation sodium&#8208;ion batteries at practical levels. In this work, a facile polymerization strategy is developed for preparing a porous organic polymer with a hierarchical structure and limited volume expansion that enables ultrafast and highly durable sodium storage.








Abstract
Sustainable organic electrode materials, as promising alternatives to conventional inorganic electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), are still challenging to realize long&#8208;lifetime and high&#8208;rate batteries because of their poor conductivity, limited electroactivity, and severe dissolution. It is also urgent to deeply reveal their electrochemical mechanism and evolution processes. A porous organic polymer (POP) with a conjugated and hierarchical structure is designed and synthesized here. The unique molecule and structure endow the POP with electron delocalization, high ionic diffusivity, plentiful active sites, exceptional structure stability, and limited solubility in electrolytes. When evaluated as an anode for SIBs, the POP exhibits appealing electrochemical properties regarding reversible capacity, rate behaviors, and long&#8208;duration life. Importantly, using judiciously combined experiments and theoretical computation, including in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ex situ spectroscopy,&#160;we&#160;reveal the Na&#8208;storage mechanism and dynamic evolution processes of the POP, including 12&#8208;electron reaction process with Na, low volume expansion (125&#8211;106% vs the initial 100%), and stable composition and structure evolution during repeating sodiation/de&#8208;sodiation processes. This quantitative design for ultrafast and highly durable sodium storage in the POP could be of immediate benefit for the rational design of organic electrode materials with ideal electrochemical properties.

         <title>Band Engineering of the Second Phase to Reach High Thermoelectric Performance in Cu2Se&#8208;Based Composite Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The band energy of the second phase is proposed to diminish the electric scattering caused by nanophase incorporation. It realizes similar electronic structures and different phonon structures between the Cu2Se and dispersed nano&#8208;Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06, which maintain a high power factor and suppress the thermal conductivity, resulting in a figure of merit (zT) value of 2.34 at 850 K.








Abstract
Hitherto, Cu2Se incorporated with a dispersed second phase shows extremely low thermal conductivity and excellent thermoelectric properties. However, the significant mismatch in electronic band structure between the second phases and the matrix often causes a deterioration of carrier mobility. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the electronic band structure of the second phase is adjusted through doping S and Te. It is found that Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 has a highly similar electronic band structure to the Cu2Se matrix, which results in high carrier mobility and power factor in Cu2Se&#8208;based composite materials. Additionally, the dispersed second&#8208;phase Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06, dislocations, and nanograins are observed in the Cu2Se/5 wt% Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 product, which leads to a substantial reduction in the thermal conductivity. Finally, high figure of merit (zT) values of 2.04 (by Dulong&#8211;Petit heat capacity) and 2.34 (by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measured heat capacity) are achieved at 850 K, which are about 65% higher than that of Cu2Se in this work and comparable to the recently reported p&#8208;type Cu2Se with outstanding performance.

It is found that Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt; has a highly similar electronic band structure to the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se matrix, which results in high carrier mobility and power factor in Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se-based composite materials. Additionally, the dispersed second-phase Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;, dislocations, and nanograins are observed in the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/5 wt% Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt; product, which leads to a substantial reduction in the thermal conductivity. Finally, high figure of merit (&lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt;) values of 2.04 (by Dulong&#8211;Petit heat capacity) and 2.34 (by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measured heat capacity) are achieved at 850 K, which are about 65% higher than that of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se in this work and comparable to the recently reported p-type Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se with outstanding performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Fluorinated Covalent Organic Framework with Accelerated Oxygen Transfer Nanochannels for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorinated covalent organic framework (COF) engineering strategy is used to develop high&#8208;performance air cathodes for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. The fluorinated COF nanopores are employed as an oxygen high&#8208;speed channel, which are then assembled into aerophilic &#8220;nano&#8208;islands&#8221; on the hydrophilic FeNi LDH catalyst. Therefore, the mass&#8208;transport &#8220;highway&#8221; for O2 and water is segregated on the nanoscale, which significantly enlarges the area of three&#8208;phase boundaries and greatly promotes the mass&#8208;transfer therein.








Abstract
The establishment of abundant three&#8208;phase interfaces with accelerated mass transfer in air cathodes is highly desirable for the development of high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable&#160;zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit tailored nanopore structures, facilitating the rational tuning of their specific properties. Here, by finely tuning the fluorinated nanopores of a COF, a novel air cathode for rechargeable ZABs is unprecedentedly designed and synthesized. COF&#160;nanosheets are decorated with fluorinated alkyl chains, which shows high affinity to oxygen (O2), in its nanopores (fluorinated COF). The fluorinated COF&#160;nanosheets are stacked into well&#8208;defined O2&#8208;transport channels, which are then assembled into aerophilic &#8220;nano&#8208;islands&#8221; on the hydrophilic FeNi layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (FeNi LDH) electrocatalyst surface. Therefore, the mass&#8208;transport &#8220;highway&#8221; for O2 and water is segregated on the nanoscale, which significantly enlarges the area of three&#8208;phase boundaries and greatly promotes the mass&#8208;transfer therein. ZABs based on the COF&#8208;modified air cathode deliver a small charge/discharge voltage gap (0.64&#160;V at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), a peak power density (118&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a stable cyclability. This work provides a feasible approach for the design of the air cathodes for high&#8208;performance ZABs, and will expand the new application of COFs.

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced Ferroelectricity in Antiferroelectric Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding size effects in antiferroelectrics provides important information for optimizing the performance of energy&#8208;storage devices at small scales. Direct experimental evidence for intrinsic size&#8208;driven scaling is demonstrated in lead&#8208;free antiferroelectric NaNbO3 membranes, in which an intriguing antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric transition occurs upon reducing thickness, leading a ferroelectric phase in thin membranes and coexistence of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases in thick membranes.








Abstract
Despite extensive studies on size effects in ferroelectrics, how structures and properties evolve in antiferroelectrics with reduced dimensions still remains elusive. Given the enormous potential of utilizing antiferroelectrics for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage applications, understanding their size effects will provide key information for optimizing device performances at small scales. Here, the fundamental intrinsic size dependence of antiferroelectricity in lead&#8208;free NaNbO3 membranes is investigated. Via a wide range of experimental and theoretical approaches, an intriguing antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric transition upon reducing membrane thickness is probed. This size effect leads to a ferroelectric single&#8208;phase below 40&#160;nm, as well as a mixed&#8208;phase state with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orders coexisting above this critical thickness. Furthermore, it is shown that the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders are electrically switchable. First&#8208;principle calculations further reveal that the observed transition is driven by the structural distortion arising from the membrane surface. This work provides direct experimental evidence for intrinsic size&#8208;driven scaling in antiferroelectrics and demonstrates enormous potential of utilizing size effects to drive emergent properties in environmentally benign lead&#8208;free oxides with the membrane platform.

         <title>Reaction Site Designation by Intramolecular Electric Field in Tr&#246;ger's&#8208;Base&#8208;Derived Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Near&#8208;Unity Selectivity of CO2 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rigid V&#8208;shaped configured Tr&#246;ger's base is introduced to the construction of a covalent microporous polymer. Superior CO2 adsorption/activation capacity and an intramolecular electric field of the polymer are demonstrated. The carrier&#8208;recombination suppression and reaction&#8208;site designation from the synergy of the conjugated network and intramolecular electric field result in a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with approximately unity CO selectivity.








Abstract
To facilitate solar&#8208;driven overall CO2 and H2O convsersion into fuels and O2, a series of covalent microporous polymers derived from Tr&#246;ger's base are synthesized featuring flexural backbone and unusual charge&#8208;transfer properties. The incorporation of rigid structural twist Tr&#246;ger's base unit grants the polymers enhanced microporosity and CO2 adsorption/activation capacity. Density function theory calculations and photo&#8208;electrochemical analyses reveal that an electric dipole moment (from negative to positive) directed to the Tr&#246;ger's base unit is formed across two obliquely opposed molecular fragments and induces an intramolecular electric field. The Tr&#246;ger's base unit located at folding point becomes an electron trap to attract photogenerated electrons in the molecular network, which brings about suppression of carrier recombination and designates the reaction site in synergy with the conjugated network. In response to the discrepancy in reaction pathways across the reaction sites, the product allocation in the catalytic reaction is thereby regulated. Optimally, CMP&#8208;nTB achieves the highest photocatalytic CO production of 163.53&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with approximately unity selectivity, along with H2O oxidation to O2 in the absence of any photosensitizer or co&#8208;catalyst. This work provides new insight for developing specialized artificial organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Rapid and Direct Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Luminescent Metal Halide Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy to rapidly and directly crystallize luminescent metal halide nanocrystals into close&#8208;packed face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) superlattices during the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis is demonstrated. The concomitant nanocrystal growth and superlattice formation process is governed by the interplay between the nanocrystal size and surface&#8208;coating ligand.








Abstract
The crystallization of nanocrystal building blocks into artificial superlattices has emerged as an efficient approach for tailoring the nanoscale properties and functionalities of novel devices. To date, ordered arrays of colloidal metal halide nanocrystals have mainly been achieved by using post&#8208;synthetic strategies. Here, a rapid and direct liquid&#8208;phase synthesis is presented to achieve a highly robust crystallization of luminescent metal halide nanocrystals into perfect face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) superlattices on the micrometer scale. The continuous growth of individual nanocrystals is observed within the superlattice, followed by the disassembly of the superlattices into individually dispersed nanocrystals owing to the highly repulsive interparticle interactions induced by large nanocrystals. Transmission electron microscopy characterization reveals that owing to an increase in solvent entropy, the structure of the superlattices transforms from FCC to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP) and the nanocrystals disassemble. The FCC superlattice exhibits a single and slightly redshifted emission, due to the reabsorption&#8208;free property of the building block units. Compared to individual nanocrystals, the superlattices have three times higher quantum yield with improved environmental stability, making them ideal for use as ultrabright blue&#8208;light emitters. This study is expected to facilitate the creation of metamaterials with ordered nanocrystal structures and their practical applications.

The concomitant nanocrystal growth and superlattice formation process is governed by the interplay between the nanocrystal size and surface-coating ligand.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crystallization of nanocrystal building blocks into artificial superlattices has emerged as an efficient approach for tailoring the nanoscale properties and functionalities of novel devices. To date, ordered arrays of colloidal metal halide nanocrystals have mainly been achieved by using post-synthetic strategies. Here, a rapid and direct liquid-phase synthesis is presented to achieve a highly robust crystallization of luminescent metal halide nanocrystals into perfect face-centered-cubic (FCC) superlattices on the micrometer scale. The continuous growth of individual nanocrystals is observed within the superlattice, followed by the disassembly of the superlattices into individually dispersed nanocrystals owing to the highly repulsive interparticle interactions induced by large nanocrystals. Transmission electron microscopy characterization reveals that owing to an increase in solvent entropy, the structure of the superlattices transforms from FCC to hexagonal close-packed (HCP) and the nanocrystals disassemble. The FCC superlattice exhibits a single and slightly redshifted emission, due to the reabsorption-free property of the building block units. Compared to individual nanocrystals, the superlattices have three times higher quantum yield with improved environmental stability, making them ideal for use as ultrabright blue-light emitters. This study is expected to facilitate the creation of metamaterials with ordered nanocrystal structures and their practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing the Fermi Level of a 3D Current Collector with Ni3S2/Ni3P Heterostructure for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical simulation, the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) with high work function is developed as a current collector for dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal anodes. The excellent electrochemical performance of Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na can be attributed to enhanced sodiophilicity, fast ion&#8208;transport kinetics, and uniform solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase structures.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium&#8208;metal batteries (RSMBs) with high energy density and low cost are attracting extensive attention as promising energy&#8208;storage technologies. However, the poor cyclability and safety issues caused by unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure and dendrite issues limit their practical application. Herein, it is theoretically predicted that constructing the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure with high work function can lower the Fermi energy level, and therefore effectively suppressing continuous electrolyte decomposition derived from the electron&#8208;tunneling effect after long&#8208;term sodiation process. Furthermore, the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) is experimentally fabricated as an advanced Na&#8208;anode current collector. The seamless Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure not only offers abundant active sites to induce uniform Na+ deposition and enhance ion&#8208;transport kinetics, but also facilitates the formation of stable SEI for dendrite&#8208;free sodium anode, which are confirmed by cryogenic components transmission electron microscopy tests and in situ spectroscopy characterization. As a result, the Na&#8208;composite anode (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na) delivers stable plating/stripping process of 5000 h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 2500 cycles. More impressively, the assembled sodium&#8208;ion full cell displays ultralong cycle life of 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 C. The strategy of stabilizing the sodium&#8208;metal anode gives fundamental insight into the potential construction of advanced RSMBs.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable FA&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by the Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Fluorophenylethanamine Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spacer cation of &#946;&#8208;fluorinated PEA (&#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA) is synthesized to enhance the efficiency and stability of FA&#8208;based 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The optimized 2D RP PSCs (&#12296;n&#12297;&#160;= 5) achieve a champion efficiency of 19.11% with largely improved stability by enhancing the quality and phase stability of the 2D RP perovskite film.








Abstract
2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2D RP) perovskite, with attractive environmental and structural stability, has shown great application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the relatively inferior photovoltaic efficiencies of 2D PSCs limit their further application. To address this issue, &#946;&#8208;&#8203;fluorophenylethanamine (&#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA) as a novel spacer cation is designed and employed to develop stable and efficient quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs. The strong dipole moment of the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA enhances&#160;the interactions between the cations and [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra, thus improving the charge dissociation of quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite. Additionally, the introduction of the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA cation optimizes&#160;the energy level alignment, improves&#160;the crystallinity, stabilizes&#160;both the mixed phase and a&#8208;FAPbI3 phase of the quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite film, prolongs&#160;the carrier diffusion length, increases&#160;the carrier lifetime and decreases&#160;the trap density. By incorporating the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA, the quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs exhibit&#160;a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.77% (vs phenylethylammonium (PEA)&#8208;based quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs of 12.81%) on PEDOT:PSS substrate and achieve&#160;a champion PCE of 19.11% on the PTAA substrate. It is worth noting that the unencapsulated &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA&#8208;based quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs exhibit&#160;considerably improved thermal and moisture stability. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing novel spacer cations for high&#8208;performance 2D RP PSCs.

         <title>Multivalent Nanobody Conjugate with Rigid, Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Scaffold for Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease</title>

A multivalent nanobody conjugate PNBIL incorporating a rigid, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging scaffold PDDA and engineered nanobody NBIL, whose third complementary&#8208;determining region is grafted by A&#946; 33&#8211;42 and C&#8208;terminus is fused with human IL&#8208;1&#946; 163&#8211;171, realizes the multi&#8208;target therapy of Alzheimer's disease through effectively suppressing A&#946; aggregation, promoting A&#946; plaque clearance, and eliminating ROS in the AD microenvironment.








Abstract
Efficient therapeutic strategies that concurrently target both A&#946; aggregation and oxidative stress in the Alzheimer's&#160;disease&#160;(AD)&#160;microenvironment emerge as a cutting&#8208;edge tool to combat the intricate pathogenesis of AD. Here, a multivalent nanobody conjugate with rigid, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging scaffold is developed to achieve simultaneous A&#946; amyloidogenesis mitigation, ROS elimination, and A&#946; plaque clearance. Grafting A&#946; segment (33&#8208;GLMVGGVVIA&#8208;42) into the third complementary&#8208;determining region of a parent nanobody generates an engineered nanobody NB that can recognize A&#946; and inhibit its aggregation through homotypic interactions. NB is further genetically modified with a fragment of human interleukin&#8208;1&#946; (163&#8208;VQGEESNDK&#8208;171), so that the obtained fusion nanobody NBIL can also facilitate the A&#946; clearance by microglia. Linking NBIL covalently onto a rigid, ROS scavenging scaffold poly(deca&#8208;4,6&#8208;diynedioic acid) (PDDA) creates the multivalent nanobody conjugate PNBIL, which not only boosts the binding affinity between NBIL and A&#946; aggregates for nearly 100 times but also possesses a long&#8208;term capability of oxidative stress alleviation, inflammation reduction, and neuron protection. PNBIL has significantly attenuated symptoms on two AD mouse models through amyloidogenesis inhibition and AD microenvironment modulation, validating that the multivalent nanobody conjugate design based on combinatory nanobody and molecular engineering is a promising approach of multi&#8208;target therapeutic strategies.

         <title>The transition from Elasto&#8208;Hydrodynamic to Mixed Regimes in Lubricated Friction of Soft Solid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lubrication regime transition from the elasto&#8208;hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL)&#160;regime to the mixed lubrication (ML) regime for soft solids can happen when the lubricant film thickness is much larger than the substrate surface roughness. During sliding, wave&#8208;like undulations are observed, accompanied by fingering instabilities at the trailing edge. These instabilities are closely related to the lubrication regime transition.








Abstract
Lubricated contacts in soft materials are common in various engineering and natural settings, such as tires, haptic applications, contact lenses, and the fabrication of soft electronic devices. Two major regimes are elasto&#8208;hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), in which solid surfaces are fully separated by a fluid film, and mixed lubrication (ML), in which there is partial solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid contact. The transition between these regimes governs the minimum sliding friction achievable and is thus very important. Generally, the transition from EHL to ML regimes is believed to occur when the thickness of the lubricant layer is comparable with the amplitude of surface roughness. Here, it is reported that in lubricated sliding experiments on smooth, soft, poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates, the transition can occur when the thickness of the liquid layer is much larger than the height of the asperities. Direct visualization of the &#8220;contact&#8221; region shows that the transition corresponds to the formation of wave&#8208;like surface wrinkles at the leading contact edge and associated instabilities at the trailing contact edge, which are believed to trigger the transition to the mixed regime. These results change the understanding of what governs the important EHL&#8211;ML transition in the lubricated sliding of soft solids.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Inspired Tri&#8208;State Photonic Crystal Composite Film for Multilevel Information Encryption and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the hindwing structure of the butterfly, a new kind of tri&#8208;state photonic crystal (PC) film is constructed by sophisticated anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials based on both chemical (luminescent materials) and physical structure units (3D&#160;PC structure), which supports three distinct optical states and makes counterfeiting almost impossible. Such system will be a promising next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;counterfeiting solution.








Abstract
Counterfeiting is a worldwide issue and has long troubled legitimate businesses, while nowadays anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials and technology are still insufficient to combat the escalating counterfeit behaviors. Inspired by hindwing structure of Troides magellanus, a new kind of anti&#8208;counterfeiting material taking advantage of both physical and chemical structures to display multiple optical states is prepared. The chemical units (luminescent lanthanide) are blended with physical units (monodispersed colloidal particles) and mediating molecules, which are then assembled into a photonic crystal structure at room temperature in less than 10&#160;s through a new assembly technique called molecule&#8208;mediated shear&#8208;induced assembly technique (MSAT). The as&#8208;prepared photonic crystal films feature three unique optical states, each displaying structural, fluorescent, and phosphorescent color under different lighting conditions, which integrates colors from both physical and chemical origins. Furthermore, by incorporating different luminescent materials into different parts of the photonic crystal pattern, a high&#8208;level information encryption system is designed to be capable of carrying three distinct types of information. Thanks to this powerful tool of MSAT, it is now possible to assemble different&#8208;sized, even irregular non&#8208;spherical units with monodispersed spherical units into high&#8208;quality photonic crystal films, which provides easy access to incorporating new features into photonic crystal systems.

         <title>Unveiling the Intrinsic Structure and Intragrain Defects of Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites by Ultralow Dose Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transmission&#8208;electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based characterization techniques are expected to play a significant role in revealing the structural, compositional, and electronic properties of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices. However, perovskites are unstable and highly sensitive to electron beam radiation. This paper has outlined key guidelines for imaging the intrinsic structure of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials.








Abstract
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful tool for unveiling the structural, compositional, and electronic properties of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) at the atomic to micrometer length scales. However, the structural and compositional instability of OIHPs under electron beam radiation results in misunderstandings of the microscopic structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationship in OIHP devices. Here, ultralow dose TEM is utilized to identify the mechanism of the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;induced changes in OHIPs and clarify the cumulative electron dose thresholds (critical dose) of different commercially interesting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OIHPs, including methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3, FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3, and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. The critical dose is related to the composition of the OIHPs, with FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3 having the highest critical dose of &#8776;84 e &#197;&#8722;2 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 having the lowest critical dose of &#8776;4.2 e &#197;&#8722;2. The electron beam irradiation results in the formation of a superstructure with ordered I and FA vacancies along &lt;110&gt;c, as identified from the three major crystal axes in cubic FAPbI3, &lt;100&gt;c, &lt;110&gt;c, and &lt;111&gt;c. The intragrain planar defects in FAPbI3 are stable, while an obvious modification is observed in FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 under continuous electron beam exposure. This information can serve as a guide for ensuring a reliable understanding of the microstructure of OIHP optoelectronic devices by TEM.

         <title>Terminal Atom&#8208;Controlled Etching of 2D&#8208;TMDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The terminal atom&#8208;controlled etching of 2D&#8208;TMDs through defects introduced by laser irradiationand subsequent thermal etching in a controlled etching atmosphere are presented. The forward etched hole arrays are etched in Ar/H2 atmosphere, the hexagonal hole arrays are etched in pure Ar atmosphere, and the reverse etched hole arrays are etched in Ar/sulfur vapor atmosphere.








Abstract
The controlled etching of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D&#8208;TMDs) is critical to understanding the growth mechanisms of 2D materials and patterning 2D materials but remains a major comprehensive challenge. Here, a rational strategy to control the terminal atoms of 2D&#8208;TMDs etched holes is reported. Using laser irradiation combined with an improved anisotropic thermal etching process under a determined atmosphere, terminal atom&#8208;controlled etched hole arrays are created on 2D&#8208;TMDs. By adjusting the gas atmosphere during the thermal etching stage, triangular etched hole arrays terminated by the tungsten&#160;zigzag&#160;(W&#8208;ZZ) edge (in an Ar/H2 atmosphere), hexagonal etched hole arrays terminated alternately by the W&#8208;ZZ edge and sulfur&#160;(selenium)&#160;zigzag&#160;(S&#8208;ZZ or&#160;Se&#8208;ZZ) edge (in a pure Ar atmosphere), and triangular etched hole arrays terminated by the S&#8208;ZZ (Se&#8208;ZZ) edge (in an Ar/sulfur [selenium] vapor atmosphere) can be obtained. Density functional theory reveals the forming energy of different edges and the different activities of metal atoms and chalcogenide atoms under different atmospheres, which determine the terminal atoms of the holes. This work may enhance the understanding of the etching and growth of 2D&#8208;TMDs. The 2D&#8208;TMDs hole arrays constructed by this work may have important applications in catalysis, nonlinear optics, spintronics, and large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.

         <title>Inhibited Crack Development by Compressive Strain in Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Mechanical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical behavior of perovskite films during thermal cycling is investigated and the mechanisms that guide the formation and development of microscopic cracks are revealed. An effective strategy to restrain the generation of cracks in perovskite films is further proposed by constructing a benign compressive strain perovskite film, leading to durable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising as next&#8208;generation photovoltaic materials, but stability issues are still a huge obstacle to their commercialization. Here, the formation and evolution of cracks in perovskite films during thermal cycling, which affect their mechanical stability, are investigated. Compressive strain is employed to suppress cracks and delamination by in situ formed polymers with low elastic modulus during crystal growth. The resultant devices pass the thermal&#8208;cycling qualification (IEC61215:2016), retaining 95% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) and compressive strain after 230 cycles. Meanwhile, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices deliver PCEs of 23.91% (0.0805 cm2) and 23.27% (1 cm2). The findings shed light on strain engineering with respect to their evolution, which enables mechanically stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Hierarchical Composite Self&#8208;Sorted Supramolecular Gel Noodles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent assembly of 2NapFF with the structurally similar functionalized dipeptide 2NapLG causes changes to the formed first&#8208;order supramolecular structures. These changes to assembly allow access to new properties and behaviors. This multicomponent system can be used to form mechanically robust supramolecular noodles. Through a change in external conditions (a reduction in pH), crystals can be formed within these noodles.








Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular systems can be used to achieve different properties and new behaviors compared to their corresponding single component systems. Here, a two&#8208;component system is used, showing that a non&#8208;gelling component modifies the assembly of the gelling component, allowing access to co&#8208;assembled structures that cannot be formed from the gelling component alone. The systems are characterized across multiple length scales, from the molecular level by NMR and CD spectroscopy to the microstructure level by SANS and finally to the material level using nanoindentation and rheology. By exploiting the enhanced mechanical properties achieved through addition of the second component, multicomponent noodles are formed with superior mechanical properties to those formed by the single&#8208;component system. Furthermore, the non&#8208;gelling component can be triggered to crystallize within the multicomponent noodles, allowing the preparation of new types of hierarchical composite noodles.

         <title>Enantioselective Au&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Thia[5]&#8208; and Thia[6]helicenes and Their Transformation into Bowl&#8208;shaped Pleiadenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective synthesis of three families of thiahelicenes is described, their inversion barriers determined, and their photochemical characterization reported. Upon acidic treatment of thia[6]helicenes these structures are wrapped into bowl&#8208;shaped pleiadenes with complete helical&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer.








Abstract
A series of helically shaped benzo[b]chryseno[4,3&#8208;d]thiophenes, naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]phenanthro[4,3&#8208;d]thiophenes, and chryseno[3,4&#8208;b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophenes is synthesized via a highly enantioselective Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation reaction. The inversion barriers of the structures obtained are determined both theoretically and experimentally, and their chiroptical properties are reported. Preliminary studies on the post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of these thiahelicenes and their transformation into azahelicenes are also presented. In addition, a straightforward one&#8208;step protocol is developed, which wraps the initially obtained chryseno[3,4&#8208;b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophenes into bowl&#8208;shaped pleiadene derivatives without erosion of the enantiopurity. The number of structurally related products that are obtained with high enantioselectivity enables the establishment of comprehensive correlations between the structure and conformational stability or (chir)optical properties.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Based Dexterous Artificial Motor Unit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under electrical stimulation, the actuation strain of the LCE&#8208;based motor unit can reach 45%, the strain rate is as high as 750%/s, and the output power density is as high as 1360&#160;W&#160;kg&#8208;1. It is further demonstrated that the LCE&#8208;based motor unit behaves more than an actuator and can be easily integrated into various artificial neuromuscular systems.








Abstract
Despite the great advancement in designing diverse soft robots, they are not yet as dexterous as animals in many aspects. One challenge is that they still lack the compact design of an artificial motor unit with a great comprehensive performance that can be conveniently fabricated, although many recently developed artificial muscles have shown excellent properties in one or two aspects. Herein, an artificial motor unit is developed based on gold&#8208;coated ultrathin liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) film. Subject to a voltage, Joule heating generated by the gold film increases the temperature of the LCE film underneath and causes it to contract. Due to the small thermal inertial and electrically controlling method of the ultrathin LCE structure, its cyclic actuation speed is fast and controllable. It is shown that under electrical stimulation, the actuation strain of the LCE&#8208;based motor unit reaches 45%, the strain rate reaches 750%/s, and the output power density is as high as 1360&#160;W&#160;kg&#8208;1. It is further demonstrated that the LCE&#8208;based motor unit behaves like an actuator, a brake, or a nonlinear spring on demand, analogous to most animal muscles. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, multiple highly dexterous artificial neuromuscular systems are demonstrated using the LCE&#8208;based motor unit.

         <title>Exploring Optimal Water Splitting Bifunctional Alloy Catalyst by Pareto Active Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, optimization process of bifunctional water splitting catalyst by the interplay of experiment and Pareto active learning is done to explore high&#8208;performance catalyst. Out of 77946 possible data points, only 110 experimental data points are enough to effectively develop the model, and the discovered catalyst shows high performance both for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Design of bifunctional multimetallic alloy catalysts, which are one of the most promising candidates for water splitting, is a significant issue for the efficient production of renewable energy. Owing to large dimensions of the components and composition of multimetallic alloys, as well as the trade&#8208;off behavior in terms of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials for bifunctional catalysts, it is difficult to search for high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts with multimetallic alloys using conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experiments. Here, an optimal bifunctional catalyst for water splitting is obtained by combining Pareto active learning and experiments, where 110 experimental data points out of 77946 possible points lead to effective model development. The as&#8208;obtained bifunctional catalysts for HER and OER exhibit high performance, which is revealed by model development using Pareto active learning; among the catalysts, an optimal catalyst (Pt0.15Pd0.30Ru0.30Cu0.25) exhibits a water splitting behavior of 1.56 V at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This study opens avenues for the efficient exploration of multimetallic alloys, which can be applied in multifunctional catalysts as well as in other applications.

         <title>3D Printing of Electron/Ion&#8208;Flux Dual&#8208;Gradient Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>

A 3D&#8208;printed Zn anode with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Ag nanoparticles (3DP&#8208;BU@Zn) establishes dual&#8208;gradient electron/ion fluxes and realizes an extremely small voltage hysteresis and a superior lifespan over 630 h. This unique dual&#8208;gradient strategy sheds light on the roadmap for the next&#8208;generation safe and durable Zn&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
3D porous Zn&#8208;metal anodes have aroused widespread interest&#160;for Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Nevertheless, the notorious &#8220;top&#8208;growth&#8221; dendrites caused by the intrinsic top&#8208;concentrated ions and randomly distributed electrons may ultimately trigger a cell failure. Herein, an electron/ion&#8208;flux dual&#8208;gradient 3D porous Zn anode is reported&#160;for dendrite&#8208;free ZIBs by adopting 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed Zn anode with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Ag nanoparticles (3DP&#8208;BU@Zn) establishes dual&#8208;gradient electron/ion fluxes, i.e., an internal bottom&#8208;up gradient electron flux created by bottom&#8208;rich conductive Ag nanoparticles, and a gradient ion flux resulting from zincophilic Ag nanoparticles which pump ions toward the bottom. Meanwhile, the 3D&#8208;printing&#8208;enabled hierarchical porous structure and continuously conducting network endow unimpeded electron transfer and ion diffusion among the electrode, dominating a bottom&#8208;preferential Zn deposition behavior. As a result, the 3DP&#8208;BU@Zn symmetrical cell affords highly reversible Zn plating/stripping with an extremely small voltage hysteresis of 17.7&#160;mV and a superior lifespan over 630 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the 3DP&#8208;BU@Zn//VO2 full cell exhibits remarkable cyclic stability over 500 cycles. This unique dual&#8208;gradient strategy sheds light on the roadmap for the next&#8208;generation safe and durable Zn&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;Based Ingestible Impedance Sensor to Evaluate Gastrointestinal Epithelial Barriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin film electrode arrays are integrated with gelatin&#8208;based substrates to fabricate ingestible impedance sensing arrays. These devices are evaluated on their ability to monitor gastrointestinal barrier integrity, an indicator of several gut&#8208;related diseases. In vitro, theoretical, and ex vivo techniques are presented to test the viability of this sensing approach.








Abstract
Low&#8208;profile and transient ingestible electronic capsules for diagnostics and therapeutics can replace widely used yet invasive procedures such as endoscopies. Several gastrointestinal diseases such as reflux disease, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis result in increased intercellular dilation in epithelial barriers. Currently, the primary method of diagnosing and monitoring epithelial barrier integrity is via endoscopic tissue biopsies followed by histological imaging. Here, a gelatin&#8208;based ingestible electronic capsule that can monitor epithelial barriers via electrochemical impedance measurements is proposed. Toward this end, material&#8208;specific transfer printing methodologies to manufacture soft&#8208;gelatin&#8208;based electronics, an in vitro synthetic disease model to validate impedance&#8208;based sensing, and tests of capsules using ex vivo using porcine esophageal tissue are described. The technologies described herein can advance next generation of oral diagnostic devices that reduce invasiveness and improve convenience for patients.

         <title>Improved Liquid Collection on a Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Superhydrophilic Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the shell&#8208;like superhydrophilic 3D channels, here a spontaneous, directional, adaptive, and gravity&#8208;independent fluid collecting process is realized. The further integration of a radiative layer can improve steam collection, proving a potential application in water reusage.








Abstract
Manipulating fluid with an open channel provides a promising strategy to simplify the current systems. Nevertheless, spontaneous on&#8208;surface fluid transport with large flux, high speed, and long distance remains challenging. Inspired by scallop shells, here a shell&#8208;like superhydrophilic origami (S&#8208;SLO) with multiple&#8208;paratactic and dual&#8208;asymmetric channels is presented to improve fluid collection. The origami channel can capture various types of liquids, including droplets, flow, and steam, and then transport collected liquid unidirectionally. The S&#8208;SLO with 2&#160;mm depth can reach maximum flux of 450&#160;mL&#160;h&#8722;1, which is five times the capacity of a flat patterned surface with similar dimension. To diversify the function of such interface, the SLO is further integrated with a superhydrophobic zirconium carbide/silicone coating for enhanced condensation via the collaboration of directional fluid manipulation and a radiative cooling layer. Compared with the unmodified parallel origami, the shell&#8208;like origami with a radiative cooling layer shows a 56% improvement in condensate efficiency as well as the directional liquid drainage. This work demonstrates a more accessible design for the optimization of on&#8208;surface fluid control, and the improved performance of liquid transport should extend the applications of bioinspired fluid&#8208;manipulating interfaces.

Contour plot displays the magnitude of the conventional topological Hall effect (THE), revealing that it is particularly strong up to room temperature. Inset: Lorentz&#8208;TEM image from an area of the sample collected at T&#160;= 100 K, highlighting the coexistence of magnetic domains having in&#8208;plane oriented spins that yield merons (green shaded regions) with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ones (purple shaded regions) where skyrmions are observed under a magnetic field.








Fe5&#8211;xGeTe2 is a centrosymmetric, layered van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet that displays Curie temperatures Tc (270&#8211;330 K) that are within the useful range for spintronic applications. However, little is known about the interplay between its topological spin textures (e.g., merons, skyrmions) with technologically relevant transport properties such as the topological Hall effect (THE) or topological thermal transport. Here, via high&#8208;resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that merons and anti&#8208;meron pairs coexist with N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe5&#8211;xGeTe2 over a wide range of temperatures and probe their effects on thermal and electrical transport. A THE is detected, even at room T, that senses merons at higher T's, as well as their coexistence with skyrmions as T is lowered, indicating an on&#8208;demand thermally driven formation of either type of spin texture. Remarkably, an unconventional THE is also observed in absence of Lorentz force, and it is attributed to the interaction between charge carriers and magnetic field&#8208;induced chiral spin textures. These results expose Fe5&#8211;xGeTe2 as a promising candidate for the development of applications in skyrmionics/meronics due to the interplay between distinct but coexisting topological magnetic textures and unconventional transport of charge/heat carriers.

         <title>Restoration of Sinusoid Fenestrae Followed by Targeted Nanoassembly Delivery of an Anti&#8208;Fibrotic Agent Improves Treatment Efficacy in Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver fibrosis is accompanied by the capillarization of liver sinusoid endothelial cells, which decreases the accessibility of therapeutics in the blood to hepatic stellate cells in the Disse space. A combinational strategy of sinusoid fenestrae restoration followed by HSC&#8208;targeted delivery of an anti&#8208;fibrotic agent is developed for liver fibrosis treatment. The strategy ameliorates fibrosis in the liver fibrosis murine models.








Abstract
During the onset of liver fibrosis, capillarized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) limit substance exchange between the blood and the Disse space, further accelerating hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) activation and fibrosis progression. Limited accessibility of therapeutics to the Disse space is often overlooked and remains a major bottleneck for HSCs&#8208;targeted therapy in liver fibrosis. Here, an integrated systemic strategy for liver fibrosis treatment is reported, utilizing pretreatment with the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, riociguat, followed by insulin growth factor 2 receptor&#8208;mediated targeted delivery of the anti&#8208;fibrosis agent, JQ1, via peptide&#8208;nanoparticles (IGNP&#8208;JQ1). The riociguat reversed the liver sinusoid capillarization to maintain a relatively normal LSECs porosity, thus facilitating the transport of IGNP&#8208;JQ1 through the liver sinusoid endothelium wall and enhancing the accumulation of IGNP&#8208;JQ1 in the Disse space. IGNP&#8208;JQ1 is then selectively taken up by activated HSCs, inhibiting their proliferation and decreasing collagen deposition in the liver. The combined strategy results in significant fibrosis resolution in carbon tetrachloride&#8208;induced fibrotic mice as well as methionine&#8208;choline&#8208;deficient&#8208;diet&#8208;induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice. The work highlights the key role of LSECs in therapeutics transport through the liver sinusoid. The strategy of restoring LSECs fenestrae by riociguat represents a promising approach for liver fibrosis treatment.

         <title>Organic Synthetic Photonic Systems with Reconfigurable Parity&#8211;Time Symmetry Breaking for Tunable Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic photonic material system with reconfigurable parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry breaking is proposed theoretically and realized experimentally. The composite system of functional organic molecules is deliberately designed and processed into reconfigurable PT symmetric microcavities. The molecular photoisomerization process reconfigures the PT symmetry breaking in the organic microcavity system, allowing for a record&#8208;breaking tunable single&#8208;mode laser performance.








Abstract
Synthetic photonic materials exploiting the quantum concept of parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry lead to an emerging photonic paradigm&#8212;non&#8208;Hermitian photonics, which is revolutionizing the photonic sciences. The non&#8208;Hermitian photonics dealing with the interplay between gain and loss in PT synthetic photonic material systems offers a versatile platform for advancing microlaser technology. However, current PT&#8208;symmetric microcavity laser systems only manipulate imaginary parts of the refractive indices, suffering from limited laser spectral bandwidth. Here, an organic composite material system is proposed to synthesize reconfigurable PT&#8208;symmetric microcavities with controllable complex refractive indices for realizing tunable single&#8208;mode laser outputs. A grayscale electron&#8208;beam direct&#8208;writing technique is elaborately designed to process laser dye&#8208;doped polymer films in one single step into microdisk cavities with periodic gain and loss distribution, which enables thresholdless PT&#8208;symmetry breaking and single&#8208;mode laser operation. Furthermore, organic photoisomerizable compounds are introduced to reconfigure the PT&#8208;symmetric systems in real&#8208;time by tailoring the real refractive index of the polymer microresonators, allowing for a dynamically and continuously tunable single&#8208;mode laser output. This work fundamentally enhances the PT&#8208;symmetric photonic systems for innovative design of synthetic photonic materials and architectures.

         <title>Record&#8208;High Electron Mobility Exceeding 16 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in Bisisoindigo&#8208;Based Polymer Semiconductor with a Fully Locked Conjugated Backbone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel donor&#8722;acceptor copolymers, PNFFN&#8208;DTE and PNFFN&#8208;FDTE, are developed with a partially or a fully locked conjugated backbone, respectively. Flexible polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) based on PNFFN&#8208;FDTE exhibit ambipolar transport characteristic under ambient conditions with the maximum electron mobility of 16.67 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest electron&#8208;transport performance for PFETs reported to date.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors with mobilities exceeding 10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, especially ambipolar and n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors, are still rare, although they are of great importance for fabricating polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) toward commercial high&#8208;grade electronics. Herein, two novel donor&#8722;acceptor copolymers, PNFFN&#8208;DTE and PNFFN&#8208;FDTE, are designed and synthesized based on the electron&#8208;deficient bisisoindigo (NFFN) and electron&#8208;rich dithienylethylenes (DTE or FDTE). The copolymer PNFFN&#8208;DTE, containing NFFN and DTE, possesses a partially locked polymeric conjugated backbone, whereas PNFFN&#8208;FDTE, containing NFFN and FDTE, has a fully locked one. Fluorine atoms in FDTE not only induce the formation of additional CH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;F hydrogen bonds, but also lower frontier molecular orbitals for PNFFN&#8208;FDTE. Both PNFFN&#8208;DTE and PNFFN&#8208;FDTE form more ordered molecular packing in thin films prepared from a polymer solution in bicomponent solvent containing 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene (DCB) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (with volume ratio of 99.2/0.8) than pure DCB. The two copolymers&#8208;based flexible PFETs exhibit ambipolar charge&#8208;transport properties. Notably, the bicomponent solvent&#8208;processed PNFFN&#8208;FDTE&#8208;based PFETs afford a high electron mobility of 16.67 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest electron&#8208;transport mobility for PFETs reported so far. The high electron mobility of PNFFN&#8208;FDTE is attributed to its fully locked conjugated backbone, dense molecular packing, and much matched LUMO energy level.

         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Brushes&#8221;:&#160;Organic Vapors Influence Water Contact Angles on Hydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mean contact angle and contact angle hysteresis of water are investigated on different hydrophobic surfaces with different organic vapors. The results show that soluble vapors influence contact angles primarily by reducing the interfacial energies while a in water&#8208;insoluble vapors, e.g. toluene vapor, surfaces can be lubricated.








Abstract
Fast removal of water drops from solid surfaces is important in many applications such as on solar panels in rain, in heat transfer, and for water collection. Recently, a reduction in lateral adhesion of water drops on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brush surfaces after exposure to various organic vapors&#160;was&#160;reported. It&#160;was&#160;attributed to the physisorption of vapor and swelling of the PDMS brushes. However, it&#160;was&#160;later pointed out that a change in the interfacial energies by vapor adsorption could also have caused low drop adhesion. To find out how strongly each&#160;effect contributes, contact angles of water drops on three hydrophobic surfaces in different vapors are measured. In water&#8208;soluble vapors, a substantial decrease is observed in contact angles. This decrease can indeed be explained by a vapor&#8208;induced change in the interfacial tensions. The very low contact angle hysteresis on PDMS surfaces in saturated n&#8208;hexane and toluene vapor cannot be explained by a change in interfacial tensions. The observation supports the hypothesis that these vapors adsorb into the PDMS and form a lubricating layer. It is hoped that these findings help to solve fundamental problems and contribute to applications, such as anti&#8208;icing, heat transfer, and water collection.

Metasurface&#8208;generated multicolor and three&#8208;dimensional holography is demonstrated using single&#8208;cell metasurfaces. By using an inverse design based on gradient&#8208;descent optimization, multiple pieces of holographic information are encoded into a single&#8208;cell metasurface. The designed single&#8208;cell metasurfaces demonstrate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art data capacity of a phase&#8208;only metasurface. The inverse&#8208;designed single&#8208;cell metasurfaces are experimentally realized using a high&#8208;throughput nanoimprint lithography fabrication method.








Metasurface&#8208;generated holography has emerged as a promising route for fully reproducing vivid scenes by manipulating the optical properties of light using ultra&#8208;compact devices. However, achieving multiple holographic images using a single metasurface is still difficult due to the capacity limit of a single meta&#8208;atom. In this work, an inverse design method based on gradient&#8208;descent optimization is presented to encode multiple pieces of holographic information into a single metasurface. The proposed method allows the inverse design of single&#8208;cell metasurfaces without the need for complex meta&#8208;atom design strategies, facilitating high&#8208;throughput fabrication using broadband low&#8208;loss materials. By exploiting the proposed design method, both multiplane red&#8208;green&#8208;blue&#160;(RGB)&#160;color&#160;and three&#8208;dimensional&#160;(3D) holograms are designed and experimentally demonstrated. Multiplane RGB color holograms with nine distinct holograms are achieved, which demonstrate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art data capacity of a phase&#8208;only metasurface. The first experimental demonstration of metasurface&#8208;generated 3D holograms with completely independent and distinct images in each plane is also presented. The current research findings provide a viable route for practical metasurface&#8208;generated holography by demonstrating the high&#8208;density holography produced by a single metasurface. It is expected to ultimately lead to optical storage, display, and full&#8208;color imaging&#160;applications.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloys/materials are attracting significant attention in materials science, where the higher entropy facilitates the formation of solid&#8208;solution phases. In this work, a general strategy is reported to enhance the solubility of specific salts in liquid electrolytes&#160;by introducing multiple salts to form a high&#8208;entropy solution that assists in stabilizing the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases, that changes the solvation interactions, which can be used to improve battery performances.








Abstract
Developing liquid electrolytes with higher kinetics and enhanced interphase stability is one of the key challenges for lithium batteries. However, the poor solubility of lithium salts in solvents sets constraints that compromises the electrolyte properties. Here, it is shown that introducing multiple salts to form a high&#8208;entropy solution, alters the solvation structure, which can be used to raise the solubility of specific salts and stabilize electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases. The prepared high&#8208;entropy electrolytes significantly enhance the cycling and rate performance of lithium batteries. For lithium&#8208;metal anodes the reversibility exceeds 99%, which extends the cycle life of batteries even under aggressive cycling conditions. For commercial batteries, combining a graphite anode with a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode, more than 1000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles are achieved while maintaining a capacity retention of more than 90%. These performance improvements with respect to regular electrolytes are rationalized by the unique features of the solvation structure in high&#8208;entropy electrolytes. The weaker solvation interaction induced by the higher disorder results in improved lithium&#8208;ion kinetics, and the altered solvation composition leads to stabilized interphases. Finally, the high&#8208;entropy, induced by the presence of multiple salts, enables a decrease in melting temperature of the electrolytes and thus enables lower battery operation temperatures without changing the solvents.

         <title>Effects of Multiple Ion Reactions Based on a CoSe2/MXene Cathode in Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aluminum&#8208;ion cathode material based on an array&#160;of&#160;MXene lamellar CoSe2 nanoparticles is designed and synthesized. The lattice distortion brought by the AlCl4&#8722; ion embedding has a serious impact on the initial stability of the battery, and such distortion consumes extra energy, making it difficult for the Coulombic efficiency to reach close to 100%.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (RAIBs) have emerged as a promising battery storage technology owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, operational safety, and high energy density. However, their actual capacity is substantially lower than their true capacity and their cycling stability is poor. Therefore, understanding the energy&#8208;storage mechanism may contribute to the successful design of a stable electrode material, on which the performance can be optimized. The aim of this study is to investigate AlCl4&#8722; ions in transition metal cathode materials and mechanisms that enable for their high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage potential and low Coulombic efficiency. Results of theoretical analysis and experimental verification show that a multi&#8208;ion transport mechanism is responsible for the electrochemical behavior of the battery. The lattice distortion of CoSe2 caused by AlCl4&#8722; ion intercalation, has a considerable effect on the initial stability of the battery. MXene as a support material reduces the size of CoSe2 growing on its surface, effectively inhibiting the lattice distortion caused by the interaction with the aluminum&#8208;anion complex, thus addressing the issues of poor reversibility, cycle instability, and low Coulombic efficiency of the battery. Hence, understanding the impact of MXene on the battery may aid in further improving the design of electrode materials.

A series of terpolymers are developed by introducing the B&#63743;N bond into the polymer chain of PM6, which lowers the HOMO level, reduces the &#916;EST, and optimizes the morphology of the active blend, contributing to a high PCE of 19.02% with reduced Eloss and charge recombination.








Abstract
Suppressing the photon energy loss (Eloss), especially the non&#8208;radiative loss, is of importance to further improve the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, typical &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess a large singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), leading to a lower triplet state than charge transfer state and contributing to a non&#8208;radiative loss channel of the photocurrent by the triplet state. Herein, a series of triplet polymer donors are developed by introducing a BNIDT block into the PM6 polymer backbone. The high electron affinity of BNIDT and the opposite resonance effect of the B&#63743;N bond in BNIDT results in a lowered highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and a largely reduced &#916;EST. Moreover, the morphology of the active blends is also optimized by fine&#8208;tuning the BNIDT content. Therefore, non&#8208;radiative recombination via the terminal triplet loss channels and morphology traps is effectively suppressed. The PNB&#8208;3 (with 3% BNIDT):L8&#8208;BO device exhibits both small &#916;EST and optimized morphology, favoring more efficient charge transfer and transport. Finally, the simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.907&#160;V, Jsc of 26.59&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and FF of 78.86% contribute to a champion PCE of 19.02%. Therefore, introducing B&#63743;N bonds into benchmark polymers is a possible avenue toward higher&#8208;performance of OSCs.

         <title>Comment on &#8220;Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Brushes&#8221;: Vapor Alteration Alone Reduces Water Droplet Adhesion</title>

Abstract
A reduction in lateral adhesion of water droplets on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brush surfaces exposed to various vapor conditions&#160;was&#160;recently reported. It&#160;was&#160;suggested that the mobility of droplets is due to swelling of the PDMS brushes. When changing the vapor surrounding sliding droplets on bare surfaces, a similar phenomenon is observed, presenting a much simpler explanation of the observed results.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2207787, Can Yang Zhang, Wei Tao, and co&#8208;workers review the recent advances in living&#8208;leukocyte&#8208;mediated drug delivery. Due to the targeted response to the inflammatory environment, leukocytes (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) have great potential as targeted carriers for drug delivery and are expected to bring breakthroughs in the precise treatment of cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

2D Magnets
In article number 2212087, Luis Balicas and co&#8208;workers investigate topological spin structures detected in Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2, or the coexistence of planar spin vortices containing merons at their center with skyrmions. Their simulations reveal that the coexistence of merons with skymions originates from regions of in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy, respectively.

Double Perovskites
In article number 2209759, Zheng Deng, Martha Greenblatt, Changqing Jin, and co&#8208;workers report that a cooling field of a few Oersteds can generate a giant exchange bias like effect in a double perovskite, Y2NiIrO6. This fascinating bias effect is attributed to the pinned magnetic domains due to the combination of strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling on Ir, and antiferromagnetically coupled Ni&#8208; and Ir&#8208;sublattices.

Bioinspired Interfaces
Bioinspired fluid transporting interfaces provide a promising strategy to simplify the current systems. In article number 2211596, Moyuan Cao and co&#8208;workers present superhydrophilic origami with dual&#8208;asymmetric channels to realize a spontaneous, unidirectional, adaptive, and gravity&#8208;independent fluid&#8208;collection process. The further integration of a radiative layer can improve fog and steam collection, proving a potential application in water reusage.

         <title>Living Leukocyte&#8208;Based Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since leukocytes actively participate in cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases, leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems have attracted much attention in recent years. Herein, recent progress and future perspectives in macrophage&#8208;, neutrophil&#8208;, and lymphocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems, as well as their combination with other treatments (immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and photodynamic therapy) are reviewed, highlighting promising drug delivery strategies to treat cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Leukocytes play a vital role in immune responses, including defending against invasive pathogens, reconstructing impaired tissue, and maintaining immune homeostasis. When the immune system is activated in vivo, leukocytes accomplish a series of orderly and complex regulatory processes. While cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases like sepsis are critical medical difficulties plaguing humankind around the world, leukocytes have been shown to largely gather at the focal site,&#160;and significantly contribute to&#160;inflammation and cancer progression. Therefore, the living leukocyte&#8208;based&#160;drug delivery systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to the innate and specific targeting effect, low immunogenicity, improved therapeutic efficacy, and low reverse effect. In this review, the recent advances in the development of living leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems including macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes as promising treatment strategies for cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases are introduced. The advantages, current challenges, and limitations of these delivery systems are also discussed, as well as perspectives on the future development of precision and targeted therapy in the clinics are provided. Collectively, it is expected that such kind of living cell&#8208;based drug delivery system is promising to improve or even revolutionize the treatments of cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases in the clinics.

         <title>Polaritons in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of 2D material polaritons in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is reviewed from the perspective of design principles and potential applications. Some fundamental properties of polaritons in vdWHs are initially discussed, followed by recent discoveries of plasmons, phonon polaritons, exciton polaritons, and their hybrid modes in vdWHs.








Abstract
2D monolayers supporting a wide variety of highly confined plasmons, phonon polaritons, and exciton polaritons can be vertically stacked in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with controlled constituent layers, stacking sequence, and even twist angles. vdWHs combine advantages of 2D material polaritons, rich optical structure design, and atomic scale integration, which have greatly extended the performance and functions of polaritons, such as wide frequency range, long lifetime, ultrafast all&#8208;optical modulation, and photonic crystals for nanoscale light. Here, the state of the art of 2D material polaritons in vdWHs from the perspective of design principles and potential applications is reviewed. Some fundamental properties of polaritons in vdWHs are initially discussed, followed by recent discoveries of plasmons, phonon polaritons, exciton polaritons, and their hybrid modes in vdWHs. The review concludes with a perspective discussion on potential applications of these polaritons such as nanophotonic integrated circuits, which will benefit from the intersection between nanophotonics and materials science.

         <title>An Advanced Strategy to Enhance TENG Output: Reducing Triboelectric Charge Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 17, April 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains difficult in technology to enhance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) output performance if only promoting the triboelectric charge generation, because the optimal TENG output performance is theoretically decided by the dynamic equilibrium during vitally triboelectric charge between generation and decay. To break this bottleneck, this review outlines the strategy of reducing triboelectric charge decay to enhance TENG output.








Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to accelerate the construction of smart cities. However, it requires more than 30 billion sensors to realize the IoT vision, posing great challenges and opportunities for industries of self&#8208;powered sensors. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), an emerging new technology, is capable of easily converting energy from surrounding environment into electricity, thus TENG has tremendous application potential in self&#8208;powered IoT sensors. At present, TENG encounters a bottleneck to boost output for large&#8208;scale commercial use if just by promoting triboelectric charge generation, because the output is decided by the triboelectric charge dynamic equilibrium between generation and decay. To break this bottleneck, the strategy of reducing triboelectric charge decay to enhance TENG output is focused. First, multiple mechanisms of triboelectric charge decay are summarized in detail with basic theoretical principles for future research. Furthermore, recent advances in reducing triboelectric charge decay are thoroughly reviewed and outlined in three aspects: inhibition and application of air breakdown, simultaneous inhibition of air breakdown and triboelectric charge drift/diffusion, and inhibition of triboelectric charge drift/diffusion. Finally, challenges and future research focus are proposed. This review provides reference and guidance for enhancing TENG output.

         <title>Data Class&#8208;Specific All&#8208;Optical Transformations and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Diffractive optical networks provide rich opportunities for visual computing tasks since the spatial information of a scene can be directly accessed by a diffractive processor without requiring any digital pre&#8208;processing steps. Here we present data class&#8208;specific transformations all&#8208;optically performed between the input and output fields&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOVs) of a diffractive network. The visual information of the objects is encoded into the amplitude (A), phase (P), or intensity (I) of the optical field at the input, which is all&#8208;optically processed by a data class&#8208;specific diffractive network. At the output, an image sensor&#8208;array directly measures the transformed patterns, all&#8208;optically encrypted using the transformation matrices pre&#8208;assigned to different data classes, i.e., a separate matrix for each data class. The original input images can be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse transformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any other key will lead to loss of information. The class&#8208;specificity of these all&#8208;optical diffractive transformations creates opportunities where different keys can be distributed to different users; each user can only decode the acquired images of only one data class, serving multiple users in an all&#8208;optically encrypted manner. We numerically demonstrated all&#8208;optical class&#8208;specific transformations covering A &#8594; A, I &#8594; I, and P &#8594; I transformations using various image datasets. We also experimentally validated the feasibility of this framework by fabricating class&#8208;specific I &#8594; I transformation diffractive networks and successfully tested them at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., 1550 nm and 0.75 mm wavelengths. Data class&#8208;specific all&#8208;optical transformations provide a fast and energy&#8208;efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.

&lt;p&gt;Diffractive optical networks provide rich opportunities for visual computing tasks since the spatial information of a scene can be directly accessed by a diffractive processor without requiring any digital pre-processing steps. Here we present data class-specific transformations all-optically performed between the input and output fields-of-view (FOVs) of a diffractive network. The visual information of the objects is encoded into the amplitude (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;), phase (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;), or intensity (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;) of the optical field at the input, which is all-optically processed by a data class-specific diffractive network. At the output, an image sensor-array directly measures the transformed patterns, all-optically encrypted using the transformation matrices pre-assigned to different data classes, i.e., a separate matrix for each data class. The original input images can be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse transformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any other key will lead to loss of information. The class-specificity of these all-optical diffractive transformations creates opportunities where different keys can be distributed to different users; each user can only decode the acquired images of only one data class, serving multiple users in an all-optically encrypted manner.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Small Molecule Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Symmetric&#8208;Asymmetric Alloy Acceptor with a Broad Composition Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and stable ternary system by introducing a new asymmetric electron acceptor SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system is developed, which exhibits a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.02% and demonstrates better operational stability as compared to the host system.








Abstract
Using a combinatory blending strategy is demonstrated as a promising path for designing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by boosting the short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;small molecule OSC (all&#8208;SMOSCs) using a narrow&#8208;bandgap alloy acceptor containing symmetric and asymmetric molecules (BTP&#8208;eC9 and SSe&#8208;NIC) and a wide&#8208;bandgap small molecule donor MPhS&#8208;C2 is reported. Introducing the synthesized SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system can broaden the absorption spectrum, modulate energy offsets, and optimize the molecular packing of the host materials. After systematically optimizing the weight ratio of MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9:SSe&#8208;NIC, a champion efficiency of 18.02% is achieved. Impressively, the ternary system not only delivered a broad composition tolerance with device efficiencies over 17% throughout the whole blend ratios, but also exhibited less non&#8208;geminate recombination and energy loss, and better&#8208;light&#8208;soaking stability than the corresponding binary systems. This work promotes the development of high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;SMOSCs and heralds their brighter application prospects.

         <title>Target&#8208;Driven Design of Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Materials via Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target&#8208;driven materials design framework combining high&#8208;throughput calculations, crystal structure prediction, and machine learning is proposed to accelerate the discovery of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. The machine learning regression model for predicting birefringence is developed for the first time. As&#160;an application, eight compounds with promising NLO&#8208;related properties which show potential applications in the deep&#8208;UV region are identified.








Abstract
The development of a data&#8208;driven science paradigm is greatly revolutionizing the process of materials discovery. Particularly, exploring novel nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with the birefringent phase&#8208;matching ability to deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) region is of vital significance for the field of laser technologies. Herein, a target&#8208;driven materials design framework combining high&#8208;throughput calculations (HTC), crystal structure prediction, and interpretable machine learning (ML) is proposed to accelerate the discovery of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. Using a dataset generated from HTC, an ML regression model for predicting birefringence is developed for the first time, which exhibits a possibility of achieving fast and accurate prediction. Essentially, crystal structures are adopted as the only known input of this model to establish a close structure&#8208;property relationship mapping birefringence. Utilizing the ML&#8208;predicted birefringence which can affect the shortest phase&#8208;matching wavelength, a full list of potential chemical compositions based on an efficient screening strategy is identified. Further, eight structures with good stability are discovered to show potential applications in the deep&#8208;UV region, owing to their promising NLO&#8208;related properties. This study provides a new insight into the discovery of NLO materials and this design framework can identify desired materials with high performances in the broad chemical space at a low computational cost.

         <title>A Liquid Triboelectric Series</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid triboelectric series is first established to describe the triboelectric properties of each liquid when contact electrification occurs with a solid surface. Common chemical groups can be derived that hydroxyl groups enhance, and benzene groups suppress the liquid triboelectric effect. This study may thus provide new perspectives on the applications of the liquid triboelectric effect.








Abstract
The triboelectric series is a generally accepted method for describing the triboelectric effect. It provides a way to control the double face of the ubiquitous triboelectric effect: causes of unpredictable accidents and the resultant surface charge as energy sources. However, previous studies have been biased in solids despite being observed in liquids (liquid&#8208;solid contact electrification). Therefore, a liquid triboelectric series is necessary to be established to manipulate the liquid triboelectric effect according to the appropriate goal. In this study, a liquid triboelectric series is first established to describe the triboelectric properties of each liquid when contact electrification occurs with a solid surface. The liquid triboelectric series covers electrolytes, organic solvents, oxidants, and higher sugar alcohols. Common chemical groups can be derived from the liquid triboelectric series that hydroxyl groups enhance, and benzene groups suppress the liquid triboelectric effect. The results are demonstrated by the amplified efficiency of an energy harvester and particle contamination after surface washing. This study will play a pivotal role in understanding the liquid&#8208;solid contact electrification phenomenon and providing new perspectives on the applications of the liquid triboelectric effect.

         <title>Brightening Blue Photoluminescence in Nonemission MOF&#8208;2 by Pressure Treatment Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Initially nonemission MOF&#8208;2 shows a conspicuous pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) with bright blue&#8208;light within 7.0&#160;GPa, and the excellent PIE is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4%. The hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect effectively elevates the rotational barrier of the linker rotors by pressure treatment engineering, which turns on the photoluminescence in MOF&#8208;2.








Abstract
As equally essential as the synthesis of new materials, maneuvering new structure configurations can endow the brand&#8208;new functional properties to existing materials, which is also one of the core goals in the synthesis community. In this respect, pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) that triggers photoluminescence (PL) in nonemission materials is an emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials technology. In the PIE paradigms, harvesting bright PL at ambient conditions, however, has remained elusive. Herein, a remarkable PIE phenomenon is reported in initially nonemission Zn(BDC)(DMF)(H2O) (MOF&#8208;2), which shows bright blue&#8208;emission at 455&#160;nm under pressure. Intriguingly, the bright blue PL with an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4% is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions upon decompression from 16.2&#160;GPa. The detailed structural analyses combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect elevates powerfully the rotational barrier of the linker rotor to 3.87&#160;eV mol&#8722;1 from initial 0.91&#160;eV mol&#8722;1 through pressure treatment. The downgrade rotational freedom turns on PL of MOF&#8208;2 after releasing pressure completely. This is the first case of harvesting PIE to ambient conditions. These findings offer a new platform for the creation of promising alternatives to high&#8208;performance PL materials based on initially nonemission counterparts.

         <title>Bifunctional Ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;Alloy Nanowire Electrocatalysts for Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowire electrocatalysts are designed and synthesized via a facile solvothermal method, demonstrating excellent performance for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and offering an attractive electrocatalyst system for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis without ammonia as a byproduct.








Abstract
Hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers a feasible path for low&#8208;voltage green hydrogen production. Herein, the design and synthesis of ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowires as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. It is shown that the RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowires can achieve complete electrooxidation of hydrazine with a low overpotential and high mass activity, as well as improved performance for the HER. The resulting RhRu0.5 bifunctional electrocatalysts enable, high performance hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis delivering a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow cell voltage of 54 mV and a high current density of 853&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The RhRu0.5&#160;electrocatalysts further demonstrate a stable operation at a high current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 80 hours of testing period with little irreversible degradation. The overall performance greatly&#160;exceeds that of the previously reported hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolyzers, offering a pathway for efficiently converting hazardous hydrazine into molecular hydrogen.

Herein, the design and synthesis of ultrathin RhRu&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;-alloy wavy nanowires as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. It is shown that the RhRu&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;-alloy wavy nanowires can achieve complete electrooxidation of hydrazine with a low overpotential and high mass activity, as well as improved performance for the HER. The resulting RhRu&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; bifunctional electrocatalysts enable, high performance hydrazine-assisted water electrolysis delivering a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an ultralow cell voltage of 54 mV and a high current density of 853&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The RhRu&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;electrocatalysts further demonstrate a stable operation at a high current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 80 hours of testing period with little irreversible degradation. The overall performance greatly&#160;exceeds that of the previously reported hydrazine-assisted water electrolyzers, offering a pathway for efficiently converting hazardous hydrazine into molecular hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Doped Heterointerfaced Ru/RuSe2 Nanosheets with Optimized H and H2O Adsorption Boost Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is designed and synthesized. The superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterogeneous interface structure and Cu doping, which leads to the optimized H and H2O adsorption to boost hydrogen evolution catalysis.








Abstract
Ruthenium chalcogenide is a highly promising catalytic system as a Pt alternative for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, well&#8208;studied ruthenium selenide (RuSe2) still exhibits sluggish HER kinetics in alkaline media due to the inappropriate adsorption strength of H and H2O. Herein, xx report a new design of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets (NSs) with optimized H and H2O adsorption strength for highly efficient HER catalysis in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterointerfaced structure and Cu doping, which not only optimizes the electronic structure with a suitable d&#8208;band center to suppress proton overbinding but also alleviates the energy barrier with enhanced H2O adsorption. As a result, Cu&#8208;doped heterogeneous Ru/RuSe2 NSs exhibit a small overpotential of 23&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 58.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.88 s&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mV for HER in alkaline media, which is among the best catalysts in noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward HER. The present Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 NSs interface catalyst is very stable for HER by showing no activity decay after 5000&#8208;cycle potential sweeps. This work heralds that heterogeneous interface modulation opens up a new strategy for the designing of more efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organization of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticles into Complex Multicompartment Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeS2 NPs self&#8208;assemble into biomimetic supraparticles with multiple interconnected compartments. High complexity of the particles manifests in their functionality. They successfully encapsulate nucleic acid cargo, deliver it inside the cells, and protect it against degradation in the environment.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled compartments from nanoscale components are found in all life forms. Their characteristic dimensions are in 50&#8211;1000&#160;nm scale, typically assembled from a variety of bioorganic &#8220;building blocks&#8221;. Among the various functions that these mesoscale compartments carry out, protection of the content from the environment is central. Finding synthetic pathways to similarly complex and functional particles from technologically friendly inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is needed for a multitude of biomedical, biochemical, and biotechnological processes. Here, it is shown that FeS2 NPs stabilized by l&#8208;cysteine self&#8208;assemble into multicompartment supraparticles (mSPs). The NPs initially produce &#8776;55&#160;nm concave assemblies that reconfigure into &#8776;75&#160;nm closed mSPs with &#8776;340 interconnected compartments with an average size of &#8776;5&#160;nm. The intercompartmental partitions and mSP surface are formed primarily from FeS2 and Fe2O3 NPs, respectively. The intermediate formation of cup&#8208;like particles enables encapsulation of biological cargo. This capability is demonstrated by loading mSPs with DNA and subsequent transfection of mammalian cells. Also it is found&#160;that the temperature stability of the DNA cargo is enhanced compared to the traditional delivery vehicles. These findings demonstrate that biomimetic compartmentalized particles can be used to successfully encapsulate and enhance temperature stability of the nucleic acid cargo for a variety of bioapplications.

         <title>Full Site&#8208;Specific Addressability in DNA Origami&#8208;Templated Silica Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami&#8208;templated silica nanostructures combine the excellent properties of both materials resulting in a new type of nanostructure with the precise programmability of DNA origami and the mechanical and structural resilience of silica. It is here shown that these structures also retain one of the most attractive features of DNA origami: complete site&#8208;specific addressability for guest molecule placement after silicification.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology allows for the fabrication of nanometer&#8208;sized objects with high precision and selective addressability as a result of the programmable hybridization of complementary DNA strands. Such structures can template the formation of other materials, including metals and complex silica nanostructures, where the silica shell simultaneously acts to protect the DNA from external detrimental factors. However, the formation of silica nanostructures with site&#8208;specific addressability has thus far not been explored. Here, it is shown that silica nanostructures templated by DNA origami remain addressable for post silicification modification with guest molecules even if the silica shell measures several nm in thickness. The conjugation of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides is used to different silicified DNA origami structures carrying a complementary ssDNA handle as well as DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution imaging to show that ssDNA handles remain unsilicified and thus ensure retained addressability. It is also demonstrated that not only handles, but also ssDNA scaffold segments within a DNA origami nanostructure remain accessible, allowing for the formation of dynamic silica nanostructures. Finally, the power of this approach is demonstrated by forming 3D DNA origami crystals from silicified monomers. These results thus present a fully site&#8208;specifically addressable silica nanostructure with complete control over size and shape.

         <title>Novel Organic Superbase Dopants for Ultraefficient N&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of two organic superbase dopants as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the dopants lead to record&#8208;high conductivity in doped N2200 and PC61BM films, and exhibit particularly high polaron generation efficiency and doping efficiency. A possible deprotonation&#8208;induced nucleophilic&#8208;attack n&#8208;doping mechanism is suggested for the organic superbase dopants.








Abstract
Doping is a powerful technique for engineering the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs), yet efficient n&#8208;doping of OSCs remains a central challenge. Herein, the discovery of two organic superbase dopants, namely P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu and P4&#8208;t&#8208;Bu as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. Typical n&#8208;type semiconductors such as N2200 and PC61BM are shown to experience a significant increase of conductivity upon doping by the two dopants. In particular, the optimized electrical conductivity of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped PC61BM reaches a record&#8208;high value of 2.64&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The polaron generation efficiency of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped in PC61BM is found to be over 35%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of benchmark n&#8208;dopant N&#8208;DMBI. In addition, a deprotonation&#8208;initiated, nucleophilic&#8208;attack&#8208;based n&#8208;doping mechanism is proposed for the organic superbases, which involves the deprotonation of OSC molecules, the nucleophilic attack of the resulting carbanions on the OSC's &#960;&#8208;bonds, and the subsequent n&#8208;doping through single electron transfer process between the anionized and neutral OSCs. This work highlights organic superbases as promising n&#8208;dopants for OSCs and opens up opportunities to explore and develop highly efficient n&#8208;dopants.

         <title>Colorful Electrochromic Displays with High Visual Quality Based on Porous Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy that is structured around a new type of porous metamaterial is developed to circumvent the critical problem in electrochromic displays, which offers personalized devices that exhibit non&#8208;iridescent and large viewable angles, fast switching responses, excellent cycling performance, and extremely low power consumption.








Abstract
The introduction of metamaterials into electrochromic (EC) displays has recently inspired a great breakthrough in the EC field, as this can offer a variety of new attractive features, from a very wide gamut of colors to very fast switching times. However, such metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays still face significant constraints when developing from single electrodes to full devices, because other supportive&#160;components in devices, such as counter electrodes and electrolytes, significantly affect light propagation and the subsequent perceived color quality in metamaterial&#8208;based EC devices. Herein, a new, cost&#8208;effective device design structured around a new type of porous metamaterial is reported to circumvent the critical problem in metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays. Owing to its unique design, the metamaterial&#8208;based EC device achieves good color quality with no drop in brightness or shift in color chromaticity when compared with a single electrode. Moreover, the porous&#8208;metamaterial&#8208;based EC device can exhibit non&#8208;iridescence and be viewed from a wide range of angles (5&#176;&#8211;85&#176;) and has fast switching response (2.4 and 2.5 s for coloration and bleaching, respectively), excellent cycling performance (at least 2000 cycles), and extremely low power consumption (4.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Metal Ion Strategy for Carbon Materials Derived from Cobalt Benzimidazole Frameworks with High Desalination Performance in Simulated Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metal ions (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) with different valence states are confined in the quasi&#8208;microcube shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks (CoZIF9) using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. A series of derived carbon materials with limited metal ions are obtained through high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis and applied in capacitive deionization.








Abstract
Various metal ions with different valence states (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) are successfully confined in quasi&#8208;microcube shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. More importantly, a series of derived carbon materials that confine metal ions are obtained by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Interestingly, the derived carbon materials exhibited electric double&#8208;layer and pseudocapacitance properties because of the presence of metal ions with various valence states. Moreover, the presence of additional metal ions within carbon materials may create new phases, which can accelerate Na+ insertion/extraction and thus increase electrochemical adsorption. Density functional theory results showed that carbon materials in which Ti ions are confined exhibit enhanced insertion/extraction of Na+ resulting from the presence of the characteristic anatase crystalline phases of TiO2. The Ti&#8208;containing materials have an impressive desalination capacity (62.8&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) in capacitive deionization (CDI) applications with high cycling stability. This work provides a facile synthetic strategy for the confinement of metal ions in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and thus supports the further development of derived carbon materials for seawater desalination by CDI.

         <title>Confined Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Mediated Cation Diffusion through Layered Membranes for High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion transport in random stacked laminar graphene oxide (GO) membrane suffers from limited mass transport brought by insufficient wetting. The pre&#8208;addition of ionic liquids (ILs) in the layer spacing provides a continuous medium for fast ion transport, greatly solving this problem. Meanwhile, nanoconfinement between the charged GO nanosheets promotes the dissociation of ILs and rearrangement, bringing in additional space charges for the osmotic energy conversion.








Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes act as the core components in osmotic energy harvesting, but remain with deficiencies such as low ion selectivity and a tendency to swell. 2D nanofluidic membranes as competitive candidates are still subjected to limited mass transport brought by insufficient wetting and poor stability in water. Here, an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused graphene oxide (GO@IL) membrane with ultrafast ion transport ability is reported, and how the confined ionic liquid mediates selective cation diffusion is revealed. The infusion of ionic liquids endows the 2D membrane with excellent mechanical strength, anti&#8208;swelling properties, and good stability in aqueous electrolytes. Importantly, immiscible ionic liquids also provide a medium, allowing partial dehydration for ultrafast ion transport. Through molecular dynamics simulation and finite element modeling, that GO nanosheets induce ionic liquids to rearrange, bringing in additional space charges, which can be coupled with GO synergistically, is proved. By mixing 0.5/0.01&#160;m NaCl solution, the power density can achieve a record value of &#8776;6.7&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;art GO&#8208;based membranes. This work opens up a new route for boosting nanofluidic energy conversion because of the diversity of the ILs and 2D materials.

         <title>Molecular Sensitization Enabled High Performance Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new material design concept is developed for the preparation of high performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillation materials via low&#8208;temperature processes. With metal halides as X&#8208;ray sensitizer and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) organic cations as emitter, a single crystalline 0D organic metal halide hybrid ((TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4) is discovered to exhibit radioluminescence with an absolute light yield of 14,700 &#177; 800 Photons/MeV and a short decay lifetime of 9.96&#160;ns.








Abstract
Scintillators, one of the essential components in medical imaging and security checking devices, rely heavily on rare&#8208;earth&#8208;containing inorganic materials. Here, a new type of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillators containing earth abundant elements that can be prepared via low&#8208;temperature processes is reported. With room temperature co&#8208;crystallization of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) organic halide, 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino) phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(propyl)&#8208;pyrindin&#8208;1ium bromide (TPA&#8208;PBr), and a metal halide, zinc bromide (ZnBr2), a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D)&#160;organic metal halide hybrid (TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4 with a yellowish&#8208;green emission peaked at 550&#160;nm has been developed. In this hybrid material, dramatically enhanced X&#8208;ray scintillation of TPA&#8208;P+ is achieved via the sensitization by ZnBr42&#8722;. The absolute light yield (14,700&#160;&#177;&#160;800 Photons/MeV) of (TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4 is found to be higher than that of anthracene (&#8776;13,500 Photons/MeV), a well&#8208;known organic scintillator, while its X&#8208;ray absorption is comparable to those of inorganic scintillators. With TPA&#8208;P+ as an emitting center, short photoluminescence and radioluminescence decay lifetimes of 3.56 and 9.96&#160;ns have been achieved. Taking the advantages of high X&#8208;ray absorption of metal halides and efficient radioluminescence with short decay lifetimes of organic cations, the material design paves a new pathway to address the issues of low X&#8208;ray absorption of organic scintillators and long decay lifetimes of inorganic scintillators simultaneously.

         <title>Selective Methionine Pool Exhaustion Mediated by a Sequential Positioned MOF Nanotransformer for Intense Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer cells are addictive to exogenous methionine to gear toward tumor proliferation. Meanwhile, they could replenish methionine pool from polyamine metabolism through methionine salvage pathway. However, the current developed therapeutic tactics for methionine depletion remain facing great challenges in terms of the selectivity, safety and efficiency. Herein, a sequential positioned metal organic framework (MOF) nanotransformer was designed to selectively exhaust methionine pool via inhibiting the uptake of methionine and throttling its salvage pathway for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The MOF nanotransformer could restrain the open source and reduce the reflux of methionine to exhaust methionine pool of cancer cells. Moreover, the intracellular traffic routes of sequential positioned MOF nanotransformer matched well with the distribution of polyamines, which was conducive to the oxidation of polyamines via its responsive deformability and nanozyme&#8208;augmented Fenton&#8208;like reaction for the final exhaustion of intracellular methionine. Our results verified that the well&#8208;designed platform could not only kill cancer cells efficiently but also promote the infiltration of CD8 and CD4 T cells for intensive cancer immunotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will inspire the construction of novel MOF&#8208;based antineoplastic platform and provide new insights into the development of metabolic&#8208;related immunotherapy.

         <title>Trehalose&#8208;Guanosine Glycopolymer Hydrogels Direct Adaptive Glia Responses in CNS Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neural tissue damaged after central nervous system (CNS) injury does not naturally regenerate but is instead replaced by non&#8208;neural fibrotic scar tissue that serves no neurological function. Scar&#8208;free repair to create a more permissive environment for regeneration requires altering the natural injury responses of glial cells. In this work, glycopolymer&#8208;based supramolecular hydrogels are synthesized to direct adaptive glia repair after CNS injury. Combining poly(trehalose&#8208;co&#8208;guanosine) (pTreGuo) glycopolymers with free guanosine (fGuo) generates shear thinning hydrogels through stabilized formation of long&#8208;range G&#8208;quadruplex secondary structures. Hydrogels with smooth or granular microstructures and mechanical properties spanning three orders of magnitude are produced through facile control of pTreGuo hydrogel composition. Injection of pTreGuo hydrogels into healthy mouse brain elicits minimal stromal cell infiltration and peripherally derived inflammation that is comparable to a bioinert methyl cellulose benchmarking material. pTreGuo hydrogels alter astrocyte borders and recruit microglia to infiltrate and resorb the hydrogel bulk over 7 days. Injections of pTreGuo hydrogels into ischemic stroke alter the natural responses of glial cells after injury to reduce the size of lesions and increase axon regrowth into lesion core environments. These results support the use of pTreGuo hydrogels as part of neural regeneration strategies to activate endogenous glia repair mechanisms.

         <title>Immunostimulatory DNA Hydrogel Enhances Protective Efficacy of Nanotoxoids against Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While vaccines have been highly successful in protecting against various infections, there are still many high&#8208;priority pathogens for which there are no clinically approved formulations. To overcome this challenge, researchers have explored the use of nanoparticulate strategies for more effective antigen delivery to the immune system. Along these lines, nanotoxoids are a promising biomimetic platform that leverage cell membrane coating technology to safely deliver otherwise toxic bacterial antigens in their native form for antivirulence vaccination. Here, in order to further boost their immunogenicity, we embed nanotoxoids formulated against staphylococcal &#945;&#8208;hemolysin into a DNA&#8208;based hydrogel with immunostimulatory CpG motifs. The resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite is injectable and improves the in vivo delivery of vaccine antigens while simultaneously stimulating nearby immune cells. This leads to elevated antibody production and stronger antigen&#8208;specific cellular immune responses. In murine models of pneumonia and skin infection caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), mice vaccinated with the hybrid vaccine formulation are well protected. This work highlights the benefits of combining nanoparticulate antigen delivery systems with immunostimulatory hydrogels into a single platform, and the approach can be readily generalized to a wide range of infectious diseases.

         <title>Coexistence of Both Localized Electronic States and Electron Gas at Rutile TiO2 Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Localized electron polarons formed by the coupling of excess electrons and ionic vibrations play a key role in the functionalities of materials. However, the mechanism of the coexistence of delocalized electrons and localized polarons remains underexplored. Here, we report the discovery of high&#8208;mobility two&#8208;dimensional electron gas at the rutile TiO2 surface through argon ion irradiation&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies. Strikingly, the electron gas forms electron polarons at lower temperatures, resulting in an abrupt metal&#8208;insulator transition. Moreover, we find that the low&#8208;temperature conductivity in the insulating state is dominated by excess free electrons with a high mobility of &#8764;103 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, whereas the carrier density is dramatically suppressed with decreasing temperature. Remarkably, we reveal that the application of an electric field can lead to a collapse of the localized states, resulting in a metallic state. These results reveal the strongly correlated/coupled nature between the localized electrons and high mobility electrons and offer a new pathway to probe and harvest the exotic electron state at the complex oxide surfaces.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials&#8208;based in situ cancer vaccines can generate endogenous antigens directly from tumors and fully exploit the generated tumor antigens to elicit potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and antitumor efficacy. An overview of biomaterials&#8208;based in situ cancer vaccines is presented, either living or artificial materials, under development or in the clinic.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapies have reshaped the paradigm for cancer treatment over the past decade. Among them, therapeutic cancer vaccines that aim to modulate antigen&#8208;presenting cells and subsequent T cell priming processes are among the first FDA&#8208;approved cancer immunotherapies. However, despite showing benign safety profiles and the capability to generate antigen&#8208;specific humoral and cellular responses, cancer vaccines have been limited by the modest therapeutic efficacy, especially for immunologically cold solid tumors. One key challenge lies in the identification of tumor&#8208;specific antigens, which involves a costly and lengthy process of tumor cell isolation, DNA/RNA extraction, sequencing, mutation analysis, epitope prediction, peptide synthesis, and antigen screening. To address these issues, in situ cancer vaccines have been actively pursued to generate endogenous antigens directly from tumors and utilize the generated tumor antigens to elicit potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Biomaterials&#8208;based in situ cancer vaccines, in particular, have achieved significant progress by taking advantage of biomaterials that can synergize antigens and adjuvants, troubleshoot delivery issues, home, and manipulate immune cells in situ. This review will provide an overview of biomaterials&#8208;based in situ cancer vaccines, either living or artificial materials, under development or in the clinic, and discuss the design criteria for in situ cancer vaccines.

         <title>An Organic Chiroptical Detector Favoring Circularly Polarized Light Detection from Near&#8208;Infrared to Ultraviolet and Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Amplifying Dissymmetry in Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized light detection has attracted growing attention due to the great applications in optical communication and biological detection. Organic chiroptical detectors with circularly polarized light detection ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared are fabricated successfully. Furthermore, the external magnetic field can increase the factor of dissymmetry in electric current from 0.18 to 0.23 at room temperature.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light detection has attracted growing attention because of its unique application in security surveillance and quantum optics. Here, through designing a chiral polymer as a donor, a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized light detector is fabricated, successfully enabling detection from ultraviolet (300&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1100&#160;nm). The chiroptical detector presents an excellent ability to distinguish right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light, where dissymmetries in detectivity, responsivity, and electric current are obtained and then optimized. The dissymmetry in electric current can be increased from 0.18 to 0.23 once an external magnetic field is applied. This is a very rare report on the dissymmetry tunability by an external field in chiroptical detectors. Moreover, the chirality&#8208;generated orbital angular momentum is one of the key factors determining the performance of the circularly polarized light detection. Overall, the organic chiroptical detector presents excellent stability in detection, which provides great potential for future flexible and compact integrated platforms.

         <title>Heterologous Assembly of Pleomorphic Bacterial Microcompartment Shell Architectures Spanning the Nano&#8208; to Microscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling shell proteins derived from bacterial microcompartments are a promising new biomaterial with applications in drug delivery, metabolic engineering, cell&#8208;free synthesis, and bioelectronics. A synthetic platform produces pleomorphic shells spanning the nano&#8208; to microscale that are rapidly purified. Geometric models of new morphologies suggest shared design principles with asymmetric carbon and viral protein analogs.








Abstract
Many bacteria use protein&#8208;based organelles known as bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) to organize and sequester sequential enzymatic reactions. Regardless of their specialized metabolic function, all BMCs are delimited by a shell made of multiple structurally redundant, yet functionally diverse, hexameric (BMC&#8208;H), pseudohexameric/trimeric (BMC&#8208;T), or pentameric (BMC&#8208;P) shell protein paralogs. When expressed without their native cargo, shell proteins have been shown to self&#8208;assemble into 2D sheets, open&#8208;ended nanotubes, and closed shells of &#8776;40&#160;nm diameter that are being developed as scaffolds and nanocontainers for applications in biotechnology. Here, by leveraging a strategy for affinity&#8208;based purification, it is demonstrated that a wide range of empty synthetic shells, many differing in end&#8208;cap structures, can be derived from a glycyl radical enzyme&#8208;associated microcompartment. The range of pleomorphic shells observed, which span &#8776;2 orders of magnitude in size from &#8776;25&#160;nm to &#8776;1.8&#160;&#181;m, reveal the remarkable plasticity of BMC&#8208;based biomaterials. In addition, new capped nanotube and nanocone morphologies are observed that are consistent with a multicomponent geometric model in which architectural principles are shared among asymmetric carbon, viral protein, and BMC&#8208;based structures.

         <title>Bi&#8208;Deficiency Leading to High&#8208;Performance in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation and tuning of complex defects can effectively enhance the thermoelectric performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This work proposes an approach to mitigate the negative scattering effect of Mg vacancies by Bi deficiency. The heterovalent vacancies provide a strong phonon scattering, leading to a significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity and a superior zT.








Abstract
Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 is a potential nearly&#8208;room temperature thermoelectric compound composed of earth&#8208;abundant elements. However, complex defect tuning and exceptional microstructural control are required. Prior studies have confirmed the detrimental effect of Mg vacancies (VMg) in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This study proposes an approach to mitigating the negative scattering effect of VMg by Bi deficiency, synergistically modulating the electrical and thermal transport properties to enhance the thermoelectric performance. Positron annihilation spectrometry and Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that the VMg tends to coalesce due to the introduced Bi vacancies (VBi). The defects created by Bi deficiency effectively weaken the scattering of electrons from the intrinsic VMg and enhance phonon scattering. A peak zT of 1.82 at 773 K and high conversion efficiency of 11.3% at &#8710;T = 473 K are achieved in the optimized composition of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 by tuning the defect combination. This work demonstrates a feasible and effective approach to improving the performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 as an emerging thermoelectric material.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based (PPr) Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells with Stability Over 6000&#160;h</title>

         <dc:description>
A new series of hydrophobic conducting polymers containing pyrrolopyrrole (PPr) and thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) moieties is designed and synthesized to serve as hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells to attain a power conversion efficiency of 7.6% with shelf&#8208;storage stability over 6000 h, which opens a new avenue for future development of non&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) HTMs with great performance and stability.








Abstract
A new set of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based (PPr) polymers incorporated with thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) is synthesized and explored as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) for Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Three bithiophenyl spacers bearing the thioalkylated hexyl (SBT&#8208;6), thioalkylated tetradecyl (SBT&#8208;14), and tetradecyl (BT&#8208;14) chains are utilized to examine the effect of the alkyl chain lengths. Among them, the TPSCs are fabricated using PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 as HTMs through a two&#8208;step approach by attaining a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.6% with a remarkable long&#8208;term stability beyond 6000 h, which has not been reported elsewhere for a non&#8208;PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based TPSC. The PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device is stable under light irradiation for 5 h in air (50% relative humidity) at the maximum power point (MPP). The highly planar structure, strong intramolecular S(alkyl)&#183;&#183;&#183;S(thiophene) interactions, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of SBT enable the PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device to outperform the standard poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene,&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl (P3HT) and other devices. The longer thio&#8208;tetradecyl chain in SBT&#8208;14 restricts molecular rotation and strongly affects the molecular conformation, solubility, and film wettability over other polymers. Thus, the present study makes a promising dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTM model for the future design of highly efficient and stable TPSCs.

         <title>Fill in the Blank: Transferrable Deep Learning Approaches to Recover Missing Physical Field Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tackling with engineering problems requires filling in missing information and translation from limited data input to understand complex material behaviors. This study provides a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based method to complete mechanical fields given part of the domain, further identify the internal composite microstructures, and solve the inverse problem in an efficient way, which overcomes the difficulty conventional approaches are faced with.








Abstract
Solving materials engineering tasks is often hindered by limited information, such as in inverse problems with only boundary data information or design tasks with a simple objective but a vast search space. To address these challenges, multiple deep learning (DL) architectures are leveraged to predict missing mechanical information given limited known data in part of the domain, and further characterize the composite geometries from the recovered mechanical fields for 2D and 3D complex microstructures. In 2D, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is utilized to complete partially masked field maps and predict the composite geometry with convolutional models with great accuracy and generality by making precise predictions on field data with mixed stress/strain components, hierarchical geometries, distinct materials properties and various types of microstructures including ill&#8208;posed inverse problems. In 3D, a Transformer&#8208;based architecture is implemented to predict complete 3D mechanical fields from input field snapshots. The model manifests excellent performance regardless of microstructural complexity and recovers the entire bulk field even from a single surface field image, allowing internal structural characterization from only boundary measurements. The whole frameworks provide efficient ways for analysis and design with incomplete information and allow the direct inverse translation from properties back to materials structures.

         <title>Pyroptosis&#8208;Mediated Synergistic Photodynamic and Photothermal Immunotherapy Enabled by a Tumor&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Targeted Photosensitive Dimer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;targeted photosensitive dimer, which effectively generates type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species in hypoxic tumor tissue for pyroptosis&#8208;mediated photoimmunotherapy, is successfully developed. Its remarkable photothermal properties accelerate the pyroptosis process, increase DNA damage in tumor cells, generate drastic immunogenic cell death and systemic antitumor immune response, and prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis.








Abstract
Overcoming the resistance to apoptosis and immunosuppression of tumor cells is a significant challenge in augmenting the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic programmed cell&#8208;death pathway unlike apoptosis, is considered a type of immunogenic cell death (ICD) that can intensify the ICD process in tumor cells, releasing dramatically increased tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns to promote cancer immunotherapy. Herein, a tumor cell membrane&#8208;targeted aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitive dimer is found to be able to achieve highly efficient ICD under the synergistic effect of photodynamic and photothermal therapy. The photosensitive dimer can efficiently produce type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) by photodynamic therapy in hypoxic tumor tissue, leading to pyroptosis by direct cell membrane damage, which is further reinforced by its photothermal effect. Furthermore, the enhanced ICD effect based on the dimer can completely eliminate the primary tumor on the seventh day of treatment and can also boost systemic antitumor immunity by generating immune memory, which is demonstrated by the superior antitumor therapeutic effects on both solid tumors and metastatic tumors when healing 4T1 tumor mouse models with poor immunogenicity.

&lt;p&gt;A membrane-targeted photosensitive dimer, which effectively generates type-I reactive oxygen species in hypoxic tumor tissue for pyroptosis-mediated photoimmunotherapy, is successfully developed. Its remarkable photothermal properties accelerate the pyroptosis process, increase DNA damage in tumor cells, generate drastic immunogenic cell death and systemic antitumor immune response, and prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming the resistance to apoptosis and immunosuppression of tumor cells is a significant challenge in augmenting the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic programmed cell-death pathway unlike apoptosis, is considered a type of immunogenic cell death (ICD) that can intensify the ICD process in tumor cells, releasing dramatically increased tumor-associated antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns to promote cancer immunotherapy. Herein, a tumor cell membrane-targeted aggregation-induced emission photosensitive dimer is found to be able to achieve highly efficient ICD under the synergistic effect of photodynamic and photothermal therapy. The photosensitive dimer can efficiently produce type-I reactive oxygen species (ROS) by photodynamic therapy in hypoxic tumor tissue, leading to pyroptosis by direct cell membrane damage, which is further reinforced by its photothermal effect. Furthermore, the enhanced ICD effect based on the dimer can completely eliminate the primary tumor on the seventh day of treatment and can also boost systemic antitumor immunity by generating immune memory, which is demonstrated by the superior antitumor therapeutic effects on both solid tumors and metastatic tumors when healing 4T1 tumor mouse models with poor immunogenicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activatable Graphene Quantum&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based Nanotransformers for Long&#8208;Period Tumor Imaging and Repeated Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanovehicle, a quantum dot nanotransformes, smartly transforms its shape in tumor acidic microenvironment to prolong the tumor retention, and then disassembles and releases the encapsulated photosensitizers to &#8220;turn on&#8221; the imaging contrast. The total drug dose in repeated photodynamic therapy is reduced because one injection is enough for four times of light irradiation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as an emerging therapeutic modality against cancer with high spatiotemporal selectivity because the utilized photosensitizers (PSs) are only active and toxic upon light irradiation. To maximize its effectiveness, PDT is usually applied repetitively for ablating various tumors. However, the total overdose of PSs from repeated administrations causes severe side effects. Herein, acidity&#8208;activated graphene quantum dots&#8208;based nanotransformers (GQD NT) are developed as PS vehicles for long&#8208;period tumor imaging and repeated PDT. Under the guidance of Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp peptide, GQD NT targets to tumor tissues actively, and then loosens and enlarges in tumor acidity, thus promising long tumor retention. Afterwards, GQD NT transforms into small pieces for better penetration in tumor. Upon laser irradiation, GQD NT generates mild hyperthermia that enhances cell membrane permeability and further promotes the PSs uptake. Most intriguingly, the as&#8208;prepared GQD NT not only &#8220;turns&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence/magnetic resonance signals, but also achieves efficient repeated PDT. Notably, the total PSs dose is reduced to 3.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1, which is 10&#8211;30&#160;times lower than that of other reported works. Overall, this study exploits a smart vehicle to enhance accumulation, retention, and release of PSs in tumors through programmed deformation, thus overcoming the overdose obstacle in repeated PDT.

         <title>siRNA Delivery against Myocardial Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Mediated by Reversibly Camouflaged Biomimetic Nanocomplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomplexes (NCs) based on membrane&#8208;penetrating helical polypeptide and reversible, platelet&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) cloaking are developed for efficient siSav1 delivery against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. HM coating drives the targeted accumulation of NCs in the injured myocardium, and acid&#8208;triggered membrane shedding allows efficient delivery of siSav1 into cardiomyocytes, which suppresses the Hippo pathway and induces cardiomyocyte regeneration.








Abstract
siRNA&#8208;mediated management of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is greatly hampered by the inefficient myocardial enrichment and cardiomyocyte transfection. Herein, nanocomplexes (NCs) reversibly camouflaged with a platelet&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) are developed to efficiently deliver Sav1 siRNA (siSav1) into cardiomyocytes, suppressing the Hippo pathway and inducing cardiomyocyte regeneration. The biomimetic BSPC@HM NCs consist of a cationic nanocore assembled from a membrane&#8208;penetrating helical polypeptide (P&#8208;Ben) and siSav1, a charge&#8208;reversal intermediate layer of poly(l&#8208;lysine)&#8208;cis&#8208;aconitic acid (PC), and an outer shell of HM. Due to HM&#8208;mediated inflammation homing and microthrombus targeting, intravenously injected BSPC@HM NCs can efficiently accumulate in the IR&#8208;injured myocardium, where the acidic inflammatory microenvironment triggers charge reversal of PC to shed off both HM and PC layers and allow the penetration of the exposed P&#8208;Ben/siSav1 NCs into cardiomyocytes. In rats and pigs, BSPC@HM NCs remarkably downregulates Sav1 in IR&#8208;injured myocardium, promotes myocardium regeneration, suppresses myocardial apoptosis, and recovers cardiac functions. This study reports a bioinspired strategy to overcome the multiple systemic barriers against myocardial siRNA delivery, and holds profound potential for gene therapy against cardiac injuries.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Scale Understanding of Misorientation Toughening in Corals and Seashells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coral skeletons and nacre (left and right, respectively) have distinct structures, but they share slight misorientation of adjacent crystals, as displayed in these maps where color represents crystal orientation, and as measured in the histogram (center bottom). Synthetic spherulites, center top, spontaneously self&#8208;assemble with slight misorientation of adjacent crystals.








Abstract
Biominerals are organic&#8211;mineral composites formed by living organisms. They are the hardest and toughest tissues in those organisms, are often polycrystalline, and their mesostructure (which includes nano&#8208; and microscale crystallite size, shape, arrangement, and orientation) can vary dramatically. Marine biominerals may be aragonite, vaterite, or calcite, all calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs, differing in crystal structure. Unexpectedly, diverse CaCO3 biominerals such as coral skeletons and nacre share a similar characteristic: Adjacent crystals are slightly misoriented. This observation is documented quantitatively at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales, using polarization&#8208;dependent imaging contrast mapping (PIC mapping), and the slight misorientations is consistently between 1&#176; and 40&#176;. Nanoindentation shows that both polycrystalline biominerals and abiotic synthetic spherulites are tougher than single&#8208;crystalline geologic aragonite, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bicrystals at the molecular scale reveals that aragonite, vaterite, and calcite exhibit toughness maxima when the bicrystals are misoriented by 10&#176;, 20&#176;, and 30&#176;, respectively, demonstrating that slight misorientation alone can increase fracture toughness. Slight&#8208;misorientation&#8208;toughening can be harnessed for synthesis of bioinspired materials that only require one material, are not limited to specific top&#8208;down architecture, and are easily achieved by self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules (e.g., aspirin, chocolate), polymers, metals, and ceramics well beyond biominerals.

         <title>Localized Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of miR&#8208;29b Normalizes the Dysregulation of Bone Homeostasis Caused by Osteosarcoma whilst Simultaneously Inhibiting Tumor Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles is developed that is delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy and to study the potential of attenuating tumor growth whilst normalizing bone homeostasis. It is found that when miR&#8208;29b is delivered, compared to chemotherapy alone, the therapy provided a significant decrease in tumor burden, an increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis caused by the tumor.








Abstract
Patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma undergo extensive surgical intervention and chemotherapy resulting in dismal prognosis and compromised quality of life owing to poor bone regeneration, which is further compromised with chemotherapy delivery. This study aims to investigate if localized delivery of miR&#8208;29b&#8212;which is shown to promote bone formation by inducing osteoblast differentiation and also to suppress prostate and cervical&#160;tumor growth&#8212;can suppress osteosarcoma tumors whilst simultaneously normalizing the dysregulation of bone homeostasis caused by osteosarcoma. Thus, the therapeutic potential of microRNA (miR)&#8208;29b is studied to promote bone remodeling in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma (rather than in bone defect models using healthy mice), and in the context of chemotherapy, that is clinically relevant. A formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles are developed that are delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy and to study the potential of attenuating tumor growth whilst normalizing bone homeostasis. It is found that when miR&#8208;29b is delivered along with systemic chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone, the therapy provided a significant decrease in tumor burden, an increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis thereby normalizing the dysregulation of bone lysis activity caused by the tumor.

         <title>Slimming and Reinvigorating Tumor&#8208;Associated Dendritic Cells with Hierarchical Lipid Rewiring Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial mediators of innate and adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immunity, whereas exogenously&#8208; and endogenously&#8208;driven lipid accumulation causes immune tolerance of tumor&#8208;associated DCs (TADCs) and thereby diminishes tumor responsiveness to various therapies. Herein, we design a type of multilevel lipid rewiring nanoparticles (NPs) for TADC revitalization. These self&#8208;assembled NPs specifically bind to the lipid transport receptor Msr1 on the TADC surface and orchestrate the restriction of extracellular lipid uptake, cytoplasmic de novo lipid biosynthesis and nuclear lipogenic gene transcription. We find that the slimming of TADCs via the three&#8208;in&#8208;one lipid metabolic reprogramming substantially promotes their maturation and rehabilitate their functions in inflammatory cytokine production, cytotoxic T cell recruitment and tumor inhibition. Significantly, it further overcomes tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our study presents a non&#8208;canonical strategy to remodel tumor&#8208;infiltrating immune cells and paves a new path for improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Controlled Magnetotransport and Electrostatic Modulation of Magnetism in 2D Magnetic Semiconductor CrPS4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Using field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) to explore atomically thin magnetic semiconductors with transport measurements is difficult, because the very narrow bands of most 2D magnetic semiconductors cause carrier localization, preventing transistor operation. Here, we&#160;show that exfoliated layers of CrPS4 &#8211;a 2D layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor whose bandwidth approaches 1&#160;eV&#8211; allow the realization of FETs that operate properly down to cryogenic temperature. Using these devices, we&#160;perform conductance measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field, to determine the full magnetic phase diagram, which includes a spin&#8208;flop and a spin&#8208;flip phase. We&#160;find that the magnetoconductance depends strongly on gate voltage, reaching values as high as 5000&#160;% near the threshold for electron conduction. The gate voltage also allows the magnetic states to be tuned, despite the relatively large thickness of the CrPS4 multilayers employed in our&#160;study. Our&#160;results show the need to employ 2D magnetic semiconductors with sufficiently large bandwidth to realize properly functioning transistors, and identify a candidate material to realize a fully gate&#8208;tunable half&#8208;metallic&#160;conductor.

         <title>Substrate Engineering for Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth of Large&#8208;Scale Two&#8208;Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The large&#8208;scale production of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is essential to realize their industrial applications. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been considered as a promising method for the controlled growth of high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;scale 2D TMDs. During a CVD process, the substrate plays a crucial role in anchoring the source materials, promoting the nucleation and stimulating the epitaxial growth. It thus significantly affects the thickness, microstructure, and crystal quality of the products, which are particularly important for obtaining 2D TMDs with expected morphology and size. Here, we provide an insightful review by focusing on the recent development associated with the substrate engineering strategies for CVD preparation of large&#8208;scale 2D TMDs. First, the interaction between 2D TMDs and substrates, a key factor for the growth of high&#8208;quality materials, is systematically discussed by combining the latest theoretical calculations. Based on this, the effect of various substrate engineering approaches on the growth of large&#8208;area 2D TMDs is summarized in detail. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of substrate engineering for the future development of 2D TMDs are discussed. This review might provide deep insight into the controllable growth of high&#8208;quality 2D TMDs toward their industrial&#8208;scale practical applications.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Leakage&#8208;Free Healable Phase Change Interface Materials with Extraordinary High Thermal Conductivity and Low Thermal Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase change material (PCM) has received considerable attention to take advantage of both pad&#8208;type and grease&#8208;type thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the fatal drawbacks of leaking, non&#8208;recyclability, and low thermal conductivity (&#954;) hinder industrial applications of PCM TIMs. Here&#160;we report leakage&#8208;free healable PCM TIMs with extraordinary high &#954; and low total thermal resistance (Rt). The matrix material (OP) is synthesized by covalently functionalizing octadecanol PCM with polyethylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate polymer through the nucleophilic epoxy ring opening reaction. The OP changes from semi&#8208;crystalline to amorphous above the phase transition temperature, preventing leaking. The hydrogen&#8208;bond forming functional groups in OP enable nearly perfect healing efficiencies in tensile strength (99.7%), &#954; (97.0%), and Rt (97.4%). The elaborately designed thermally conductive fillers, silver flakes and multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles (nAgMWNTs), are additionally introduced in the OP matrix (OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT). The nAgMWNTs bridge silver flake islands, resulting in extraordinary high &#954; (43.4 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) and low Rt (30.5 mm2KW&#8722;1) compared with PCM TIMs in literature. Excellent heat dissipation and recycling demonstration of the OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT is also carried out using a computer graphic processing unit. The OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT is a promising future TIM for thermal management of mechanical and electrical devices.

         <title>Research Progress in Donor&#8722;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are new organic porous materials constructed by covalent bonds, with the advantages of pre&#8208;designable topology, adjustable pore size and abundant active sites. Many research studies have shown that COFs exhibit great potential in gas adsorption, molecular separation, catalysis, drug delivery, energy storage, etc. However, the electrons and holes of intrinsic COF are prone to compounding in transport, and the carrier lifetime is short. The donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type COFs, which are synthesized by introducing D and A units into the COFs backbone, combine separated electron and hole migration pathway, tunable band gap and optoelectronic properties of D&#8208;A type polymers with the unique advantages of COFs and have made great progress in related research in recent years. Here, the synthetic strategies of D&#8722;A type COFs are firstly outlined, including the rational design of linkages and D&#8722;A units as well as functionalization approaches. Then the applications of D&#8722;A type COFs in catalytic reactions, photothermal therapy and electronic materials are systematically summarized. In the final section, the current challenges, and new directions for the development of D&#8722;A type COFs are presented.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;wave pumped perovskite lasers with device area below 1 &#956;m2</title>

Abstract
Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pumped lasers with device areas below 1 &#956;m2 constitute a key step to meeting the energy efficiency requirement for on&#8208;chip optical communications. However, a debate about whether a submicron device size and low threshold can be simultaneously satisfied has persisted owing to insurmountable radiation losses when approaching the optical diffraction limit. Herein, we demonstrate a record&#8208;small CW optically pumped perovskite laser with a device area of 0.65 &#956;m2. We find the thresholds of submicron lasers can be lower than those of several&#8208;micron counterparts, and ascribe it to the enlarged group refractive index and modal confinement resulting from the enhanced exciton&#8211;photon coupling. Moreover, the operation temperature is elevated to 150 K through the reduction in heat generation. Our findings unveil the potential of exciton&#8211;polaritons in laser miniaturization, providing an alternative for developing low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers without artificial optical cavities, to approach the optical diffraction limit.

         <title>Curved Nanographenes: Multiple Emission, Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence, and Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The intriguing and rich photophysical properties of three curved nanographenes (CNG), each containing a corannulene (Cor) and a tert&#8208;butylhexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC&#8208;tBu) fragment, have been investigated as a function of their structural design (loose&#8208;helicene, CNG 6; cycloheptatrienically constrained helicene, CNG 8; cycloheptatrienically plus sterically constrained helicene, CNG 7). All CNG exhibit narrow fluorescence in the visible range (50&lt;FWHM&lt;75&#160;nm) and singlet oxygen production quantum yields up to 47% that confirm significant participation of triplet excited states in their photophysics even at room temperature. Time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra suggest that different singlet and triplet excited states are involved in their photoluminescence properties. CNG 7 and 8 exhibit dual fluorescence, as well as dual phosphorescence at low temperature in the main PL bands, evidenced by wavelength&#8208;dependent PL decays. In addition, hot bands are detected in fluorescence as well as phosphorescence and, in the temperature range of 100&#8211;140 K, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with TADF lifetimes on the millisecond time scale is observed. These findings are rationalized by quantum&#8208;chemical simulations which allow to establish the topography of the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces of the three CNG. Whereas the S1 potential of CNG 6 is predicted to exhibit a single minimum, two S1 minima are found for CNG 7 and CNG 8, with considerable geometric reorganization between them, in agreement with the experimentally observed dual fluorescence of these chromophores. Additionally, a higher&#8208;lying S2 minimum close to S1 has been optimized for the three CNG, from where emission is also possible due to thermal activation and, hence, non&#8208;Kasha behavior. The presence of higher&#8208;lying dark triplet states close to the S1 minima provides mechanistic evidence for the TADF phenomena observed in the CNG. Non&#8208;radiative decay of the T1 state appears to be thermally activated with activation energies of roughly 100 meV and leads to disappearance of phosphorescence at T &gt; 140 K.

         <title>Quantum size effect to induce colossal high&#8208;temperature energy storage density and efficiency in polymer/inorganic cluster composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer dielectrics need to operate at high temperatures to meet the demand of electrostatic energy storage in modern electronic and electrical systems. The polymer nanocomposite approach, an extensively proved strategy for the performance improvement, encounters the bottleneck of reduced energy density and poor discharge efficiency beyond 150&#176;C. Here, we report a polymer/metal oxide cluster composite prepared based on the &#8220;site isolation&#8221; strategy. Capitalizing on the quantum size effect, the bandgap and surface defect states of the ultra&#8208;small inorganic clusters (2.2&#160;nm diameter) are modulated to markedly differ from the regular&#8208;sized nanoparticles. Experimental results in conjunction with computational simulation demonstrate that, the presence of ultra&#8208;small inorganic clusters can introduce more abundant, deeper traps in the composite dielectric with respect to the conventional polymer/nanoparticle blends. Unprecedented high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance including colossal energy density (6.8 J&#160;cm&#8722;3), ultra&#8208;high discharge efficiency (95%) and superior stability at different electric field frequencies, are achieved in these polymer/cluster composites up to 200&#176;C. Along with the advantages in material preparation (inexpensive precursors and one&#8208;pot synthesis), such polymer/inorganic cluster composite approach is promising for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage in practical power apparatus and electronic devices.

         <title>Supramolecular Ionogels Tougher Than Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Common natural and synthetic high&#8208;strength materials (such as rubber, plastics, ceramics, and metals) undergo the occurrence of poor deformability. Achieving high strength and large deformation simultaneously is a huge challenge. Herein, we developed high&#8208;strength ionogels through the synergy of force&#8208;induced crystallization and halometallate ionic liquid created supramolecular ionic networks. The prepared polyvinyl alcohol/halometallate ionic liquid ionogels show the excellent mechanical properties, including ultimate fracture stress (63.1 &#177; 2.1&#160;MPa), strain (5248 &#177; 113%), and unprecedented toughness (1947 &#177; 52&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) which is much higher than that of most metals and alloys. Furthermore, the ionogels can achieve reversibility by water to realize green recovery and restoration of damaged mechanical properties.

         <title>Microfluidic templated stem cell spheroids microneedles for diabetic wound treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wound dressing patches based on stem cells have demonstrated promising potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds, while their capabilities in the maintenance of cell stemness, effective exchange of cellular substance, and precise targeting of the stem cells remain to be promoted. Here, we present a novel stem cell spheroid&#8208;loaded microneedle (MN@SPs) patch using microfluidic templating technology. By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibited advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, our microfluidic&#8208;engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.

         <title>Post&#8208;Maturation Reinforcement of 3d&#8208;Printed Vascularized Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite advances in biomaterials engineering, a large gap remains between the weak mechanical properties that can be achieved with natural materials and the strength of synthetic materials. Here, we present a method for reinforcing an engineered cardiac tissue fabricated from differentiated iPSCs and an ECM&#8208;based hydrogel in a manner that is fully biocompatible. The reinforcement occurs as a post&#8208;fabrication step, which allows for the use of 3D printing technology to generate thick, fully cellularized, and vascularized cardiac tissues. After tissue assembly and during the maturation process in a soft hydrogel, a small, tissue&#8208;penetrating reinforcer is deployed, leading to a significant increase in the tissue's mechanical properties. The tissue's robustness is demonstrated by injecting the tissue in a simulated minimally invasive procedure and showing that the tissue is functional and undamaged at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macro&#8208;scales.

         <title>Life Cycle Assessment of Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
MXenes, two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been investigated for diverse applications since their&#160;discovery, however, their life cycle analysis (LCA) has not been studied. Here, we perform a &#8220;cradle to gate&#8221; LCA to assess the cumulative energy demand (CED) and environmental impacts of lab&#8208;scale synthesis of Ti3C2Tx, the most researched MXene composition. We selected electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding as it is one of MXenes' most promising applications and compared Ti3C2Tx synthesis LCA to aluminum and copper foils, two typical EMI shielding materials. Two laboratory&#8208;scale MXene synthesis systems&#8212;gram and kilogram batches&#8212;were examined. We investigated the CED and environmental implications of Ti3C2Tx based on its precursor production, selective etching, delamination processes, laboratory location, energy mix, and raw material type. Our results show that laboratory electricity usage for the synthesis processes accounts for &gt; 70% of the environmental impacts. Manufacturing 1.0&#160;kg of industrials&#8208;scale aluminum and copper foil releases 23.0&#160;kg and 8.75&#160;kg of CO2, respectively, while 1.0&#160;kg of lab&#8208;scale MXene synthesis released 428.10&#160;kg. Chemical usage is less impactful than electricity, which suggests recycled resources and renewable energy can make more sustainable MXene synthesis. Understanding MXene LCA will help with the industrial&#8208;scale manufacture of this 2D material

&lt;p&gt;MXenes, two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been investigated for diverse applications since their&#160;discovery, however, their life cycle analysis (LCA) has not been studied. Here, we perform a &#8220;cradle to gate&#8221; LCA to assess the cumulative energy demand (CED) and environmental impacts of lab-scale synthesis of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, the most researched MXene composition. We selected electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding as it is one of MXenes' most promising applications and compared Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; synthesis LCA to aluminum and copper foils, two typical EMI shielding materials. Two laboratory-scale MXene synthesis systems&#8212;gram and kilogram batches&#8212;were examined. We investigated the CED and environmental implications of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; based on its precursor production, selective etching, delamination processes, laboratory location, energy mix, and raw material type. Our results show that laboratory electricity usage for the synthesis processes accounts for &amp;gt; 70% of the environmental impacts. Manufacturing 1.0&#160;kg of industrials-scale aluminum and copper foil releases 23.0&#160;kg and 8.75&#160;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, while 1.0&#160;kg of lab-scale MXene synthesis released 428.10&#160;kg. Chemical usage is less impactful than electricity, which suggests recycled resources and renewable energy can make more sustainable MXene synthesis. Understanding MXene LCA will help with the industrial-scale manufacture of this 2D material

         <title>Ultra&#8208;soft Organogel Artificial Muscles Exhibiting High Power Density, Large Stroke, Fast Response and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Air</title>

Abstract
Polymeric gel&#8208;based artificial muscles exhibiting tissue&#8208;matched Young's modulus (10&#160;Pa&#8208;1&#160;MPa) promise to be core components in future soft machines with inherently safe human&#8208;machine interactions. However, the ability to simultaneously generate fast, large, high&#8208;power and long&#8208;lasting actuation in the open&#8208;air environment, has yet been demonstrated in this class of ultra&#8208;soft materials. Herein, to overcome this hurdle, we report the design and synthesis of a twisted and coiled liquid crystalline glycerol&#8208;organogel (TCLCG). Such material with a low Young's modulus of 133&#160;kPa can surpass the actuation performance of skeletal muscles in a variety of aspects, including actuation strain (66%), actuation rate (275%/s), power density (438&#160;kW/m3) and work capacity (105&#160;kJ/m3). Notably, its power density is 14 times higher than the record of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric gels. No actuation performance degradation is detected in the TCLCG even after air exposure for 7 days, owing to the excellent water retention ability enabled by glycerol as co&#8208;solvent with water. Using TCLCG, we have successfully demonstrated mobile soft robots with extraordinary maneuverability in unstructured environments, including a crawler showing fast bidirectional locomotion (0.50&#160;mm/s) in a small&#8208;confined space, and a roller that can escape after deep burying in sand.

         <title>Metasurfaces&#8208;driven Hyperspectral Imaging via Multiplexed Plasmonic Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Obtaining single molecular level fingerprints of biomolecules and electron transfer dynamic imaging in living cells are critically demanded in postgenomic life sciences and medicine. However, the possible solution called Plasmonic Resonance Energy Transfer (PRET) spectroscopy remains challenging due to the fixed scattering spectrum of a plasmonic nanoparticle and limited multiplexing. Here, w e report multiplexed metasurfaces&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging to probe biological light&#8208;matter interactions. W e first design pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra over the entire visible range by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and grating effects of metasurface clusters. W e create pixelated metasurfaces and optically characterize their full darkfield coloration with visible color palettes and high&#8208;resolution color printings of the art pieces. Furthermore, w e apply three different biomolecules (i.e., chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and cytochrome c) on metasurfaces for color palettes to obtain selective molecular fingerprint imaging due to the unique biological light&#8208;matter interactions with application&#8208;specific biomedical metasurfaces. This metasurface&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging will open up a new path for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.

         <title>Metal Alloys&#8208;Structured Electrocatalysts: Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions, Coordination Microenvironments, and Structural Property&#8208;Reactivity Relationships</title>

Abstract
Metal alloys&#8208;structured electrocatalysts (MAECs) have made essential contributions to accelerating the practical applications of electrocatalytic devices in renewable energy systems. However, due to the complex atomic structures, varied electronic states, and abundant supports, precisely decoding the metal&#8208;metal interactions and structure&#8208;activity relationships of MAECs still confronts great challenges, which is critical to direct the future engineering and optimization of MAECs. Here, this timely review comprehensively summarizes the latest advances in creating the MAECs, including the metal&#8208;metal interactions, coordination microenvironments, and structure&#8208;activity relationships. First, the fundamental classification, design, characterization, and structural reconstruction of MAECs are outlined. Then, the electrocatalytic merits and modulation strategies of recent breakthroughs for noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;structured MAECs have been thoroughly discussed, such as solid solution alloys, intermetallic alloys, and single&#8208;atom alloys. Particularly, we give unique insights into the bond interactions, theoretical understanding, and operando techniques for mechanism disclosure. Thereafter, we discuss the current states of diverse MAECs with a unique focus on structural property&#8208;reactivity relationships, reaction pathways, and performance comparisons. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for MAECs are systematically discussed. We believe that this comprehensive review will offer a substantial impact on stimulating the widespread utilization of metal alloys&#8208;structured materials in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Ultra Coherent Single Electron Emission of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The single electron emitter, based on single quantized energy level, can potentially achieve ultimate temporal and spatial coherence with large emission current, which is desirable for the atomic resolution electron probe. This was first developed by constructing a nano&#8208;object on a metal tip to form a quantized double barrier structure. However, the single electron emission current can only achieve picoampere level due to the low electron tunneling rate of the heterojunction with large barrier width, which limits their practical applications. In this study, we demonstrated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can serve as a single electron emitter with current up to 1.5 nA. The double barrier structure formed on the CNT tip enables a high tunneling rate (&#8764;1012 s&#8722;1) due to the smaller barrier width. The emitter also shows high temporal coherence (energy dispersion &#8764;10 meV) and spatial coherence (effective source radius &#8764;0.85&#160;nm). This work represents a high coherent electron source to simplify the electron optics system of atomic resolution electron microscopy and sub&#8208;10&#160;nm electron beam lithography.

         <title>Horizontal and Vertical Coalescent Microrobotic Collectives Using Ferrofluid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed coalescent collective system exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal and vertical collectives. Under a&#160;time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns, to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. The reconfigurability of these droplet collectives significantly extends the functionality of ferrofluid&#8208;based soft robots.








Abstract
Many artificial miniature robotic collectives have been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of inadequate individual capabilities. However, the basic building blocks of the reported collectives are mainly in the solid state, where the morphological boundaries of internal individuals are clear and cannot genuinely merge. Miniature robotic collectives based on liquid units still need to be explored; such on&#8208;demand mergeable swarm systems are advantageous for adapting to the changing external environment. Here, a strategy to achieve a coalescent collective system we&#160;presented that exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal multimodal and vertical gravity&#8208;resistant collectives and unveil pattern&#8208;enabled robotic functionalities. When subjected to a time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from horizontal collectives, including vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. Using experiments and simulations, the formation and transformation of different morphological collectives are shown and their robust environmental adaptability are demonstrated. Potential applications of the multimodal droplet collectives are presented, including exploring an unknown environment, targeted object delivery, and fluid flow filtration in a lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. This work may facilitate the design of microrobotic swarm systems and expand the range of materials for miniature robots.

         <title>Multimodal&#8208;Driven Magnetic Microrobots with Enhanced Bactericidal Activity for Biofilm Eradication and Removal from Titanium Mesh</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic microrobots, composed of halloysite nanotubes (backbone), iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (magnetic actuators), and coated with polyethylenimine in order to load ampicillin, exhibit multimodal and reconfigurable motion. These magnetic microrobots are used to kill and remove efficiently Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration.








Abstract
Modern micro/nanorobots can perform multiple tasks for biomedical and environmental applications. Particularly, magnetic microrobots can be completely controlled by a rotating magnetic field and their motion powered and controlled without the use of toxic fuels, which makes them most promising for biomedical application. Moreover, they are able to form swarms, allowing them to perform specific tasks at a larger scale than a single microrobot. In this work, they developed magnetic microrobots composed of halloysite nanotubes as backbone and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles as magnetic material allowing magnetic propulsion and covered these with polyethylenimine to load ampicillin and prevent the microrobots from disassembling. These microrobots exhibit multimodal motion as single robots as well as in swarms. In addition, they can transform from tumbling to spinning motion and vice&#8208;versa, and when in swarm mode they can change their motion from vortex to ribbon and back again. Finally, the vortex motion mode is used to penetrate and disrupt the extracellular matrix of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration, which improves the effect of the antibiotic's activity. Such magnetic microrobots for biofilm removal from medical implants could reduce implant rejection and improve patients&#8217; well&#8208;being.

         <title>Hydrogels and Bioprinting in Bone Tissue Engineering: Creating Artificial Stem&#8208;Cell Niches for in Vitro Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Advances in bioprinting have enabled the fabrication of complex tissue constructs with high speed and resolution. However, there remains significant structural and biological complexity within tissues that bioprinting is unable to recapitulate. Bone, for example, has a hierarchical organization ranging from the molecular to whole organ level. Current bioprinting techniques and the materials employed have imposed limits on the scale, speed, and resolution that can be achieved, rendering the technique unable to reproduce the structural hierarchies and cell&#8211;matrix interactions that are observed in bone. The shift towards biomimetic approaches in bone tissue engineering, where hydrogels provide biophysical and biochemical cues to encapsulated cells, is a promising approach to enhance the biological function and development of tissues for in vitro modelling. A major focus in bioprinting of bone tissue for in vitro modelling is creating the dynamic microenvironmental niches to support, stimulate, and direct the cellular processes for bone formation and remodeling. Hydrogels are ideal materials for imitating the extracellular matrix since they can be engineered to present various cues whilst allowing bioprinting. Here, we review recent advances in hydrogels and 3D bioprinting towards creating a microenvironmental niche that is conducive to tissue engineering of in vitro models of bone.
This review focuses on hydrogels and 3D bioprinting in bone tissue engineering for development of&#160;in vitro&#160;models of bone. It highlights challenges in recapitulating the biological complexity seen in bone and how synergistic application of dynamic hydrogels and innovative bioprinting pipelines could address these challenges to achieve bone models.

         <title>Multifunctional Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks Capsules Modulate Reactivity of Lead Iodide toward Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with Ultraviolet Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The two&#8208;step sequential deposition process is demonstrated as a reliable technology for the fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, the complete conversion of dense PbI2 to perovskite in planar PVSCs is tough without mesoporous titanium dioxide as support. Herein, multifunctional capsules consisting of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) encapsulant and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are introduced between tin oxide (SnO2) and lead iodide (PbI2) layer. Intriguingly, the capsule dopant interlayer benefits the formation of porous PbI2 film due to the porous nanostructure of ZIF&#8208;8 which is favorable for the subsequent intercalation reaction. Furthermore, the constituent of the perovskite precursor in ZIF&#8208;8 pores can convert into the crystal nuclei of perovskite by reacting with PbI2 first, thereby promoting further perovskite crystallization. Significantly, the incorporation of ZIF&#8208;8 can enhance the resistance of perovskite against ultraviolet (UV) illumination due to down&#8208;conversion effect. Consequently, the modified device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.08% and displays enhanced UV stability, which can sustain 83% of its original PCE under 365&#160;nm UV illumination for 300&#160;h. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains 90% of initial PCE after 1500&#160;h storage in dark ambient conditions with a relative humidity range of 50&#8764;70%.

         <title>A Composite of Hierarchical Porous MOFs and Halloysite Nanotube as Single&#8208;ion Conducting Electrolyte Toward High Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium Ionic Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a promising rechargeable electrochemical energy storage material has emerged in the fields of solid&#8208;state lithium battery. However, low ionic conductivity and high interfacial impedance still severely hamper the application of MOFs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE). Herein, a novel hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) material has been harvested through the in&#8208;situ growth of zinc nitrate hydroxide nanosheets, expressing excellent ion conductivity of 1.04&#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transference number of 0.71. Moreover, the morphology and structure of H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 was further optimized to obtain a composite H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT by decorating halloysite nanotubes (HNT). Notably, functionalized H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT as an electrolyte presents obvious enhancement on electrochemical properties: higher ionic conductivity of 7.74&#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1, better single&#8208;ion transmittability (tLi+ = 0.84), good interfacial compatibility as well as excellent rate performance. More importantly, the Li/LiFePO4 battery equipped with H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT SSE owns efficient lithium dendrite suppression and up to 84% capacity retention (104.16&#160;mA h g&#8722;1) after 200 times galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. This work enriches the solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion composite electrolyte materials, opening an entirely new way for enhancing electrochemical performance.

         <title>Thermally stable red&#8208;emitting oxide ceramics for laser lighting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Laser&#8208;driven phosphor&#8208;converted white light sources are highly desirable for their unprecedented energy efficiency and lighting quality. However, important challenges remain due to a lack of efficient and stable red&#8208;emitting materials. Here we explore Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based double perovskites as red emitters with thermally stable photoluminescence. Sr3TaO5.5:Eu2+ ceramics exhibit a red emission band peaking at 620&#160;nm upon blue laser pumping owing to the Eu2+ occupation at highly ordered substitutional lattice sites. A constructed laser&#8208;driven white light wheel under an incident power density of 19.2&#160;W/mm2 presents a record luminous flux of 1115&#160;lm with an excellent color rendering indexof 90. Our study invigorates the development of Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based ceramics with thermally stable luminescence for laser pumped lighting and display applications.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Molecular Pro&#8208;theranostic Agent for Photodynamic and Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components of the tumor&#8208;associated matrix, and play an important role in tumor progression and immunosuppression. Therefore, precise theranostics of CAFs are beneficial to CAFs&#8208;targeted therapies. However, imaging agents enabling precise theranostics of CAFs have been rarely exploited. To tackle this issue, we develop a molecular pro&#8208;theranostic probe (FMP) with activatable fluorescence, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in response to fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) overexpressed in more than 90% types of CAFs and some tumor cells. Attributing to efficient activatable photo&#8208;toxicity towards CAFs and tumor cells together with activated immunogenic cell death (ICD), complete tumor regression of primary tumors and abscopal effect of distant tumors are observed on the 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice model. By integration with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, enhanced systemic immune responses have been evoked to obtain long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression of both primary and distant tumors as well as arrest systemic cancer metastasis in living mice.

         <title>A Recyclable Standalone Microporous Layer with Interpenetrating Network for Sustainable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The commercialization of fuel cells inevitably brings recycling problems. Therefore, achieving high recyclability of fuel cells is particularly important for their sustaianble development. Herein, a recyclable standalone microporous layer (MPL) with interpenetrating network that can significantly enhance the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells was prepared. The interpenetrating network enables the standalone MPL with high strength (17.7&#160;MPa), gas permeability (1.55 &#215; 10&#8722;13 m2), and fuel cell performance (peak power density 1.35&#160;W cm&#8722;2), providing the basic guarantee for its application in high&#8208;performance and highly recyclable fuel cells. Additionally, the standalone MPL is highly adaptable to various GDBs, providing high possibility to select highly recyclable GDBs. Outstandingly, the standalone MPL and gas diffusion backing (GDB) can be easily detached from spent membrane electrode assembly (MEA). This not only saves &gt; 90 vol% solvent in the recovery of catalyst coated membrane (CCM), but also extends the service life of GDBs and standalone MPLs at least 138 times (2,760,000 hours assuming 20,000 hours of CCM) comparing to CCM. Therefore, the standalone MPL significantly enhances the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells and is promising to be an indispensable component in the next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

         <title>Synchronous Interventions of Glucose and Mitochondrial Metabolisms for Antitumor Bioenergetic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;based mitochondrial bioenergetic intervention is an attractive therapeutic modality. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited owning to metabolic plasticity, which allows tumors to shift their metabolic phenotype between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis for energy compensation. To overcome this flexibility, a glycopolymer containing a caged H2S and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dual&#8208;donor (1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose [thioglucose]) was synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase (GOx) for complete depletion of tumorigenic energy sources. The loaded GOx catalyzed the glutathione&#8208;activated thioglucose to generate cytotoxic H2S/H2O2, which further induced synergistic defects in mitochondrial function by suppressing cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV) expression and damaging the mitochondrial membrane potential. GOx also blocked glycolysis by depleting endogenous glucose. This synchronous intervention strategy exhibited good anticancer performance, broadening the horizon of antitumor bioenergetic therapy.

         <title>Surface Ligand Engineering Ruthenium Nanozyme Superior to Horseradish Peroxidase for Enhanced Immunoassay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanozymes have great potential to be used as an alternative to natural enzymes in a variety of fields. However, low catalytic activity compared with natural enzymes limits their practical use. It is still challenging to design nanozymes comparable with their natural counterparts in terms of specific activity. In this study, a surface engineering strategy is employed to improve the specific activity of Ru nanozymes using charge&#8208;transferrable ligands such as polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). PSS modified Ru nanozyme exhibits a peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like specific activity of up to 2820 U mg&#8722;1, which is twice that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1305 U mg&#8722;1). Mechanism studies suggest that PSS readily accepts negative charge from Ru, thus reducing the affinity between Ru and &#183;OH. Importantly, the modified Ru&#8208;POD nanozyme is successfully used to develop an immunoassay for human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein (AFP) and achieves a 140&#8208;fold increase in detection sensitivity compared with traditional HRP&#8208;based ELISA. Therefore, this work provides a feasible route to design nanozyme with high specific activity that meets the practical use as an alternative to natural enzyme.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Masked Resiquimod Activated by Hypoxia for Selective Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resiquimod (R848) is an immunomodulator causing a severe systemic inflammatory reaction due to low tumor selectivity, thus hindering its use in cancer therapy. Therefore, an azide&#8208;masked prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) of R848 was developed, which was selectively activated to R848 in hypoxic tumors. R848&#8208;N3 significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in treated mice to 1/12 compared to R848 at the same dose. In addition, combretastatin A4 nanoparticles (CA4&#8208;NPs) were used to enhance the tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3 by elevating the level of tumor hypoxia. R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs had higher tumor selectivity than the intratumoral injection of R848 at 1&#160;h after administration. The concentration of the active R848 in the tumor was 21.45&#8208;fold that in the heart. Benefiting from the high tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3, R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs+anti&#8208;PD1 exerted 94.1% tumor suppression and 40.0% tumor cure. Therefore, this work highlighted the potential of azide&#8208;masking strategy in the development of tumor&#8208;selective prodrugs with reduced toxicity.

         <title>Ultrahigh Mass&#8208;Loading Integrated Free&#8208;Standing Functional All&#8208;Carbon Positive Electrode Prepared Using Architecture Tailoring Strategy for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Dual Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have been attracting great attention recently for the storage of stationary energy due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, most reports on DIBs involve low mass&#8208;loading electrodes (&lt;2.5&#160;mg), while the use of high mass&#8208;loading electrodes (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8211;2), which are critical for practical application, is often overlooked. In the present study, an integrated free&#8208;standing functional carbon positive electrode MSCG with a &#8220;point&#8208;line&#8208;plane&#8221; hierarchical architecture at the practical level of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading (&gt;50&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) is developed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density DIBs. The rationally designed microstructure and the advanced assembly method that was adopted produce a well&#8208;interconnected ion/electron transport channel in the MSCG positive electrode, which confers rapid ion/electron kinetic properties to the positive electrode while maintaining good mechanical properties. Consequently, the DIBs with ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading MSCG positive electrodes exhibits a high discharge capacity of 100.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C (loading mass of 50&#160;mg cm&#8211;2), and a long&#8208;term cycling performance is also achieved with a capacity retention of 87.7% at 1 C after 500 cycles (loading mass of 23&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the DIB with the ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading positive electrode achieves a high energy density of 379&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 based on the mass of electrode materials, which is the highest value recorded to date for any DIBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-ion batteries (DIBs) have been attracting great attention recently for the storage of stationary energy due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, most reports on DIBs involve low mass-loading electrodes (&amp;lt;2.5&#160;mg), while the use of high mass-loading electrodes (&amp;gt;10&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which are critical for practical application, is often overlooked. In the present study, an integrated free-standing functional carbon positive electrode MSCG with a &#8220;point-line-plane&#8221; hierarchical architecture at the practical level of ultrahigh mass-loading (&amp;gt;50&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is developed for high-energy-density DIBs. The rationally designed microstructure and the advanced assembly method that was adopted produce a well-interconnected ion/electron transport channel in the MSCG positive electrode, which confers rapid ion/electron kinetic properties to the positive electrode while maintaining good mechanical properties. Consequently, the DIBs with ultrahigh mass-loading MSCG positive electrodes exhibits a high discharge capacity of 100.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 C (loading mass of 50&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and a long-term cycling performance is also achieved with a capacity retention of 87.7% at 1 C after 500 cycles (loading mass of 23&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, the DIB with the ultrahigh mass-loading positive electrode achieves a high energy density of 379&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; based on the mass of electrode materials, which is the highest value recorded to date for any DIBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Transport layer engineering towards lower threshold for perovskite lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Charge transport layers are essential for achieving electrically pumped perovskite lasers. However, their role in perovskite lasing is not fully understood. Here, we explore the role of charge transport layers on the lasing actions of perovskite films by investigating the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds. We demonstrate a largely reduced ASE threshold and enhanced ASE intensity by introducing an additional hole transport layer poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA). We show that the key role of the PTAA layer is to accelerate the hot carrier cooling process by extracting holes in perovskites. With reduced hot holes, the Auger recombination loss is largely suppressed, resulting in decreased ASE threshold. Our argument is further supported by the fact that the ASE threshold can be further reduced from 25.7 to 7.2 &#956;J/cm2 upon switching the pumping wavelength from 400&#160;nm to 500&#160;nm to directly avoid excess hot hole generation. Our work for the first time exemplifies how to further reduce the ASE threshold with transport layer engineering through hot hole manipulation. This is critical to maintaining the excellent gain properties of perovskites when integrating them into electrical devices, paving the way for electrically pumped perovskite lasers.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping in Ordered and Disordered Domains of Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors in electrochemical applications for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics and energy harvesting. The design of efficient electrochemical devices relies on large modulations of the polymer conductivity, fast doping/dedoping kinetics, and high ionic uptake. In this work, structure&#8208;property relations are established and control of these parameters by the co&#8208;existence of order and disorder in the phase morphology is demonstrated. Using in&#8208;situ time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman and terahertz conductivity measurements, the electrochemical doping in the different morphological domains of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) is investigated. The main finding is that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favoured. On the other hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct regions. A significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity is evident when bipolarons start forming in the disordered regions, while the presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. This study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced increase in conductivity.

         <title>Lest we Forget &#8211; the Importance of Heteroatom Interactions in Heterocyclic Conjugated Systems, from Synthetic Metals to Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The field of synthetic metals was, and remains, highly influential for the development of organic semiconductor materials. Yet, with the passing of time and the rapid development of conjugated materials in recent years, the link between synthetic metals and organic semiconductors is at risk of being forgotten. In this review, we reflect on one of the key concepts developed in synthetic metals &#8211; heteroatom interactions. The application of this strategy in recent organic semiconductor materials, small molecules and polymers, is highlighted, with analysis of X&#8208;ray crystal structures and comparisons with model systems used to determine the influence of these non&#8208;covalent short contacts. The case is made that the wide range of effective heteroatom interactions and the high performance that has been achieved in devices from organic solar cells to transistors is testament to the seeds sown by the synthetic metals research community.

         <title>Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generator with Hygroscopic Materials: A Review and New Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The global energy crisis caused by the overconsumption of non&#8208;renewable fuels has prompted researchers to develop alternative strategies for producing electrical energy. In this review, we introduce a fascinating strategy that simply utilizes water, an abundant natural substance throughout the globe and even in air as moisture, as a power source. The concept of the hydrovoltaic electricity generator (HEG) proposed herein involves generating an electrical potential gradient by exposing the two ends of the HEG device to dissimilar physicochemical environments, which leads to the production of an electrical current through the active material. HEGs, with a large variety of viable active materials, have much potential for expansion toward diverse applications including permanent and/or emergency power sources. In this review, we discuss representative HEGs that generate electricity by the mechanisms of diffusion, streaming, and capacitance as case studies for building a fundamental understanding of the electricity generation process. In particular, by comparing the use and absence of hygroscopic materials, we meticulously elucidate HEG mechanism studies to establish active material design principles. We conclude the review with future perspectives on electrode design using conducting nanomaterials, considerations for high performance device construction, and potential impacts of the HEG technology in improving our livelihoods.

         <title>Electrostatic Attractive Self&#8208;Delivery of siRNA and Light&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Escape for Synergistic Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) holds immense promise for suppressing gene expression and treating various life&#8208;threatening diseases, including cancer. However, efficient delivery and lysosomal escape remain critical challenges that hinder the therapeutic effectiveness of siRNA. Herein, cationic photosensitizer (NB&#8208;Br) was grafted onto polo&#8208;like kinase 1 (PLK1) siRNA to form an amphiphilic siRNA&#8208;photosensitizer conjugate (siPLK1&#8208;NB), which could self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs) via electrostatic attraction. Notably, siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs exhibited rapid and efficient cell endocytosis, as well as outstanding tumor&#8208;targeting property in multiple tumor&#8208;bearing mice models. When siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs were located inside tumor cell lysosomes, the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) after photoactivation could disrupt the lysosome membrane structure and facilitate siRNA escape from lysosomes. Under light irradiation, siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs could downregulate PLK1 expression and induce photodynamic killing, effectively inhibiting tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, this study provides a novel design strategy for carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery system based on electrostatic attraction.

         <title>Micro/Nano Hierarchical Structures Physically Engineered on Surface: Analysis and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high demand for micro/nano hierarchical structures as components of functional substrates, bioinspired devices, energy&#8208;related electronics, and chemical/physical transducers has inspired their in&#8208;depth studies and active development of the related fabrication techniques. In particular, significant progress has been achieved in hierarchical structures physically engineered on surface, which offer the advantages of wide&#8208;range material compatibility, design diversity, and mechanical stability, and numerous unique structures with important niche applications have been developed. This review categorizes the basic components of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surface according to function/shape and comprehensively summarizes the related advances, focusing on the fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surface are compared based on the function of their basic components, which may help to avoid the bottlenecks of conventional single&#8208;scale functional substrates. Thus, the present work is expected to provide a useful reference for scientists working on multicomponent functional substrates and inspire further research in this field.

         <title>Microenvironment Activated Nanozymes&#8208;Armed Bacteriophages Efficiently Combat Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the greatest challenges to public health, requiring new therapeutic methods. Herein, an innovative nanozyme&#8208;armed phage (phage@Pd) system is fabricated for combating bacterial infection. The proposed phage@Pd preserves the function of the phages to achieve precise recognition and adhesion to the host Escherichia coli (E. coli). In aid of the phages, the ultrasmall palladium (Pd) nanozymes equipped with conspicuous pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity can generate toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) around the bacteria in acidic and H2O2&#8208;overexpressed infection microenvironment while keeping inert in physiological conditions, thus realizing the noteworthy elimination of bacteria at infected site, in the meantime, ensuring the biological safety of phage@Pd in healthy tissues. In addition, the filamentous structure of phage@Pd can also enhance its bactericidal efficiency towards non&#8208;host bacteria by randomly tangling on them, indicating its possible broad&#8208;spectrum germicidal efficacy. Notably, phage@Pd can not only eradicate planktonic bacteria, but also kill the bacteria inside the biofilm in vitro. Both in vivo models of acute bacterial pneumonia or subcutaneous abscess, phage@Pd has shown significant activity in eliminating infection and promoting tissue recovery. These results demonstrate that the phage@Pd nanohybrid is a safe and effective antimicrobial agent, providing a new insight into development of advanced antibacterial materials.

         <title>Material Breakthroughs in Smart Food Monitoring: Intelligent Packaging and On&#8208;Site Testing Technologies for Spoilage and Contamination Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Despite extensive commercial and regulatory interventions, food spoilage and contamination continue to impose massive ramifications on human health and the global economy. Recognizing that such issues would be significantly eliminated by the accurate and timely monitoring of food quality markers, smart food sensors have garnered significant interest as platforms for both real&#8208;time, in&#8208;package food monitoring and on&#8208;site commercial testing. In both cases, the sensitivity, stability, and efficiency of the developed sensors are largely informed by underlying material design, driving focus towards the creation of advanced materials optimized for such applications. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of emerging intelligent materials and sensors developed in this space, through the lens of three key food quality markers &#8211; biogenic amines, pH, and pathogenic microbes. Each sensing platform is presented with targeted consideration towards the contributions of the underlying metallic or polymeric substrate to the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Further, the real&#8208;world applicability of presented works is considered with respect to their capabilities, regulatory adherence, and commercial potential. Finally, we provide a situational assessment of the current state of intelligent food monitoring technologies, discussing material&#8208;centric strategies to address their existing limitations, regulatory concerns, and commercial considerations.

         <title>Long&#8208;cycle Life Sodium&#8208;ion Battery Fabrication via Unique Chemical Bonding Interface Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H&#8208;NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilized the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enabled the H&#8208;NTO anode to stably operate for 80,000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H&#8208;NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at &#8208;40&#176;C. The excellent cycling stability was attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation behavior in ether&#8208;based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long&#8208;cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

The excellent cycling stability was attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface.

         <title>Brightened Bicomponent Perovskite Nano&#8208;Composite Based on F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Micro&#8208;LED Displays</title>

Abstract
The lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is making its way towards next&#8208;generation display applications, such as serving as color conversion layers (CCL) in micro&#8208;LED array. Red PQDs containing iodine exhibit weaker brightness compared with its green counterpart when it is employed as CCL. Therefore, PQDs with enhanced brightness is highly favorable for micro/mini&#8208;LED displays. We&#160;propose a universal strategy of bicomponent perovskite nano&#8208;composite (BPNC) with significantly enhanced PL intensity through the built&#8208;in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the core CsPbBr3 to the shell &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3, and confirm that it is through a pair of combined quasi&#8208;degenerate energy levels at blue spectra region that the FRET is conducted, resulting in a high excitation wavelength selectivity. Owing to the high&#8208;efficient energy transition route from blue excitation to red emission established by the FRET, the BPNC exhibits brightest single&#8208;peak red photoluminescence with near 100% quantum yield. The BPNC with FRET is further proven to be adaptable to a wide range of emission wavelength. We&#160;employed the BPNCs in a blue micro&#8208;LED array as color down&#8208;conversion layers and demonstrate excellent color conversion properties and high color gamut. This strategy of BPNC paves a road to the full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED&#160;displays.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Aerogels with Exceptional Mechanical Performance for Thermal Superinsulation at Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermal protection under extreme conditions requires materials with excellent thermal insulation properties and exceptional mechanical properties to withstand a variety of complex external stresses. Mesoporous silica aerogels are the most widely used insulation materials due to their ultralow thermal conductivity. However, they still suffer from mechanical fragility and structural instability in practical applications. Herein, we report a nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogel synthesized via in&#8208;situ growth of inorganic minerals in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network. The multiscale structural adaptation of the inorganic&#8208;organic components endows nanocomposite aerogels with rapid configuration recovery during ambient pressure drying. The resulted aerogels show ultralow thermal conductivities (17.4&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 1.0 atm). Our aerogels also integrate challenging mechanical properties, including high compressive stiffness to resist deformation under the pressure of an adult, superelasticity to prevent static and dynamic stress cracking even under the crushing of a vehicle (1.6 t), and high bending flexibility to adapt to any surface. Moreover, they exhibit excellent structural stability under fatigue stress/strain cycles over a wide temperature range (&#8208;196 to 200&#176;C).The combination of high thermal insulation performance and excellent mechanical properties offers a potential material system for robust thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, especially for aerospace applications.

         <title>NiSi: New Venue for Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Envisaging antiferromagnetic spintronics pivots on two key criteria of high transition temperature and tuning of underlying magnetic order using straightforward application of magnetic field or electric current. Here, we&#160;show that NiSi metal can provide suitable new platform in this quest. First, our&#160;study unveils high temperature antiferromagnetism in single crystal NiSi with TN &#10878; 700 K. Antiferromagnetic order in NiSi is accompanied by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnetic character with small ferromagnetic component in a&#8208;c plane. Second, we&#160;find that NiSi manifests distinct magnetic and electronic hysteresis responses to field applications due to the disparity in two moment directions. While magnetic hysteresis is characterized by one&#8208;step switching between ferromagnetic states of uncompensated moment, electronic behavior is ascribed to metamagnetic switching phenomena between non&#8208;collinear spin configurations. Importantly, the switching behaviors persist to high temperature. The properties underscore the importance of NiSi in the pursuit of antiferromagnetic&#160;spintronics.

Second, we&#160;find that NiSi manifests distinct magnetic and electronic hysteresis responses to field applications due to the disparity in two moment directions. While magnetic hysteresis is characterized by one-step switching between ferromagnetic states of uncompensated moment, electronic behavior is ascribed to metamagnetic switching phenomena between non-collinear spin configurations. Importantly, the switching behaviors persist to high temperature. The properties underscore the importance of NiSi in the pursuit of antiferromagnetic&#160;spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dynamical behaviors of oscillating metallosurfactant coacervate microdroplets under redox stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Living systems create complex structures and functions by mastering self&#8208;organization in a variety of equilibrium and nonequilibrium states. Mimicking the dynamical phenomena with synthetic cell&#8208;like entities (protocell) under nonequilibrium conditions offers an important step towards the representation of minimum life. Here we report cell&#8208;sized coacervate microdroplets assembled from associative metallosurfactant coacervation via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibits nonequilibrium behaviors. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronized into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles with external redox stress. The collective oscillation of abiotic metallosurfactant microdroplets can sustain both in solution and at the colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport and passing through nanosized channels reminiscent of red blood cells that can deform and squeeze through narrow capillaries. The design of self&#8208;oscillating cell&#8208;sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life&#8208;like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Greatly Suppressed Residual Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the swift rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to more than 32%, the instability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is still one of the key obstacles to practical application and is closely related to the residual strain of perovskite films. Herein, a simple surface reconstruction strategy is developed to achieve a global incorporation of butylammonium cations at both surface and bulk grain boundaries by post&#8208;treating perovskite films with a mixture of N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide and n&#8208;butylammonium iodide in isopropanol solvent, enabling strain&#8208;free perovskite films with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration and improved energy level alignment. As a result, the corresponding single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells yield a champion PCE of 21.8%, while maintaining 100% and 81% of their initial PCEs without encapsulation after storage for over 2500&#160;h in N2 and 1800&#160;h in air, respectively. Remarkably, we further demonstrate a certified stabilized PCE of 29.0% for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts. The unencapsulated tandem device retains 86.6% of its initial performance after 306 hours at maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous xenon&#8208;lamp illumination without filtering ultraviolet (in air, 20&#8211;35 &#176;C, 25&#8211;75%RH, most often &#8764;60%RH).

         <title>A Gas/phototheranostic Nanocomposite Integrates NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Peak Absorbing Aza&#8208;BODIPY with Thermal&#8208;sensitive Nitric Oxide Donor for Atraumatic Osteosarcoma Therapy</title>

Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has received increasing interest in cancer therapeutics owing to its excellent efficacy and controllability. However, there are two major limitations in PTT applications, which are the tissue penetration depth of lasers within the absorption range of photothermal agents and the unavoidable tissue empyrosis induced by high&#8208;energy lasers. Herein, a gas/phototheranostic nanocomposite (NA1020&#8208;NO@PLX) was engineered that integrated the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak absorbing aza&#8208;BODIPY (NA1020) with the thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor (S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine, SNAP). An enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism was proposed to achieve the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak absorbance (&#955;max = 1020&#160;nm) on NA1020, thereby obtaining its deep tissue penetration depth. The NA1020 exhibited a remarkable photothermal conversion, making it feasible for the deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy and providing favorable NIR&#8208;II emission to precisely pinpoint the tumor for a visible PTT process. The simultaneously investigated atraumatic therapeutic process with an enhanced cell apoptosis mechanism indicated the feasibility of the synergistic NO/low&#8208;temperature PTT for osteosarcoma. Herein, this gas/phototheranostic strategy optimized the existing PTT to present a repeatable and atraumatic photothermal therapeutic process for deep&#8208;tissue tumors, validating its potential clinical applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Super&#8208;filling Construction of Metal Artificial Interface for Long&#8208;term Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Zinc (Zn) metal anodes are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale, highly safe energy storage systems. However, their cycling life is associated with instability issues such as dendritic growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. Introducing an artificial metal interface is expected to help overcome this challenge owing to the optimisation of the absorption, nucleation, and growth of Zn2+. In this study, w e developed an ultrafast, universal, and cost&#8208;effective super&#8208;filling approach to construct a metal&#8211;artificial interface&#8211;decorated Zn anode in situ. Most zincophilic metals, including Sn, Cu, and Ag, can be used to construct a homogenous interface without any restrictions on the size, morphology, or curvature of the substrates. With Sn as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;obtained Sn@Zn anode is conducive for the homogenous Zn nuclei and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Symmetric cells with Sn@Zn electrodes could be operated for over 900&#160;h at different current densities. This superior performance contributed to the attractive electrochemical characteristics of both coin and scaled&#8208;up Sn@Zn//&#946;&#8208;MnO2 cells. Given the facile and cost&#8208;effective fabrication and recyclability of the cells, o ur work enables the efficient design and exploration of Zn anodes for research, industrialisation, and commercialisation purposes.

         <title>Review of Carbon Support Coordination Environments for Single Metal Atom Electrocatalysts (SACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This topical review focuses on the distinct role of carbon support coordination environment of single atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalysis. The article begins with an overview of atomic coordination configurations in SACs, including a discussion of the advanced characterization techniques and simulation used for understanding the active sites. A summary of key electrocatalysis applications is then provided. These processes are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The review then shifts to modulation of the metal atom&#8208;carbon coordination environments, focusing on nitrogen and other non&#8208;metal coordination through modulation at the first coordination shell and modulation in the second and higher coordination shells. Representative case studies are provided, starting with the classic four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#8208;N4) based SACs. Bimetallic coordination models including homo&#8208;paired and hetero&#8208;paired active sites are also discussed, being categorized as emerging approaches. The theme of the discussions is the correlation between synthesis methods for selective doping, the carbon structure &#8211; electron configuration changes associated with the doping, the analytical techniques used to ascertain these changes, and the resultant electrocatalysis performance. Critical unanswered questions as well as promising underexplored research directions are identified.

Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes are highly important for batteries due to their sustainability, greenness, and low cost. However, the free water molecules react violently with alkali metals, rendering the high&#8208;capacity of alkali metal anodes unusable. Here, we confined water molecules in a carcerand&#8208;like network to build quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes (QAEs) with reduced water molecules' freedom and matched them with the low&#8208;cost chloride salts. The formed QAEs possess substantially different properties than liquid water molecules, including stable operation with alkali metal anodes without gas evolution. Specifically, the alkali metal anodes could directly cycle in a water&#8208;based environment with suppressed dendrites growth, electrode dissolution, and the polysulfide shuttle. The Li metal symmetric cells achieved long&#8208;term cycling over 7,000&#160;h (and over 5,000/4,000&#160;h for Na/K symmetric cells), and all Cu&#8208;based alkali metal cells exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Full metal batteries, such as Li||S batteries, attained high Coulombic efficiency, long life (over 4,000 cycles), and unprecedented energy density among water&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Gastrointestinal peristalsis&#8208;inspired hydrogel actuators for NIR&#8208;controlled transport of viscous liquids</title>

Abstract
Liquid transportation is fundamentally important in microfluidics, water collection, biosensing and printing, and has attracted enormous research interest in the past decades. However, despite substantial progress, it remains a big challenge to achieve the controlled transport of viscous liquids (&gt;100 mPa&#8729;s) commonly existing in daily life and the chemical industry. Inspired by the gastrointestinal peristalsis of mammalians that can efficiently transport viscous chyme (viscosity up to 2,000 mPa&#8729;s) by the synergistic combination of contraction driving force and lubrication, this paper reports the design and construction of double&#8208;layered tubular hydrogel actuators for directional transport of highly viscous liquids ranging from &#8764;1000 mPa&#8729;s to &gt;80000 mPa&#8729;s under the control of an applied 808&#160;nm laser, which is attributed to the cooperation of outer layer contraction and water film lubrication of the inner layer. It's demonstrated that the actuators are capable of transporting polymerizing liquid whose viscosity significantly increases to &#8764;11182 mPa&#183;s in 2&#160;h. This work paves a new avenue towards directional transport of highly viscous liquids, which not only expands the research scope of liquid transportation, but will spur the design of new liquid actuators with potential applications in viscous liquid&#8208;based microfluidics, artificial blood vessels, and soft robots.

         <title>Improving OFF&#8208;State Bias&#8208;Stress Stability in High&#8208;Mobility Conjugated Polymer Transistors with an Antisolvent Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of the conjugated polymer indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole by acetonitrile (AN) or n&#8208;butyl acetate (NBA) antisolvent slightly enhances the crystallinity of the films as evidenced by grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction (left) and leads to an improved OFF&#8208;state bias&#8208;stress stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors with respect to untreated reference films (right).








Abstract
Conjugated polymer field&#8208;effect transistors are emerging as an enabling technology for flexible electronics due to their excellent mechanical properties combined with sufficiently high charge&#8208;carrier mobilities and compatibility with large&#8208;area, low&#8208;temperature processing. However, their electrical stability remains a concern. ON&#8208;state (accumulation mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities in organic semiconductors have been widely studied, and multiple mitigation strategies have been suggested. In contrast, OFF&#8208;state (depletion mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities remain poorly understood despite being crucial for many applications in which the transistors are held in their OFF&#8208;state for most of the time. Here, a simple method of using an antisolvent treatment is presented to achieve significant improvements in OFF&#8208;state bias&#8208;stress and environmental stability as well as general device performance for one of the best performing polymers, solution&#8208;processable indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDT&#8208;BT). IDT&#8208;BT is weakly crystalline, and the notable improvements to an antisolvent&#8208;induced, increased degree of crystallinity, resulting in a lower probability of electron trapping and the removal of charge traps is attributed. The work highlights the importance of the microstructure in weakly crystalline polymer films and offers a simple processing strategy for achieving the reliability required for applications in flexible electronics.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Modulated Untwist Deformations and Multispectral Optical Effects from Ion Intercalation into Chiral Ceramic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral V2O3 nanoparticles display rich palette of intense chiroptical bands. Intercalation&#8211;deintercalation of Zn2+ leads to twist&#8211;untwist deformation and modulation of optical activity, which is remarkably strong for IR and NIR range because V2O3 nanoparticles have g&#8208;factors &#8776;100&#8211;400 times higher than other nanostructures. Device prototypes based on layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled nanocomposite films provide a pathway to versatile voltage&#8208;driven photonic devices.








Abstract
Reconfiguration of chiral ceramic nanostructures after ion intercalation should favor specific nanoscale twists leading to strong chiroptical effects. &#160;In this work, V2O3 nanoparticles are shown to have &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral distortions caused by binding of tartaric acid enantiomers to the nanoparticle surface. As evidenced by spectroscopy/microscopy techniques and calculations of nanoscale chirality measures, the intercalation of Zn2+ ions into the V2O3 lattice results in particle expansion, untwist deformations, and chirality reduction. Coherent deformations in the particle ensemble manifest as changes in sign and positions of circular polarization bands at ultraviolet, visible, mid&#8208;infrared (IR), near&#8208;IR (NIR), and IR wavelengths. The g&#8208;factors observed for IR and NIR spectral diapasons are &#8776;100&#8211;400 times higher than those for previously reported dielectric, semiconductor, and plasmonic nanoparticles. Nanocomposite films layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled (LBL) from V2O3 nanoparticles reveal cyclic&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven modulation of optical activity. Device prototypes for IR and NIR range problematic for liquid crystals and other organic materials are demonstrated. High optical activity, synthetic simplicity, sustainable processability, and environmental robustness of the chiral LBL nanocomposites provide a versatile platform for photonic devices. Similar reconfigurations of particle shapes are expected for multiple chiral ceramic nanostructures, leading to unique optical, electrical, and magnetic properties.

         <title>Lymph&#8208;Node&#8208;Targeted Drug Delivery for Effective Immunomodulation to Prolong the Long&#8208;Term Survival After Heart Transplantation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeting drug delivery system decorated by a chemokine C&#8208;C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) specific aptamer can realize lymph&#8208;node&#8208;targeted immunomodulation with attenuated immune suppression on distant peripheral immune organs, resulting in effectively prolonged long&#8208;term survival after heart transplantation. This study provides an efficient strategy to achieve precise and localized immunoregulation with minimized side effects of immunosuppression.








Abstract
The chronic rejection responses and side effects of the systematic administration of immunosuppressants are the main obstacles to heart allograft and patient survival. The development of xenotransplantation also urgently requires more efficient immune regulation strategies. Herein, it is demonstrated that lymph&#8208;node (LN)&#8208;targeted drug delivery can realize LN&#8208;specific immunomodulation with attenuated immune suppression on distant peripheral immune organs to effectively prolong long&#8208;term survival after heart transplantation in a chronic murine heart transplantation model. A chemokine C&#8208;C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) specific aptamer for LN targeting is decorated onto the surface of the hybrid nanoparticular delivery vector mainly composed of CaCO3/CaP/heparin. The targeting delivery system can dramatically enhance accumulation of the loaded immunosuppressant, fingolimod hydrochloride (FTY720), in draining lymph nodes (dLNs) for inducing powerful immune suppression. By promoting the generation of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) and decreasing the proportion of effector T cells (Teffs) in dLNs after heart transplantation, the LN&#8208;targeting strategy can effectively regulate local immune responses instead of systemic immunity, which reduces the incidence of long&#8208;term complications. This study provides an efficient strategy to improve the survival rate after organ transplantation by precise and localized immunoregulation with minimized side effects of immunosuppression.

         <title>Arrested Phase Separation Enables High&#8208;Performance Keratoprostheses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermally treating a dense and transparent hydrophobic association hydrogel can confer synergetic optimization among multiple performance indexes essential for keratoprostheses, where the morphology is kinetically arrested via glass transition under isochoric conditions. Such a process can mediate porous structure at &#8776;100 nm, rendering a combination of multiple desired properties that equal or surpass those of current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art keratoprostheses.








Abstract
Corneal transplantation is impeded by donor shortages, immune rejection, and ethical reservations. Pre&#8208;made cornea prostheses (keratoprostheses) offer a proven option to alleviate these issues. Ideal keratoprostheses must possess optical clarity and mechanical robustness, but also high permeability, processability, and recyclability. Here, it is shown that rationally controlling the extent of arrested phase separation can lead to optimized multiscale structure that reconciles permeability and transparency, a previously conflicting goal by common pore&#8208;forming strategies. The process is simply accomplished by hydrothermally treating a dense and transparent hydrophobic association hydrogel. The examination of multiscale structure evolution during hydrothermal treatment reveals that the phase separation with upper miscibility gap evolves to confer time&#8208;dependent pore growth due to slow dynamics of polymer&#8208;rich phase which is close to vitrification. Such a process can render a combination of multiple desired properties that equal or surpass those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art keratoprostheses. In vivo tests confirm that the keratoprosthesis can effectively repair corneal perforation and restore a transparent cornea with treatment outcomes akin to that of allo&#8208;keratoplasty. The keratoprosthesis is&#160;easy to access and convenient to carry, and thus would be an effective temporary substitute for a corneal allograft in emergency conditions.

         <title>Tunable Mesoscopic Collagen Island Architectures Modulate Stem Cell Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collagen&#8208;I&#8208;based hydrogel system that mimics physiologically relevant tissue architectures is developed, called collagen islands. These island hydrogels are facile to generate by modulating the&#160;shearing frequency and have tunable architectures and mechanical properties. It is found that the&#160;island architecture is able to modulate osteogenic commitment in mesenchymal stem cells and mesodermal differentiation in pluripotent stem cells.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix is the biophysical environment that scaffolds mammalian cells in the body. The main constituent is collagen. In physiological tissues, collagen network topology is diverse with complex mesoscopic features. While studies have explored the roles of collagen density and stiffness, the impact of complex architectures remains not well&#8208;understood. Developing in vitro systems that recapitulate these diverse collagen architectures is critical for understanding physiologically relevant cell behaviors. Here, methods are developed to induce the formation of heterogeneous mesoscopic architectures, referred to as collagen islands, in collagen hydrogels. These island&#8208;containing gels have highly tunable inclusions and mechanical properties. Although these gels are globally soft, there is regional enrichment in the collagen concentration at the cell&#8208;scale. Collagen&#8208;island architectures are utilized to study mesenchymal stem cell behavior, and it is demonstrated that cell migration and osteogenic differentiation are altered. Finally, induced pluripotent stem cells are cultured in island&#8208;containing gels, and it is shown that the architecture is sufficient to induce mesodermal differentiation. Overall, this work highlights complex mesoscopic tissue architectures as bioactive cues in regulating cell behavior and presents a novel collagen&#8208;based hydrogel that captures these features for tissue engineering applications.

         <title>All&#8208;Printed Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Perovskite Photovoltaics Enabled by Solution&#8208;Processed Carbon Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new conductive carbon electrode ink is developed specifically for compatibility with a low&#8208;temperature perovskite device stack. Filling a crucial gap in the ability to mass manufacture highly efficient perovskite photovoltaics and achieving a stabilized efficiency of 10.8%, all layers of the device stack including the electrode are roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll slot&#8208;die coated.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics have shown great promise in device efficiency but also the promise of scalability through solution&#8208;processed manufacture. Efforts to scale perovskites have been taken&#160;through printable mesoporous scaffolds and slot die coating of flexible substrates roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R). However, to date there has been no demonstration of entirely R2R&#8208;coated devices due to the lack of a compatible solution&#8208;processable back electrode; instead,&#160;high&#8208;value evaporated metal contacts are employed as a post process. Here, in this study, the combination of a low&#8208;temperature device structure and R2R&#8208;compatible solution formulations is employed to make a fully R2R printable device architecture overcoming interlayer incompatibilities and recombination losses. Therefore, the n&#8211;i&#8211;p device structure of SnO2/perovskite/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)/carbon is employed to form an ohmic contact between a p&#8208;type semiconductor and printable carbon electrode. In particular, the results show that the small&#8208;scale device efficiencies of 13&#8211;14% are achieved, matching the device performance of evaporated gold electrodes. Also, this entirely R2R&#8208;coated perovskite prototype represents a game changer, reaching over 10% (10.8) stabilized power conversion efficiency with unencapsulated long&#8208;term stability retaining 84% of its original efficiency over 1000 h under 70% RH and 25 &#176;C.

         <title>Rapid Data&#8208;Efficient Optimization of Perovskite Nanocrystal Syntheses through Machine Learning Algorithm Fusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing and optimizing novel, efficient nanomaterials for renewable energies is arduous; however, machine learning can support this process. Here, three machine&#8208;learning algorithms are merged with Bayesian optimization to significantly improve halide perovskite nanoplatelets&#8217; homogeneity and optical properties. Significantly, the algorithm fusion results in a data&#8208;efficient pipeline, requiring an order of magnitude fewer syntheses than previous methods to function proficiently.








Abstract
With the demand for renewable energy and efficient devices rapidly increasing, a need arises to find and optimize novel (nano)materials. With sheer limitless possibilities for material combinations and synthetic procedures, obtaining novel, highly functional materials has been a tedious trial and error process. Recently, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to help optimize syntheses; however, most approaches require a substantial amount of input data, limiting their pertinence. Here, three well&#8208;known machine&#8208;learning models are merged with Bayesian optimization into one to optimize the synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with limited data demand. The algorithm can accurately predict the photoluminescence emission maxima of nanoplatelet dispersions using only the three precursor ratios as input parameters. This allows us to fabricate previously unobtainable seven and eight monolayer&#8208;thick nanoplatelets. Moreover, the algorithm dramatically improves the homogeneity of 2&#8211;6&#8208;monolayer&#8208;thick nanoplatelet dispersions, as evidenced by narrower and more symmetric photoluminescence spectra. Decisively, only 200 total syntheses are required to achieve this vast improvement, highlighting how rapidly material properties can be optimized. The algorithm is highly versatile and can incorporate additional synthetic parameters. Accordingly, it is readily applicable to other less&#8208;explored nanocrystal syntheses and can help rapidly identify and improve exciting compositions&#8217; quality.

Fe&#8208;intercalated Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 single crystals (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.15) are grown successfully. The Fe intercalation significantly tunes the structural instability and brings about exotic electronic properties for the Weyl semimetal MoTe2, including the first observed Kondo effect and spin&#8208;glass transition in its topologically nontrivial Td phase at low temperature.








Abstract
Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2 has recently attracted much attention due to its intriguing electronic properties and potential applications in spintronics. Here, Fe&#8208;intercalated Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 single crystals (0 &lt; x&#160;&lt; 0.15 ) are grown successfully. The electrical and thermoelectric transport results consistently demonstrate that the phase transition temperature TS is gradually suppressed with increasing x. Theoretical calculation suggests that the increased energy of the Td phase, enhanced transition barrier, and more occupied bands in 1T&#8242; phase is responsible for the suppression in TS. In addition, a &#961;&#945;&#8211;lnT behavior induced by Kondo effect is observed with x &#8805; 0.08, due to the coupling between conduction carriers and the local magnetic moments of intercalated Fe atoms. For Td&#8208;Fe0.15MoTe2, a spin&#8208;glass transition occurs at &#8776;10 K. The calculated band structure of Td&#8208;Fe0.25MoTe2 shows that two flat bands exist near the Fermi level, which are mainly contributed by the dyz and dx2&#8722;y2${{\rm{d}}_{{x^2} - {y^2}}}$ orbitals of the Fe atoms. Finally, the electronic phase diagram of Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 is established for the first time. This work provides a new route to control the structural instability and explore exotic electronic states for transition&#8208;metal&#160;dichalcogenides.

         <title>Exsolution Modeling and Control to Improve the Catalytic Activity of Nanostructured Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusion&#8208;determined exsolution behavior and its mechanism are demonstrated by controlling and modeling particle growth. Following this model, a highly active and durable nanostructured electrode for solid oxide fuel cells using an in situ exsolution method is developed. The particle growth of the exsolved Ni nanoparticles is enhanced by electrochemical switching,leading to a drastic improvement in cell performance.








Abstract
In situ exsolution for nanoscale electrode design has attracted considerable attention because of its promising activity and high stability. However, fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying particle growth remains insufficient. Herein, cation&#8208;diffusion&#8208;determined exsolution is presented using an analytical model based on classical nucleation and diffusion. In the designed perovskite system, the exsolution trend for particle growth is consistent with this diffusion model, which strongly depends on the initial cation concentration and reduction conditions. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, a highly Ni&#8208;doped anode and an electrochemical switching technique are employed to promote exsolution and overcome growth limitations. The optimal cell exhibits an outstanding maximum power density of 1.7&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 900&#160;&#176;C and shows no evident degradation when operating at 800&#160;&#176;C for 240&#160;h under wet H2. This study provides crucial insights into the developing and tuning of heterogeneous catalysts for energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Ceria Nanoparticles as Copper Chaperones that Activate SOD1 for Synergistic Antioxidant Therapy to Treat Ischemic Vascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ceria nanoparticles deposited with copper ions, cofactors for the indigenous antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), are synthesized for effective and synergistic antioxidant therapy to treat ischemic vascular diseases in which the imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) aggravates the tissue damage. Ceria nanoparticles chaperone copper ions to elevate the expression of SOD1 to significantly reduce the ROS&#8208;induced damage.








Abstract
All exogenous nanomaterials undergo rapid biotransformation once injected into the body and fall short of executing the intended purpose. Here,&#160;it is reported that copper&#8208;deposited ceria nanoparticles (CuCe NPs) exhibit enhanced antioxidant effects over&#160;pristine ceria nanoparticles, as the released copper buffers the depletion of glutathione while providing the bioavailable copper as a cofactor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1. The upregulated intracellular antioxidants along with the ceria nanoparticles synergistically scavenge reactive oxygen species and promote anti&#8208;inflammation and M2 polarization of macrophages by modulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 6 (STAT1 and STAT6). The therapeutic effect of CuCe NPs is demonstrated in ischemic vascular diseases (i.e., murine models of hindlimb ischemia and myocardial infarction) in which the copper&#8208;deposition affords increased perfusion and alleviation in tissue damage. The results provide rationale that metal oxide nanomaterials can be designed in a way to induce the upregulation of specific biological factors for optimal therapeutic performance.

         <dc:description>
The room&#8208;temperature operation of spin&#8208;valve devices using the van der Waals itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 in heterostructures with graphene is demonstrated. Lateral spin&#8208;valve, Hanle spin precession measurements, and theoretical calculations provide unique insights by probing the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface spintronic properties via spin&#8208;dynamics measurements, revealing multidirectional spin polarization.








Abstract
The discovery of van der Waals (vdW) magnets opened a new paradigm for condensed matter physics and spintronic technologies. However, the operations of active spintronic devices with vdW ferromagnets are limited to cryogenic temperatures, inhibiting their broader practical applications. Here, the robust room&#8208;temperature operation of lateral spin&#8208;valve devices using the vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 in heterostructures with graphene is demonstrated. The room&#8208;temperature spintronic properties of Fe5GeTe2 are measured at the interface with graphene with a negative spin polarization. Lateral spin&#8208;valve and spin&#8208;precession measurements provide unique insights by probing the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface spintronic properties via spin&#8208;dynamics measurements, revealing multidirectional spin polarization. Density functional theory calculations in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations reveal significantly canted Fe magnetic moments in Fe5GeTe2 along with the presence of negative spin polarization at the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface. These findings open opportunities for vdW interface design and applications of vdW&#8208;magnet&#8208;based spintronic devices at ambient temperatures.

         <title>Even&#8211;Odd&#8208;Layer&#8208;Dependent Ferromagnetism in 2D Non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals CrCuSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals 2D CuCrSe2 nanosheets with thickness down to monolayer are produced using a redox&#8208;controlled exfoliation route. Differing from its bulk form with antiferromagnetic order, the CuCrSe2 nanosheets exhibit intriguing even&#8211;odd&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent magnetism evolution, which can be attributed to the orbital shift of Cr layers due to Cu&#8208;induced centrosymmetry breaking.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy have attracted significant interest as the long&#8208;range magnetic order in these systems can survive even when their thicknesses is reduced to the 2D limit. Even though the interlayer coupling between the neighboring magnetic layers is very weak, it has a determining effect on the magnetism of these atomic&#8208;thickness materials. Herein, a new 2D ferromagnetic material, namely, non&#8208;vdW CuCrSe2 nanosheets with even&#8211;odd&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism when laminated from an antiferromagnetic bulk is reported. Monolayer and even&#8208;layer CuCrSe2 exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and a significantly enhanced magnetic ordering temperature of more than 125 K. In contrast, the linear Hall effect exists in the odd&#8208;layer samples. Theoretical calculations indicate that the layer&#8208;dependent magnetic coupling is attributable to the orbital shift of the Cr atoms in the CrSe2 layers owing to the Cu&#8208;induced breaking of the centrosymmetry. Thus, this work sheds light on the exotic magnetic properties of layered materials that exhibit phenomena beyond weak interlayer interactions.

     alt="Even&#8211;Odd-Layer-Dependent Ferromagnetism in 2D Non-van-der-Waals CrCuSe2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-van-der-Waals 2D CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with thickness down to monolayer are produced using a redox-controlled exfoliation route. Differing from its bulk form with antiferromagnetic order, the CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets exhibit intriguing even&#8211;odd-layer-dependent magnetism evolution, which can be attributed to the orbital shift of Cr layers due to Cu-induced centrosymmetry breaking.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy have attracted significant interest as the long-range magnetic order in these systems can survive even when their thicknesses is reduced to the 2D limit. Even though the interlayer coupling between the neighboring magnetic layers is very weak, it has a determining effect on the magnetism of these atomic-thickness materials. Herein, a new 2D ferromagnetic material, namely, non-vdW CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with even&#8211;odd-layer-dependent ferromagnetism when laminated from an antiferromagnetic bulk is reported. Monolayer and even-layer CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and a significantly enhanced magnetic ordering temperature of more than 125 K. In contrast, the linear Hall effect exists in the odd-layer samples. Theoretical calculations indicate that the layer-dependent magnetic coupling is attributable to the orbital shift of the Cr atoms in the CrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers owing to the Cu-induced breaking of the centrosymmetry. Thus, this work sheds light on the exotic magnetic properties of layered materials that exhibit phenomena beyond weak interlayer interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A functional electroluminescent molecular bridge is covalently integrated into nanogapped graphene electrodes to build a high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule light&#8208;emitting diode with unprecedented levels of stability and reproducibility. Precise tunability of its emission efficiency, color purity, linear polarization, emitted photon number, and energy is achieved upon application of electric inputs, rational molecular engineering, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, affording a new practical single&#8208;photon emitter.








Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule light&#8208;emitting diode (SM&#8208;LED) with high color purity, linear polarization, and efficiency tunability is prepared by covalently integrating one fluorescent molecule into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Furthermore, single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the electroluminescent center to different accepters is achieved through rational molecular engineering, enabling construction of a multicolor SM&#8208;LED. All these characterizations are accomplished in the photoelectrical integration system with high temporal/spatial/energy resolution, demonstrating the capability of the single&#8208;photon emission of SM&#8208;LEDs. The success in developing high&#8208;performance SM&#8208;LEDs inspires the development of the next generation of commercial display devices and promises a single&#8208;photon emitter for use in quantum computation and quantum communication.

         <title>Efficient and Robust Molecular Solar Thermal Fabric for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOST fabric with high energy&#8208;storage capacity and robustness is demonstrated for personal thermal management (PTM). Based on a MOST microcapsule with deep&#8208;UV&#8208;filter shell and encapsulated azopyrazole molecules, the MOST fabric displays ideal energy&#8208;storage density up to 2.5&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 and high robustness in rechargeability, washing, and rubbing.








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal (MOST) materials, which can efficiently capture solar energy and release it as heat on demand, are promising candidates for future personal thermal management (PTM) applications, preferably in the form of fabrics. However, developing MOST fabrics with high energy&#8208;storage capacity and stable working performance remains a significant challenge because of the low energy density of the molecular materials and their leakage from the fabric. Here, an efficient and robust MOST fabric for PTM using azopyrazole&#8208;containing microcapsules with a deep&#8208;UV&#8208;filter shell is reported. The MOST fabric, which can co&#8208;harvest solar and thermal energy, achieves efficient photocharging and photo&#8208;discharging (&gt;90% photoconversion), a high energy density of 2.5&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2, and long&#8208;term storage sustainability at month scale. Moreover, it can undergo multiple cycles of washing, rubbing, and recharging without significant loss of energy&#8208;storage capacity. This MOST microcapsule strategy is easily used for the scalable production of a MOST fabric for solar thermal moxibustion. This achievement offers a promising route for the application of wearable MOST materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance and robustness in PTM.

         <title>Funnel Devices Based on Asymmetrically Strained Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Funnel devices are developed using WS2 and MoS2 transferred onto a fork&#8208;shaped SU&#8208;8 microstructure. Atomic force microscope, Raman, and photoluminescence measurements indicate that asymmetric strains are introduced to the transferred transition metal dichalcogenides. The scanning photocurrent mapping images acquired from various funnel devices follow a fork&#8208;shaped pattern, demonstrating that funneled excitons can be converted to electrical currents.








Abstract
The strain applied to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) reduces their energy bandgap, and local strains result in a funnel&#8208;like band structure in which funneled excitons move toward the most strained region. Herein, a funnel device based on asymmetrically strained WS2 and MoS2 is reported. Asymmetric strains are induced by transferring the TMD flakes onto a fork&#8208;shaped SU&#8208;8 microstructure. Raman and photoluminescence spectra peaks are shifted according to the morphology of the SU&#8208;8 microstructure, indicating the application of asymmetric strains to the TMDs. To investigate whether funneled excitons can be converted to electrical currents, various devices are constructed by depositing symmetric and asymmetric electrodes onto the strained TMDs. The scanning photocurrent mapping images follow a fork&#8208;shaped pattern, indicating probable conversion of the funneled excitons into electrical currents. In the case of the funnel devices with asymmetric Au and Al electrodes, short&#8208;circuit current (ISC) of WS2 is enhanced by the strains, whereas ISC of MoS2 is suppressed because the Schottky barrier lowers with increasing strain for the MoS2. These results demonstrate that the funnel devices can be implemented using asymmetrically strained TMDs and the effect of strains on the Schottky barrier is dependent on the TMD used.

         <title>Transformation from Magnetic Soliton to Skyrmion in a Monoaxial Chiral Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction determines the formation of single&#8208;twisted magnetic solitons (e.g., CrNb3S6) or multi&#8208;twisted magnetic skyrmions (e.g., FeGe) in chiral magnets with different crystallographic symmetries. A topological phase transition from magnetic solitons to elongated skyrmions is observed in a geometrically&#160;confined nanostripe of monoaxial CrNb3S6&#160;crystals, in which the magnetic dipolar interactions play a key role.








Abstract
Topological spin textures are of great interest for both fundamental physics and applications in spintronics. The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction underpins the formation of single&#8208;twisted magnetic solitons or multi&#8208;twisted magnetic skyrmions in magnetic materials with different crystallographic symmetries. However, topological transitions between these two kinds of topological objects have not been verified experimentally. Here, the direct observation of transformations from a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) to magnetic skyrmions in a nanostripe of the monoaxial chiral magnet CrNb3S6&#160;using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy is reported. In the presence of an external magnetic field, helical spin structures first transform into CSLs and then evolve into isolated elongated magnetic skyrmions. The detailed spin textures of the elongated magnetic skyrmions are resolved using off&#8208;axis electron holography and are shown to comprise two merons, which enclose their ends and have unit total topological charge. Magnetic dipolar interactions are shown to play a key role in the magnetic soliton&#8211;skyrmion transformation, which depends sensitively on nanostripe width. The findings here, which are consistent with micromagnetic simulations, enrich the family of topological magnetic states and their transitions and promise to further stimulate the exploration of their emergent electromagnetic properties.

         <title>Regenerative Living 4D Printing via Reversible Growth of Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is inspired by an &#8220;immortal&#8221; jellyfish, Turritopsis nutricula. A mature T. nutricula has the ability to rejuvenate under unusual circumstances. A regenerative living 4D printable material system is designed. After printing, the printed seed with complex geometries can not only grow by absorbing external monomers (nutrients), but also degrow to its original seed state.








Abstract
Living creatures possess complex geometries, exceptional adaptability, and continuous growing and regenerating characteristics, which are difficult for synthetic materials to imitate simultaneously. A living polymer network with these features is reported. The polymer can be digitally printed into arbitrary 3D shapes and subsequently undergoes growth via living polymerization of a monomer as the nutrient. This leads to macroscopic dimensional growth and transforms the printed amorphous network into a crystallizable network, resulting in geometric adaptability via a shape&#8208;memory mechanism. By controlling the localized growth, an initial homogeneous structure can be converted into a geometrically different heterogeneous structure composed of materials with different properties (crystallization and mechanical properties). After growth, the original network can be chemically regenerated for regrowth. With this regenerative living 4D printing, one 3D&#8208;printed seed template can be turned into different derivatives with distinct geometries and mechanical properties when repeated regeneration is conducted in different localized regions and the degree of regrowth is varied.

         <title>Building K&#8211;C Anode with Ultrahigh Self&#8208;Diffusion Coefficient for Solid State Potassium Metal Batteries Operating at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin K&#8211;10% reduced graphene oxide anode is constructed, delivering promoted K diffusion kinetics and mechanical/thermal stability at 200&#160;&#176;C, which creates an interfacial resistance (&#8776;1.3 &#937; cm2) with a current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 25&#160;&#176;C and an areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&#8722;2, enabling solid state potassium metal batteries operating at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Solid state potassium (K) metal batteries are intriguing in grid&#8208;scale energy storage, benefiting from the low cost, safety, and high energy density. However, their practical applications are impeded by poor K/solid electrolyte (SE) interfacial contact and limited capacity caused by the low K self&#8208;diffusion coefficient, dendrite growth, and intrinsically low melting point/soft features of metallic K. Herein, a fused&#8208;modeling strategy using potassiophilic carbon allotropes molted with K is demonstrated that can enhance the electrochemical performance/stability of the system via promoting K diffusion kinetics (2.37 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1), creating a low interfacial resistance (&#8776;1.3 &#937; cm2), suppressing dendrite growth, and maintaining mechanical/thermal stability at 200&#160;&#176;C. A homogeneous/stable K stripping/plating is consequently implemented with a high current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (at 25&#160;&#176;C) and a record&#8208;high areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&#8722;2 (at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). The enhanced K diffusion kinetics contribute to sustaining intimate interfacial contact, stabilizing the stripping/plating at high current densities. Full cells coupling ultrathin K&#8211;C composite anodes (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;m) with Prussian blue cathodes and &#946;/&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 SEs deliver a high energy density of 389&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with a retention of 94.4% after 150 cycles and fantastic performances at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Compressible Polymer Composites with Enhanced Dielectric Temperature Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing a microscale interconnected ferroelectric scaffold with a dielectric transition layer, relative dielectric constant close to the parallel model, as well as excellent mechanical compliance, are realized in polymer composites. An artificially designed composite ceramic scaffold with a compositional gradient enables the composite display high dielectric temperature stability within wide temperature ranges, offering a new approach for designing high&#8208;performance flexible dielectrics.








Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant polymer composites have broad application prospects in flexible electronics and electrostatic energy storage capacitors. Substantial enhancement in dielectric constants (&#949;r) of polymer composites so far can only be obtained at a high loading of nanofillers, resulting in high dielectric loss and high elastic modulus of polymer composites. Addressing the polarization shielding and the consequent polarization discontinuity at polymer/filler interfaces has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to achieve flexible polymer composite with high &#949;r. Herein, a polymer composite with interconnected BaTiO3 (BT) ceramic scaffold is proposed and demonstrated, which exhibits a high &#949;r of &#8776;210 at a low BT volume fraction of &#8776;18&#160;vol%, approaching the upper limit predicted by the parallel model. By incorporating relaxor Ba(ZrxTi1&#8722;x)O3 phase in BT scaffold, dielectric temperature stability is further achieved with &#916;&#949;r below &#177;10% within a broad temperature range (25&#8211;140&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the dielectric performances remain stable under a compressive strain of up to 80%. This work provides a facile approach to construct large&#8208;scale polymer composites with robust dielectric performance against changes in thermal and mechanical conditions, which are promising for high&#8208;temperature applications in flexible electronics.

         <title>Fracture Detection in Bio&#8208;Glues with Fluorescent&#8208;Protein&#8208;Based Optical Force Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ratiometric protein optical force probes is designed and used to fabricate force&#8208;sensitive bio&#8208;glue. The visualization of stress concentrations, monitoring of fracture zones, and identification of adhesive or cohesive failure are achieved by fluorescence spectroscopy and lifetime imaging microscopy.








Abstract
Glues are being used to bond, seal, and repair in industry and biomedicine. The improvement of gluing performance is hence important for the development of new glues with better and balanced property spaces, which in turn necessitates a mechanistic understanding of their mechanical failure. Optical force probes (OFPs) allow the observation of mechanical material damage in polymers from the macro&#8208; down to the microscale, yet have never been employed in glues. Here, the development of a series of ratiometric OFPs based on fluorescent&#8208;protein&#8211;dye and protein&#8211;protein conjugates and their incorporation into genetically engineered bio&#8208;glues is reported. The OFPs are designed to efficiently modulate F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#160;upon force application thereby reporting on force&#8208;induced molecular alterations independent of concentration and fluorescence intensity both spectrally and through their fluorescence lifetime. By fluorescence spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state and by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, stress concentrations are visualized and adhesive and cohesive failure in the fracture zone is differentiated.

         <title>Strong&#8208;Proton&#8208;Adsorption Co&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts Achieve Active and Stable Neutral Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct electrolysis of pH&#8208;neutral seawater is not only a promising approach to produce clean hydrogen energy, but also of great significance to seawater desalination. Now, both the simulations and experimental characterizations illustrate that incorporating the strong&#8208;proton&#8208;adsorption cations into Co3O4 can increase the rate&#8208;determining water dissociation step and achieve industrially required current density of &gt;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in natural seawater.








Abstract
Direct electrolysis of pH&#8208;neutral seawater to generate hydrogen is an attractive approach for storing renewable energy. However, due to the anodic competition between the chlorine evolution and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), direct seawater splitting suffers from a low current density and limited operating stability. Exploration of catalysts enabling an OER overpotential below the hypochlorite formation overpotential (&#8776;490&#160;mV) is critical to suppress the chloride evolution and facilitate seawater splitting. Here, a proton&#8208;adsorption&#8208;promoting strategy to increase the OER rate is reported, resulting in a promoted and more stable neutral seawater splitting. The best catalysts herein are strong&#8208;proton&#8208;adsorption (SPA) materials such as palladium&#8208;doped cobalt oxide (Co3&#8211;xPdxO4) catalysts. These achieve an OER overpotential of 370&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in pH&#8208;neutral simulated seawater, outperforming Co3O4 by a margin of 70&#160;mV. Co3&#8211;xPdxO4 catalysts provide stable catalytic performance for 450&#160;h at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 20&#160;h at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in neutral seawater. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of SPA cations accelerates the rate&#8208;determining water dissociation step in neutral OER pathway, and control studies rule out the provision of additional OER sites as a main factor herein.

         <title>Sulfide&#8208;Bridged Covalent Quinoxaline Frameworks for Lithium&#8211;Organosulfide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox activity of covalent sulfide bridging and chelating ability of quinoxaline nodes in covalent organic frameworks offer dual active sites for a novel lithium&#8211;organosulfide battery. This shows negligible polysulfide shuttle in comparison with typical sulfur cathodes in the lithium&#8211;sulfur battery. Experimental and computational elucidation indicate a reversible mechanism.








Abstract
The chelating ability of quinoxaline cores and the redox activity of organosulfide bridges in layered covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer dual active sites for reversible lithium (Li)&#8208;storage. The designed COFs combining these properties feature disulfide and polysulfide&#8208;bridged networks showcasing an intriguing Li&#8208;storage mechanism, which can be considered as a lithium&#8211;organosulfide (Li&#8211;OrS) battery. The experimental&#8211;computational elucidation of three quinoxaline COFs containing systematically enhanced sulfur atoms in sulfide bridging demonstrates fast kinetics during Li interactions with the quinoxaline core. Meanwhile, bilateral covalent bonding of sulfide bridges to the quinoxaline core enables a redox&#8208;mediated reversible cleavage of the sulfur&#63743;sulfur bond and the formation of covalently anchored lithium&#8211;sulfide chains or clusters during Li&#8208;interactions, accompanied by a marked reduction of Li&#8211;polysulfide (Li&#8211;PS) dissolution into the electrolyte, a frequent drawback of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. The electrochemical behavior of model compounds mimicking the sulfide linkages of the COFs and operando Raman studies on the framework structure unravels the reversibility of the profound Li&#8208;ion&#8211;organosulfide interactions. Thus, integrating redox&#8208;active organic&#8208;framework materials with covalently anchored sulfides enables a stable Li&#8211;OrS battery mechanism which shows benefits over a typical Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Conversion of Silicon Nitride Nanopore&#160;to Nanonet for Single&#8208;Protein Trapping Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;state nanonet sensing platform made via&#160;light irradiation of a silicon nitride nanopore&#160;enables single&#8208;protein analysis. As a model protein, bovine serum albumin produces collision and trapping flipping signals on the nanonet, providing more structural information than traditional nanopore sensing. Additionally, the nanonet allows for capture of the real&#8208;time UV&#8208;induced structure changes of the protein.








Abstract
The single&#8208;molecule technique for investigation of an unlabeled protein in solution is very attractive but with great challenges. Nanopore sensing as a label&#8208;free tool can be used for collecting the structural information of individual proteins, but currently offers only limited capabilities due to the fast translocation of the target. Here, a reliable and facile method is developed to convert the silicon nitride nanopore to a stable nanonet platform for single&#8208;entity sensing by electrophoretic or electroosmotic trapping. A nanonet is fabricated based on a material reorganization process caused by electron&#8208;beam and light&#8208;irradiation treatment. Using protein molecules as a model, it is revealed that the solid&#8208;state nanonet can produce collision and trapping flipping signals of the protein, which provides more structural information than traditional nanopore sensing. More importantly, thanks to the excellent stability of the solid&#8208;state silicon nitride nanonet, it is demonstrated that the ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced structural&#8208;change process of an individual protein can be captured. The developed nanonet supplies a robust platform for single&#8208;entity studies but is not limited to proteins.

         <title>Printable Epsilon&#8208;Type Structure Transistor Arrays with Highly Reliable Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) constructed by printed epsilon&#8208;type&#8208;structure indium tin oxide transistor arrays based on a modified coffee&#8208;ring structure are achieved, performing with near&#8208;ideal entropy, uniqueness, reliability, and low power consumption. Additionally, the PUFs are secure against powerful machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based attacks without any postprocessing. The printed epsilon&#8208;type structured transistor provides a printable, simple strategy for high&#8208;equality and large&#8208;scale hardware secure primitive.








Abstract
Printed electronics promises to drive the future data&#8208;intensive technologies, with its potential to fabricate novel devices over a large area with low cost on nontraditional substrates. In these emerging technologies, there exists a large digital information flow, which requires secure communication and authentication. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) offer a promising built&#8208;in hardware&#8208;security system comparable to biometrical data, which can be constructed by device&#8208;specific intrinsic variations in the additive manufacturing process of active devices. However, printed PUFs typically exploit the inherent variation in layer thickness and roughness of active devices. The current in devices with enough significant changes to increase the robustness to external environment noise is still a challenge. Here, printable epsilon&#8208;type&#8208;structure indium tin oxide transistor arrays are demonstrated to construct high&#8208;reliability PUFs by modifying the coffee&#8208;ring structure. The epsilon&#8208;type structure improves the printing scalability, film quality, and device reliability. Furthermore, the print&#8208;induced uncertainty along the channel thickness and length can lead to changes in the carrier concentration. Notably, the randomly distributed printing droplets in a small area significantly increase this uncertainty. As a result, the PUFs exhibit near&#8208;ideal uniformity, uniqueness, randomness, and reliability. Additionally, the PUFs are resilient against machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based attacks with a prediction accuracy of only 55% without postprocessing.

         <title>Exciton Manipulation for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Wrinkled 2D Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local variation of strain in atomically thin wrinkled 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#160; generates a laterally varying band structure, which&#160;manipulates the exciton generation and dissociation mechanism and enhances its photoelectrochemical performance with a reduced Tafel value of 49&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 outperforming planar 2D catalysts.








Abstract
2D materials&#8217; junctions have demonstrated capabilities as metal&#8208;free alternatives for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To date, the HER has been limited to heterojunctions of different compositions or band structures. Here, the potential of local strain modulation based on wrinkled 2D heterostructures is demonstrated, which&#160;helps&#160;to realize photoelectrocatalytically active junctions. By forming regions of high and low tensile strain in wrinkled WS2 monolayers, local modification of their band structure and internal electric field due to piezoelectricity is realized in the lateral direction. This structure produces efficient electron&#8211;hole pair generation due to light trapping and exciton funneling toward the crest of the WS2 wrinkles and enhances exciton separation. Additionally, the formation of wrinkles induces an air gap in&#8208;between the 2D layer and substrate, which reduces the interfacial scattering effect and consequently improves the charge&#8208;carrier mobility. A detailed study of the strain&#8208;dependence of the photocatalytic HER process demonstrates&#160;a 2&#8208;fold decrease in the Tafel slope and a 30&#8208;fold enhancement in exchange current density. Finally, optimization of the light absorption through functionalization with quantum dots produces unprecedented photoelectrocatalytic performance and provides a route toward the scalable formation of strain&#8208;modulated WS2 nanojunctions for future green energy generation.

         <title>Hydration Activates Dual&#8208;Confined Shape&#8208;Memory Effects of Cold&#8208;Reprogrammable Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The water&#8208;activated dual confined shape&#8208;memory effects (CSMEs) of cold&#8208;programmable photonic crystals are revealed, manifesting ethanol&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered selective shape recovery resulting from water&#8208;induced interchain H&#8208;bonds reconstruction and structural color locking derived from pressure&#8208;guided interchain H&#8208;bonds remodeling. Activatable CSME contributes to the expansion of nanophotonic technology in water printing, erasable watermarks, signal amplifiers, and information coding.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;memory photonic crystals (SMPCs) transform the nanoscale deformation of copolymers into structural color through an undifferentiated response to stimuli; however, activatable selective responses are extremely rare. Herein, activatable dual confined shape&#8208;memory effects (CSMEs) derived from the remodeling of the interchain hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) in cold&#8208;programmable SMPCs are revealed. The first level is the water&#8208;triggered reconstruction&#160;of interchain H&#8208;bonds, which can activate/lock the collapsed skeleton, showing shape recovery/retention in response to ethanol vapor. The second level is the pressure&#8208;induced reorganization of&#160;interchain H&#8208;bonds that results in the recovered skeleton being locked even when exposed to ethanol vapor or water, while the background porous structure can switch between collapse and recovery. Dual CSMEs result from the Laplace pressure difference and the binding effect of interchain H&#8208;bonds in the skeleton according to insights of swelling, in situ deformation tracking, multidimensional infrared spectra, and water wetting/evaporation simulations. The signal interference, source code extraction, and color enhancement of structurally colored patterns can be implemented using CSMEs. This work opens up a new method for fabricating activatable responsive structural color and contributes to the expansion of nanophotonic technology in water printing, erasable watermarks, signal amplifiers, and information coding.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Topological Hall Effect in 2D Cr5Si3 Nanosheets with Noncollinear Magnetic Phase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thickness&#8208;dependent magnetic order in 2D Cr5Si3 nanosheets is herein studied. The thickness&#8208;dependent topological Hall effect and its relation to the observed perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are investigated. At the same time, Cr5Si3 nanosheets that are compatible with the complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#160;technology are synthesized through the chemical vapor deposition setup. It can be used for reference for the growth of other 2D silicides.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin order are expected to exhibit unconventional electromagnetic response, such as spin Hall effects, chiral abnormal, quantum Hall effect, and topological Hall effect. Here, 2D thickness&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;quality Cr5Si3 nanosheets that are compatible with the complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition method. The angular dependence of electromagnetic transport properties of Cr5Si3 nanosheets is investigated using a physical property measurement system, and an obvious topological Hall effect (THE) appears at a large tilted magnetic field, which results from the noncollinear magnetic structure of the Cr5Si3 nanosheet. The Cr5Si3 nanosheets exhibit distinct thickness&#8208;dependent perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and the THE only emerges in the specific thickness range with moderate PMA. This work provides opportunities for exploring fundamental spin&#8208;related physical mechanisms of noncollinear antiferromagnet in ultrathin limit.

         <title>A Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Biomimetic Nanoplatform Enhances Anti&#8208;Leukemia Immunity via Synchronizing DNA Demethylation and RNA Hypermethylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based biomimetic nanoplatform as a &#8220;nano&#8208;epidrug&#8221; (AFMMB) is synthesized for improving anti&#8208;leukemia immunity via dual targeting of DNA and RNA methylation. AFMMB selectively targets leukemic cells and induces autophagy. AFMMB increases the antigenicity of leukemia cells via upregulation of MHC&#8208;I and downregulation of PD&#8208;L1, which in turn enhances their recognition and killing by T cells.








Abstract
Epigenetic&#8208;alterations&#8208;mediated antigenicity reducing in leukemic blasts (LBs) is one of the critical mechanisms of immune escape and resistance to T&#8208;cell&#8208;based immunotherapy. Herein, a bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based biomimetic nanoplatform (termed as AFMMB) that consists of a DNA hypomethylating agent, a leukemia stem cell (LSC) membrane, and pro&#8208;autophagic peptide is fabricated. These AFMMB particles selectively target not only LBs but also LSCs due to the homing effect and immune compatibility of the LSC membrane, and induce autophagy by binding to the Golgi&#8208;apparatus&#8208;associated protein. The autophagy&#8208;triggered dissolution of AFMMB releases active components, resulting in the restoration of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway by inhibiting DNA methylation, upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class&#8208;I molecules, and induction of RNA&#8208;methylation&#8208;mediated decay of programmed cell death protein ligand transcripts. These dual epigenetic changes eventually enhance T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immune response due to increased antigenicity of leukemic cells. AFMMB also can suppress growth and metastases of solid tumor, which&#160;was&#160;suggestive of a pan&#8208;cancer effect. These findings demonstrate that AFMMB may serve as a promising new nanoplatform for dual epigenetic therapy against cancer and warrants clinical validation.

A strong interlayer&#8208;coupled WSe2/WSe2 homostructure is grown by chemical vapor deposition&#160;using a heteroatom&#8208;assisted approach to overcome the stacking&#8208;free energy, showing a uniform moir&#233; superlattice and strong interfacial coupling. The interlayer coupling can be adjusted by altering the twist angle, enabling the investigation of a variety of novel physical phenomena, which is expected to realize single&#8208;photon emission and promote the development of coherent quantum light emitters.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices in twisted van der Waals materials offer a powerful platform for exploring light&#8211;matter interactions. The periodic moir&#233; potentials in moir&#233; superlattices can induce strongly correlated quantum phenomena that depend on the moir&#233; potential associated with interlayer coupling at the interface. However, moir&#233; superlattices are primarily prepared by mechanical exfoliation and manual stacking, where the transfer methods easily cause interfacial contamination, and the preparation of high&#8208;quality bilayer 2D materials with small twist angles by growth methods remains a significant challenge. In this work, WSe2/WSe2 homobilayers with different twist angles by chemical vapor deposition (CVD),&#160;using a heteroatom&#8208;assisted growth technique, are synthesized. Using low&#8208;frequency Raman scattering, the uniformity of the moir&#233; superlattices is mapped to demonstrate the strong interfacial coupling of the CVD&#8208;fabricated twist&#8208;angle homobilayers. The moir&#233; potential depths of the CVD&#8208;grown and artificially stacked homostructures with twist angles of 1.5&#176; are 115 and 45 meV (an increase of 155%), indicating that the depth of moir&#233; potential can be modulated by the interfacial coupling. These results open a new avenue to study the modulation of moir&#233; potential by strong interlayer coupling and provide a foundation for the development of twistronics.

         <dc:description>
The ionic covalent organic framework with moderate&#8208;length spacer exhibits the highest through&#8208;plane proton conductivity attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8211;SO3H groups.








Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering of covalent organic frameworks as advanced ion conductors is a critical issue to be explored. Herein, ionic covalent organic framework membranes (iCOFMs) with spacer&#8208;engineered ionic channel are de novo designed and prepared. The ionic channels are decorated with side chains comprising spacers having different carbon chain lengths and the &#8211;SO3H groups at the end. Attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8211;SO3H groups, the iCOFM with moderate&#8208;length spacer exhibit the highest through&#8208;plane proton conductivity of 889 mS cm&#8208;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>An In&#160;Situ Fabricated Graphene/Bipolar Polymer Hybrid Material Delivers Ultralong Cycle Life over 15&#160;000 Cycles as a High&#8208;Performance Electrode Material</title>

         <dc:description>
A graphene/bipolar polymer hybrid material (Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG) is in&#160;situ fabricated through a simple one&#8208;step solvothermal method. The Fc&#8208;DAB component provides high capacity and stability, while the 3D interconnected conductive graphene network endows Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG with fast ions/electrons diffusion and thus improved rate performance. Therefore, combined together, the material exhibits simultaneously high capacity, ultralong cycle life, and superior rate performance.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials are promising for the future energy storage systems owing to their tunable structures, abundant resources, and environmental friendliness. Many advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries with organic electrodes have been developed and show excellent performance. However, developing organic materials with overall superior performance still faces great challenges, such as low capacity, poor stability, inferior conductivity, and low utilization of active sites. To address these issues, a bipolar polymer (Fc&#8208;DAB) is designed and further polymerized in&#160;situ with three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3DG), offering a hybrid material (Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG) with a variety of merits. Fc&#8208;DAB possesses stable polymer backbone and multiple redox&#8208;active sites that can improve stability and capacity simultaneously. The embedded highly conductive 3DG network endows Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG with stable conductive framework, large surface area, and porous morphology all together, so the fast diffusion of ions/electrons can be achieved, leading to high utilization of active sites and enhanced electrochemical performance. As a result, Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG cathode delivers capacity of &#8776;260&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 25&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, ultra&#8208;long cycle life over 15&#160;000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 with retention of 99.999% per cycle, and remarkable rate performance. The quasi&#8208;solid Li&#8208;metal battery and full cell fabricated using this material also exhibit superior electrochemical performance.

         <title>Manipulating Polymer Backbone Configuration via Halogenated Asymmetric End&#8208;Groups Enables Over 18% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two analogous asymmetric polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors of PYFCl&#8208;T and PYF&amp;PYCl&#8208;T are synthesized based on small&#8208;molecule acceptors with different halogenated end groups to explore their effects on the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The ternary all&#8208;PSC based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT:PYFCl&#8208;T reaches a high power conversion efficiency of 18.12%, benefitting from the miscibility&#8208;driven optimization of active layer morphology by asymmetric PYFCl&#8208;T.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) deeply rely on the joint contributions of desirable optical absorption, adaptive energy levels, and appropriate morphology. Herein, two structural analogous polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (PSMAs), PYFCl&#8208;T and PYF&amp;PYCl&#8208;T, are synthesized, and then incorporated into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT binary blends to construct ternary all&#8208;PSCs. Due to the superior compatibility of PY&#8208;IT and PYFCl&#8208;T, the&#160;ternary all&#8208;PSC based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT:PYFCl&#8208;T with 10 wt% PYFCl&#8208;T, presents higher and more balanced charge mobility, suppressed charge recombination, and faster charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, resulting in an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.12% with enhanced Jsc and FF, which is much higher than that (PCE of 16.09%) of the binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Besides, the ternary all&#8208;PSCs also exhibit improved photostability. The conspicuous performance enhancement principally should give the credit to the miscibility&#8208;driven phase optimization of the donor and acceptor. These findings highlight the significance of polymer&#8208;backbone configuration modulation of PSMAs in morphology optimization toward boosting the device properties of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Fluid Flow Templating of Polymeric Soft Matter with Diverse Morphologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile nanofabrication processes, where liquid flow templates polymer solvent&#8211;nonsolvent precipitation, can produce at least 12&#160;distinct soft matter morphologies at micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale. These structures range from spheroids, rods, fibers, ribbons, and dendricolloids, to sheets. Systematic understanding of fluid templating enables robust control over the resulting micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;structures, which can be produced from a broad variety of (bio) polymers.








Abstract
It is challenging&#160;to find a conventional nanofabrication technique that can consistently produce soft polymeric matter of high surface area and nanoscale morphology in a way that is scalable, versatile, and easily tunable. Here, the capabilities of a universal method for fabricating diverse nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale morphologies based on polymer precipitation templated by the fluid streamlines in multiphasic flow are explored. It is shown that while the procedure is operationally simple, various combinations of its intertwined mechanisms can controllably and reproducibly lead to the formation of an extraordinary wide range of colloidal morphologies. By systematically investigating the process conditions, 12&#160;distinct classes of polymer micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structures including particles, rods, ribbons, nanosheets, and soft dendritic colloids (dendricolloids) are identified.

     alt="Fluid Flow Templating of Polymeric Soft Matter with Diverse Morphologies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versatile nanofabrication processes, where liquid flow templates polymer solvent&#8211;nonsolvent precipitation, can produce at least 12&#160;distinct soft matter morphologies at micro- and nano-scale. These structures range from spheroids, rods, fibers, ribbons, and dendricolloids, to sheets. Systematic understanding of fluid templating enables robust control over the resulting micro- and macro-structures, which can be produced from a broad variety of (bio) polymers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is challenging&#160;to find a conventional nanofabrication technique that can consistently produce soft polymeric matter of high surface area and nanoscale morphology in a way that is scalable, versatile, and easily tunable. Here, the capabilities of a universal method for fabricating diverse nano- and micro-scale morphologies based on polymer precipitation templated by the fluid streamlines in multiphasic flow are explored. It is shown that while the procedure is operationally simple, various combinations of its intertwined mechanisms can controllably and reproducibly lead to the formation of an extraordinary wide range of colloidal morphologies. By systematically investigating the process conditions, 12&#160;distinct classes of polymer micro- and nano-structures including particles, rods, ribbons, nanosheets, and soft dendritic colloids (dendricolloids) are identified. The outcomes are interpreted by delineating the physical processes into three stages: hydrodynamic shear, capillary and mechanical breakup, and polymer precipitation rate. The insights into the underlying fundamental mechanisms provide guidance toward developing a versatile and scalable nanofabrication platform. It is verified that the liquid shear-based technique is versatile and works well with many chemically diverse polymers and biopolymers, showing potential as a universal tool for simple and scalable nanofabrication of many morphologically distinct soft matter classes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>25.24%&#8208;Efficiency FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Intermolecular Esterification Reaction of DL&#8208;Carnitine Hydrochloride</title>

         <dc:description>
DL&#8208;Carnitine hydrochloride (DL) is incorporated into the perovskite/SnO2 interface for FACsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Oxygen vacancies and Sn&#8208;related defects are concurrently suppressed by the DL, while the DL&#8208;dimer yielded by the intermolecular esterification passivates Pb&#8208;related defects more efficiently than DL. Consequently, a DL&#8208;treated device achieves a record efficiency of 25.24% among all the reported FACsPbI3 PSCs to date.








Abstract
Judicious tailoring of the interface between the SnO2 electron&#8208;transport layer and the perovskite buried surface plays a pivotal role in obtaining highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a DL&#8208;carnitine hydrochloride (DL) is incorporated into the perovskite/SnO2 interface to suppress the defect&#8208;states density. A DL&#8208;dimer is obtained at the interface by an intermolecular esterification reaction. For the SnO2 film, the Cl&#8722; in the DL&#8208;dimer can passivate oxygen vacancies (VO) through electrostatic coupling, while the N in the DL&#8208;dimer can coordinate with the Sn4+ to passivate Sn&#8208;related defects. For the perovskite film, the DL&#8208;dimer can passivate FA+ defects via hydrogen bonding and Pb&#8208;related defects more efficiently than the DL monomer. Upon DL&#8208;dimer modification, the interfacial defects are effectively passivated and the quality of the resultant perovskite film is improved. As a result, the DL&#8208;treated device achieves a gratifying open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.20&#160;V and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.24%, which is a record value among all the reported FACsPbI3 PSCs to date. In addition, the unencapsulated devices exhibit a charming stability, sustaining 99.20% and 90.00% of their initial PCEs after aging in air for 1200&#160;h and continuously operating at the maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Hexaindium Heptasulfide/Nitrogen and Sulfur Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Hollow Microspindles with Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium Storage through Stable Conversion and Alloying Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous and hollow In6S7/nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon microspindles with fast, reversible, and durable Na+&#8208;storage properties can bridge the kinetics gap with capacitive porous carbon, enabling a sodium&#8208;ion capacitor with an energy density up to 136.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a power density up to 47.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1 as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Group IIIA&#8211;VA metal sulfides (GMSs) have attracted increasing attention because of their unique Na&#8208;storage mechanisms through combined conversion and alloying reactions, thus delivering large theoretical capacities and low working potentials. However, Na+ diffusion within GMSs anodes leads to severe volume change, generally representing a fundamental limitation to rate capability and cycling stability. Here, monodispersed In6S7/nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon hollow microspindles (In6S7/NSC HMS) are produced by morphology&#8208;preserved thermal sulfurization of spindle&#8208;like and porous indium&#8208;based metal organic frameworks. The resulting In6S7/NSC HMS anode exhibits theoretical&#8208;value&#8208;close specific capacity (546.2 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), ultrahigh rate capability (267.5&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 30.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8776;93.5%), and &#8776;92.6% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This kinetically favored In6S7/NSC HMS anode fills up the kinetics gap with a capacitive porous carbon cathode, enabling a sodium&#8208;ion capacitor to deliver an ultrahigh energy density of 136.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 47.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1. The in situ/ex situ analytical techniques and theoretical calculation both show that the robust and fast Na+ charge storage of In6S7/NSC HMS arises from the multi&#8208;electron redox mechanism, buffered volume expansion, negligible morphological change, and surface&#8208;controlled solid&#8208;state Na+ transport.

         <title>Bioinspired Liquid Crystalline Spinning Enables Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performing Fibrous Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired spinning technology is reported that allows for continuous, high&#8208;speed production of thin and aligned liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) microfibers combined with rapid deformation, powerful actuation, high response frequency, and long cycle life. This processing technology capable of scalable production of high&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs would benefit the development of smart fabrics, intelligent wearable devices, humanoid robotics, and other areas.








Abstract
Leveraging liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) to realize scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performing fibrous artificial muscles is of particular interest because these active soft materials can provide large, reversible, programmable deformations upon environmental stimuli. High&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs require the used processing technology to enable shaping LCEs into micro&#8208;scale fine fibers as thin as possible while achieving macroscopic LC orientation, which however remains a daunting challenge. Here, a bioinspired spinning technology is reported that allows for continuous, high&#8208;speed production (fabrication speed up to 8400&#160;m&#160;h&#8722;1) of thin and aligned LCE microfibers combined with rapid deformation (actuation strain rate up to 810% s&#8722;1), powerful actuation (actuation stress up to 5.3&#160;MPa), high response frequency (50&#160;Hz), and long cycle life (250&#8201;000 cycles without obvious fatigue). Inspired by liquid crystalline spinning of spiders that takes advantage of multiple drawdowns to thin and align their dragline silks, internal drawdown via tapered&#8208;wall&#8208;induced&#8208;shearing and external drawdown via mechanical stretching are employed to shape LCEs into long, thin, aligned microfibers with the desirable actuation performances, which few processing technologies can achieve. This bioinspired processing technology capable of scalable production of high&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs would benefit the development of smart fabrics, intelligent wearable devices, humanoid robotics, and other areas.

         <dc:description>
Ultralong&#8208;lived X&#8208;ray trapping in CsCdCl3:Mn2+, R4+ (R = Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn) is demonstrated for flexible 3D X&#8208;ray imaging. Mn2+ site occupation manipulation and heterovalent substitution significantly improve their energy&#8208;trapping capability and thermal stability. X&#8208;ray imaging with the resolution of 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1 is further demonstrated, and convenient time&#8208;lapse 3D X&#8208;ray imaging is realized for the curved objects.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray imaging has received sustained attention for healthcare diagnostics and nondestructive inspection. To develop photonic materials with tunable photophysical properties in principle accelerates radiation detection technologies. Here the rational design and synthesis of doped halide perovskite CsCdCl3:Mn2+, R4+ (R = Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn) are reported as next generation X&#8208;ray storage phosphors, and the capability is greatly improved by trap management via Mn2+ site occupation manipulation and heterovalent substitution. Specially, CsCdCl3:Mn2+, Zr4+ displays zero&#8208;thermal&#8208;quenching (TQ) radioluminescence and anti&#8208;TQ X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated persistent luminescence even up to 448 K, further revealing the charge&#8208;carrier compensation and redeployment mechanisms. X&#8208;ray imaging with the resolution of 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1 is demonstrated, and convenient 3D X&#8208;ray imaging for the curved objects is realized in a time&#8208;lapse manner. This work demonstrates efficient modulation of energy traps to achieve high storage capacities and promote future research into flexible X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Reshaping the Endogenous Electric Field to Boost Wound Repair via Electrogenerative Dressing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noninvasive electrogenerative dressing (EGD) is designed by integrating triboelectric nanogenerators with negative&#8208;pressure wound therapy, which makes a great breakthrough in wound repair and scar prevention with clinical transformation potential. The EGD accelerates the polarization of macrophages to M2 macrophages, strengthens cell proliferation and migration, augments angiogenesis and reepithelialization, enhances orientation of collagen, and reduces scars.








Abstract
The endogenous electric field (EF) generated by transepithelial potential difference plays a decisive role in wound reepithelialization. For patients with large or chronic wounds, negative&#8208;pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is the most effective clinical method in inflammation control by continuously removing the necrotic tissues or infected substances, thus creating a proproliferative microenvironment beneficial for wound reepithelialization. However, continuous negative&#8208;pressure drainage causes electrolyte loss and weakens the endogenous EF, which in turn hinders wound reepithelialization. Here, an electrogenerative dressing (EGD) is developed by integrating triboelectric nanogenerators with NPWT. By converting the negative&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced mechanical deformation into electricity, EGD produces a stable and high&#8208;safety EF that can trigger a robust epithelial electrotactic response and drive the macrophages toward a reparative M2 phenotype in vitro. Translational medicine studies confirm that EGD completely reshapes the wound EF weakened by NPWT, and promotes wound closure by facilitating an earlier transition of inflammation/proliferation and guiding epithelial migration and proliferation to accelerate reepithelialization. Long&#8208;term EGD therapy remarkably advances tissue remodeling with mature epithelium, orderly extracellular matrix, and less scar formation. Compared with the golden standard of NPWT, EGD orchestrates all the essential wound stages in a noninvasive manner, presenting an excellent prospect in clinical wound therapy.

         <title>An Efficient High&#8208;Entropy Perovskite&#8208;Type Air Electrode for Reversible Oxygen Reduction and Water Splitting in Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy Pr0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2La0.2Ca0.2CoO3&#8722;&#948; with highly enhanced activity and structural stability is developed as an air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells, demonstrating encouraging performances in the dual modes of fuel cell and electrolysis cell.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) are emerging as ideal devices for highly efficient energy conversion (generating electricity) and storage (producing H2) at intermediate temperatures (400&#8211;700&#160;&#176;C). However, their commercialization is largely hindered by the development of highly efficient air electrodes for oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting reactions. Here, the findings in the design of a highly active and durable air electrode are reported: high&#8208;entropy Pr0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2La0.2Ca0.2CoO3&#8722;&#948; (HE&#8208;PBSLCC), which exhibits impressive activity and stability for oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting reactions, as confirmed by electrochemical characterizations and structural analysis. When used as an air electrode of R&#8208;PCEC, the HE&#8208;PBSLCC achieves encouraging performances in dual modes of fuel cells (FCs) and electrolysis cells (ECs) at 650&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating a maximum power density of 1.51 W cm&#8722;2 in FC mode, and a current density of &#8722;2.68 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3 V in EC mode. Furthermore, the cells display good operational durabilities in FC and EC modes for over 270 and 500 h, respectively, and promising cycling durability for 70 h with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies. This study offers an effective strategy for the design of active and durable air electrodes for efficient oxygen reduction and water splitting.

         <title>Enzymatically Crosslinked Collagen as a Versatile Matrix for In Vitro and In Vivo Co&#8208;Engineering of Blood and Lymphatic Vasculature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel collagen biopolymer bearing enzyme&#8208;recognizable crosslinkers is developed to rapidly produce bulk hydrogels exhibiting strong (lymph&#8208;)angiogenic properties. Orthogonal crosslinking enables further modification of the collagen backbone. Using a second enzyme, the tethering of pro&#8208;angiogenic QK&#8208;peptides, the production of multimaterial scaffolds that enable spatially restricted vascularization as well as the biofabrication of annealed &#181;&#8208;gels is demonstrated.








Abstract
Adequate vascularization is required for the successful translation of many in vitro engineered tissues. This study presents a novel collagen derivative that harbors multiple recognition peptides for orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking based on sortase A&#160;(SrtA) and Factor XIII&#160;(FXIII). SrtA&#8208;mediated crosslinking enables the rapid co&#8208;engineering of human blood and lymphatic microcapillaries and mesoscale capillaries in bulk hydrogels. Whereas tuning of gel stiffness determines the extent of neovascularization, the relative number of blood and lymphatic capillaries recapitulates the ratio of blood and lymphatic endothelial cells originally seeded into the hydrogel. Bioengineered capillaries readily form luminal structures and exhibit typical maturation markers both in vitro and in vivo. The secondary crosslinking enzyme Factor XIII is used for in situ tethering of the VEGF mimetic QK peptide to collagen. This approach supports the formation of blood and lymphatic capillaries in the absence of exogenous VEGF. Orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking is further used to bioengineer hydrogels with spatially defined polymer compositions with pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;angiogenic properties. Finally, macroporous scaffolds based on secondary crosslinking of microgels enable vascularization independent from supporting fibroblasts. Overall, this work demonstrates for the first time the co&#8208;engineering of mature micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;sized blood and lymphatic capillaries using a highly versatile collagen derivative.

         <title>Upcycling of Waste Plastic into Hybrid Carbon Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed waste plastic can be efficiently upcycled to carbon nanotubes and hybrid nanomaterials. The products&#160;have controllable morphologies, and can be synthesized in solvent&#8208; and inert gas&#8208;free methods. These nanomaterials outperform commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes in vinyl ester composites, and life&#8208;cycle assessment demonstrates 86&#8211;94% improvements in greenhouse gas emissions and energy demand, compared to current nanotube production routes.








Abstract
Graphitic 1D&#160;and hybrid nanomaterials represent a powerful solution in composite and electronic applications due to exceptional properties, but large&#8208;scale synthesis of hybrid materials has yet to be realized. Here, a rapid, scalable method to produce graphitic 1D materials from polymers using flash Joule heating (FJH) is reported. This avoids lengthy chemical vapor deposition and uses no solvent or water. The flash 1D materials (F1DM), synthesized using a variety of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, have controllable diameters and morphologies by parameter tuning. Furthermore, the process can be modified to form hybrid materials, with F1DM bonded to turbostratic graphene. In nanocomposites, F1DM outperform&#160;commercially available carbon nanotubes. Compared to current 1D material synthetic strategies using life cycle assessment, FJH synthesis represents an 86&#8211;92% decrease in cumulative energy demand and 92&#8211;94% decrease in global&#8208;warming potential. This work suggests that FJH affords a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable route to upcycle waste plastic into valuable 1D and hybrid nanomaterials.

     alt="Upcycling of Waste Plastic into Hybrid Carbon Nanomaterials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed waste plastic can be efficiently upcycled to carbon nanotubes and hybrid nanomaterials. The products&#160;have controllable morphologies, and can be synthesized in solvent- and inert gas-free methods. These nanomaterials outperform commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes in vinyl ester composites, and life-cycle assessment demonstrates 86&#8211;94% improvements in greenhouse gas emissions and energy demand, compared to current nanotube production routes.

         <title>Highly Selective Transformation of Biomass Derivatives to Valuable Chemicals by Single&#8208;Atom Photocatalyst Ni/TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct light&#8208;driven glycerol conversion to valuable chemicals under mild conditions is not only of scientific significance, but also of economic interest. A highly selective photocatalyst is prepared for the transformation of glycerol to the high&#8208;value product glycolaldehyde, which is composed of nickel single atoms confined on TiO2, presenting nearly three times higher turnover number than NiOx&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalysts.








Abstract
Selective C&#63743;C cleavage of the biomass derivative glycerol under mild conditions is recognized as a promising yet challenging synthesis route to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. Here, a highly selective catalyst for the transformation of glycerol to the high&#8208;value product glycolaldehyde is presented, which is composed of nickel single atoms confined to the surface of titanium dioxide. Driven by light, the catalyst operates under ambient conditions using air as a green oxidant. The optimized catalyst shows a selectivity of over 60% to glycolaldehyde, resulting in 1058 &#181;mol&#160;gCat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 production rate, and &#8776;3 times higher turnover number than NiOx&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalyst. Diverse operando and in situ spectroscopies unveil the unique function of the Ni single atom, which can significantly promote oxygen adsorption, work as an electron sink, and accelerate the production of superoxide radicals, thereby improving the selectivity toward glycolaldehyde over other by&#8208;products.

         <title>Enhancing Photon Utilization Efficiency for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells via Regulating Phase&#8208;Transition Kinetics</title>

A multiscale fibril network morphology is constructed using a ternary approach. An ideal morphology is beneficial for charge transfer and transport. Based on the optimized ternary system, outstanding PCEs of over 19.5% for single&#8208;junction cells and over 20% for tandem organic photovoltaic cells (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) are achieved.








Abstract
Efficient photon utilization is key to achieving high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. In this study, a multiscale fibril network morphology in a PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBDB&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based system is constructed by regulating donor and acceptor phase&#8208;transition kinetics. The distinctive phase&#8208;transition process and crystal size are systematically investigated. PBQx&#8208;TCl and eC9&#8208;2Cl form fibril structures with diameters of &#8776;25&#160;nm in ternary films. Additionally, fine fibrils assembled by PBDB&#8208;TF are uniformly distributed over the fibril networks of PBQx&#8208;TCl and eC9&#8208;2Cl. The ideal multiscale fibril network morphology enables the ternary system to achieve superior charge transfer and transport processes compared to binary systems; these improvements promote enhanced photon utilization efficiency. Finally, a high power conversion efficiency of 19.51% in a single&#8208;junction OPV cell is achieved. The external quantum efficiency of the optimized ternary cell exceeds 85% over a wide range of 500&#8211;800&#160;nm. A tandem OPV cell is also fabricated to increase solar photon absorption. The tandem cell has an excellent PCE of more than 20%. This study provides guidance for constructing an ideal multiscale fibril network morphology and improving the photon utilization efficiency of OPV cells.

         <title>Controlled Distributed Ti3C2Tx Hollow Microspheres on Thermally Conductive Polyimide Composite Films for Excellent Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible (Fe3O4/polyimide (PI))&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres show electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 85 dB owing to the magnetic loss in Fe3O4/PI fiber film, multiple reflection, ohmic loss, and polarization loss in Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres.








Abstract
Flexible multifunctional polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composite films have important applications in the fields of 5G communication technology, wearable electronic devices, and artificial intelligence. Based on the design of a porous/multilayered structure and using polyimide (PI) as the matrix and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres as the template, flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres are successfully prepared by sacrificial template method. Owing to the porous/multilayered structure, when the pore size of the Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres is 10&#160;&#181;m and the mass ratio of PMMA/Ti3C2Tx is 2:1, the (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film has the most excellent EMI shielding performance, with EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 85&#160;dB. It is further verified by finite element simulation that the composite film has an excellent shielding effect on electromagnetic waves. In addition, the composite film has good thermal conductivity (thermal conductivity coefficient of 3.49&#160;W (m&#183;K)&#8722;1) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 65.3&#160;MPa). This flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film with excellent EMI shielding performance, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties has demonstrated great potential for applications in EMI shielding protection for high&#8208;power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.

Single&#8208;Molecule Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
In article number 2209750, Zitong Liu, Xuefeng Guo, and co&#8208;workers integrate a functional electroluminescent molecular bridge into nanogapped graphene electrodes to build a high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule light&#8208;emitting diode (SM&#8208;LED) with unprecedented levels of stability and reproducibility. Precise tunability of its emission efficiency, color purity, emitted photon number, and energy is achieved upon application of external electric fields, rational molecular engineering, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, affording a new practical single&#8208;photon emitter, a milestone in developing the next generation of commercial display devices, and for quantum computation and communication.

Physical Unclonable Functions
In article number 2210621, Bowen Zhu, Hong Wang, and co&#8208;workers use printed epsilon&#8208;type&#8208;structure transistor arrays with a modified indium tin oxide coffee&#8208;ring structure to construct physical unclonable functions (PUFs) that demonstrate near&#8208;ideal uniformity, uniqueness, randomness, reliability, and low power consumption. Additionally, the PUFs are secure against attack by a powerful machine&#8208;learning model without post&#8208;processing. The epsilon&#8208;type structure provides a printable, simple strategy for high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;scale hardware secure primitives.

Therapeutic Antioxidants
In article number 2208989, Gwang&#8208;Bum Im, Young Geon Kim, Tae Yong Yoo, Taeghwan Hyeon, Suk Ho Bhang, and co&#8208;workers report the therapeutic effect of copper&#8208;deposited ceria nanoparticles (CuCe NPs) on ischemic vascular diseases. They exhibit enhanced antioxidant effects over pristine ceria nanoparticles as the released copper buffers the depletion of glutathione while providing the bioavailable copper as a cofactor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1.

Chiral Ceramic Nanoparticles
In article number 2206956, Hendrik Heinz, Nicholas A. Kotov, and co&#8208;workers describe how the chirality of V2O3 nanoparticles strongly changes when they intercalate Zn2+ ions, generating strong modulation f polarization rotation from the ultraviolet to infrared range. High g&#8208;factors, synthetic simplicity, and environmental robustness of self&#8208;assembled composite films from chiral V2O3 nanoparticles provide a versatile platform for photonic devices.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202206956"&gt;2206956&lt;/a&gt;, Hendrik Heinz, Nicholas A. Kotov, and co-workers describe how the chirality of V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles strongly changes when they intercalate Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, generating strong modulation f polarization rotation from the ultraviolet to infrared range. High &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-factors, synthetic simplicity, and environmental robustness of self-assembled composite films from chiral V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles provide a versatile platform for photonic devices.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystal Superlattice: Self&#8208;Assembly and Optical Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;halide perovskite superlattices assembled from dispersed nanocrystals feature abundant geometries and unique optical properties, becoming intriguing study objects both for fundamental research and practical applications. A review covering packing models, functional capping ligands, synthetic methodologies, characterization technologies, optical fingerprints, and contemporary applications is presented. Outstanding issues and the&#160;perspective outlook&#160;are highlighted to inspire more research in this field.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into superlattices is a fascinating process that not only changes geometric morphology, but also creates unique properties that considerably enrich the material toolbox for new applications. Numerous studies have driven the blossoming of superlattices from various aspects. These include precise control of size and morphology, enhancement of properties, exploitation of functions, and&#160;integration of the material into miniature devices. The effective synthesis of metal&#8211;halide perovskite nanocrystals has advanced research on self&#8208;assembly of building blocks into micrometer&#8208;sized superlattices. More importantly, these materials exhibit abundant optical features,&#160;including highly coherent superfluorescence, amplified spontaneous laser emission, and adjustable spectral redshift, facilitating basic research and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of metal&#8211;halide perovskite superlattices. It begins with basic packing models and introduces various stacking configurations of superlattices. The potential of multiple capping ligands is also discussed and their crucial role in superlattice growth is highlighted, followed by detailed reviews of synthesis and characterization methods. How these optical features can be distinguished and present contemporary applications is then considered. This review concludes with a list of unanswered questions and an outlook on their potential use in quantum computing and quantum communications to stimulate further research in this area.

         <title>On the Road to the Frontiers of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Review and Outlook of Graphene Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fascinating physicochemical properties endow graphene with great prospects in substituting the graphite&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This review aims to provide a research roadmap of graphene anodes by means of systematically summarizing and in&#8208;depth analyzing the related advances for high&#8208;performance LIBs. Finally, future challenges and research directions associated with the practical application of graphene anodes are outlined.








Abstract
Graphene has long been recognized as a potential anode for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The past decade has witnessed the rapid advancement of graphene anodes, and considerable breakthroughs are achieved so far. In this review, the aim is to provide a research roadmap of graphene anodes toward practical LIBs. The Li storage mechanism of graphene is started with&#160;and then the approaches to improve its electrochemical performance&#160;are comprehensively summarized. First, morphologically engineered graphene anodes with porous, spheric, ribboned, defective and holey structures display improved capacity and rate performance owing to their highly accessible surface area, interconnected diffusion channels, and sufficient active sites. Surface&#8208;modified graphene anodes with less aggregation, fast electrons/ions transportation, and optimal solid electrolyte interphase are discussed, demonstrating the close connection between the surface structure and electrochemical activity of graphene. Second, graphene derivatives anodes prepared by heteroatom doping and covalent functionalization are outlined, which show great advantages in boosting the Li storage performances because of the additionally introduced defect/active sites for further Li accommodation. Furthermore, binder&#8208;free and free&#8208;standing graphene electrodes are&#160;presented,&#160;exhibiting great prospects for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and flexible LIBs. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities of practically available graphene anodes for advanced LIBs are highlighted.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 16, April 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, corroles, benzoannulenes, crown ethers, cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, or pillararenes can be installed on covalent organic frameworks to make macrocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks for applications such as single&#8208;atom catalyst, adsorption, electronics, photodynamic therapy, and single&#8208;layer design.








Abstract
Macrocycles with well&#8208;defined cavities and the ability to undergo supramolecular interactions are classical materials that have played an essential role in materials science. However, one of the most substantial barriers limiting the utilization of macrocycles is their aggregation, which blocks the active regions. Among many attempted strategies to prevent such aggregation, installing macrocycles into covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are porous and stable reticular networks, has emerged as an ideal solution. The resulting macrocycle&#8208;based COFs (M&#8208;COFs) preserve the macrocycles&#8217; unique activities, enabling applications in various fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, adsorption/separation, optoelectronics, phototherapy, and structural design of forming single&#8208;layered or mechanically interlocked COFs. The resulting properties are unmatchable by any combination of macrocycles with other substrates, opening a new chapter in advanced materials. This review focuses on the latest progress in the concepts, synthesis, properties, and applications of M&#8208;COFs, and presents an in&#8208;depth outlook on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field.

         <title>In&#160;Liquido Computation with Electrochemical Transistors and Mixed Conductors for Intelligent Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have&#160;emerged as ideal elements for a multitude of applications in bioelectronics. However, integration of multiple OECTs is still challenging because the electrolyte &#8220;shorts&#8221; all the devices producing unwanted crosstalk. Such crosstalks are explained and modeled and strategies to avoid it, or alternatively, to harness it in order to produce intelligent bioelectronics are discussed.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation implantable computational devices require long&#8208;term&#8208;stable electronic components capable of operating in, and interacting with, electrolytic surroundings without being damaged. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) emerged as fitting candidates. However, while single devices feature impressive figures&#160;of merit, integrated circuits (ICs) immersed in common electrolytes are hard to realize using electrochemical transistors, and there is no clear path forward for optimal top&#8208;down circuit design and high&#8208;density integration. The simple observation that two OECTs immersed in the same electrolytic medium will inevitably interact hampers their implementation in complex circuitry. The electrolyte's ionic conductivity connects all the devices in the liquid, producing unwanted and often unforeseeable dynamics. Minimizing or harnessing this crosstalk has been the focus of very recent studies. Herein, the main challenges, trends, and opportunities for realizing OECT&#8208;based circuitry in a liquid environment that could circumnavigate the hard limits of engineering and human physiology, are discussed. The most successful approaches in autonomous bioelectronics and information processing are analyzed. Elaborating on the strategies to circumvent and harness device crosstalk proves that platforms capable of complex computation and even machine learning (ML) can be realized in&#160;liquido using mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs).

A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive transformable polypeptide nanoparticle is shown to initiate selective biomineralization for effective blockade therapy of osteosarcoma after activation by the acidic tumor microenvironment, which triggers continuous ion deposition to construct a mineralized barrier around the tumor and alleviates bone dissolution to suppress osteosarcoma progression, indicating significant potential for clinical osteosarcoma therapy.








Abstract
Biomineralization is a normal physiological process that includes nucleation, crystal growth, phase transformation, and orientation evolution. Notably, artificially induced biomineralization in the tumor tissue has emerged as an unconventional yet promising modality for malignancy therapy. However, the modest ion&#8208;chelating capabilities of carboxyl&#8208;containing biomineralization initiators lead to a deficient blockade, thus compromising antitumor efficacy. Herein, a biomineralization&#8208;inducing nanoparticle (BINP) is developed for blockade therapy of osteosarcoma. BINP is composed of dodecylamine&#8208;poly((&#947;&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate)&#8208;co&#8208;(l&#8208;histidine))&#8208;block&#8208;poly(l&#8208;glutamate&#8208;graft&#8208;alendronate) and combines a cytomembrane&#8208;insertion moiety, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive component, and an ion&#8208;chelating motif. After intravenous injection into osteosarcoma&#8208;bearing mice, BINP responds to the acidic TME to expose the dodecyl group on the surface of the expanded nanoparticles, facilitating their cytomembrane insertion. Subsequently, the protruding bisphosphonic acid group triggers continuous ion deposition to construct a mineralized barrier around the tumor, which blocks substance exchange between the tumor and surrounding normal tissues. The BINP&#8208;mediated blockade therapy displays tumor inhibition rates of 59.3% and 52.1% for subcutaneous and orthotopic osteosarcomas, respectively, compared with the Control group. In addition, the suppression of osteoclasts by the alendronate moiety alleviates bone dissolution and further inhibits pulmonary metastases. Hence, the BINP&#8208;initiated selective biomineralization provides a promising alternative for clinical osteosarcoma therapy.

         <title>An Ultrathin Nonporous Polymer Separator Regulates Na Transfer Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Storage Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrathin exterior&#8208;nonporous polymer separator composed of honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers is prepared for high&#8208;energy sodium storage batteries. It effectively suppresses Na dendrites and avoids the related safety risk, as&#160;well&#160;as shows the ability to customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, thereby leading to ion&#8208;conductivity&#8208;enhanced inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase and cathode electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Sodium storage batteries are one of the ever&#8208;increasing next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to the abundant resources and low cost. However, their viability is severely hampered by dendrite&#8208;related hazards on anodes. Herein, a novel ultrathin (8 &#181;m) exterior&#8208;nonporous separator composed of honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers is prepared for homogeneous Na deposition and suppressed dendrite penetration. The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits&#160;from honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion&#8208;conductivity&#8208;enhanced inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the&#160;separator, the assembled sodium&#8208;ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety,&#160;enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as&#8208;prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium&#8208;based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.

         <title>An Engineered Living Intestinal Muscle Patch Produces Macroscopic Contractions that can Mix and Break Down Artificial Intestinal Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered intestinal muscle patch is created in vitro to generate three distinct contraction modes. It shows record strength of contractility, strong enough to mix and physically triturate viscoelastic gels that mimic the mechanical properties of the intestinal digesta. Generating such muscle patches depends on both biochemical signals from the medium and environmental cues from a bioscaffold.








Abstract
The intestinal muscle layers execute various gut wall movements to achieve controlled propulsion and mixing of intestinal content. Engineering intestinal muscle layers with complex contractile function is critical for developing bioartificial intestinal tissue to treat patients with short bowel syndrome. Here, the first demonstration of a living intestinal muscle patch capable of generating three distinct motility patterns and displaying multiple digesta manipulations&#160;is reported. Assessment of contractility, cellular morphology, and transcriptome profile reveals that successful generation of the contracting muscle patch relies on both biological factors in a serum&#8208;free medium and environmental cues from an elastic electrospun gelatin scaffold. By comparing gene&#8208;expression patterns among samples, it is shown that biological factors from the medium strongly affect ion&#8208;transport activities, while the scaffold unexpectedly regulates cell&#8211;cell communication. Analysis of ligandreceptor interactome identifies scaffold&#8208;driven changes in intercellular communication, and 78% of the upregulated ligand&#8211;receptor interactions are involved in the development and function of enteric neurons. The discoveries highlight the importance of combining biomolecular and biomaterial approaches for tissue engineering. The living intestinal muscle patch represents a pivotal advancement for building functional replacement intestinal tissue. It offers a more physiological model for studying GI motility and for preclinical drug discovery.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing, Reconfigurable, Thermal&#8208;Switching, Transformative Electronics for Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printing solid&#8211;liquid biphasic liquid metal patterns on the hygroscopic hyperbranched polymer substrate demonstrates a self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable device platform with thermal&#8208;switching stiffness and adhesion. Triggered by the increased temperature, the device platform conforms and adheres to the textured skin or other 3D curvilinear surfaces can provide an integrated remote monitoring system for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, long&#8208;term health monitoring of people and structures.








Abstract
Soft, deformable electronic devices provide the means to monitor physiological information and health conditions for disease diagnostics. However, their practical utility is limited due to the lack of intrinsical thermal switching for mechanically transformative adaptability and self&#8208;healing capability against mechanical damages. Here, the design concepts, materials and physics, manufacturing approaches, and application opportunities of self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable, thermal&#8208;switching device platforms based on hyperbranched polymers and biphasic liquid metal are reported. The former provides excellent self&#8208;healing performance and unique tunable stiffness and adhesion regulated by temperature for the on&#8208;skin switch, whereas the latter results in liquid metal circuits with extreme stretchability (&gt;900%) and high conductivity (3.40&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), as well as simple recycling capability. Triggered by the increased temperature from the skin surface, a multifunctional device platform can conveniently conform and strongly adhere to the hierarchically textured skin surface for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, comfortable health monitoring. Additionally, the self&#8208;healing and adhesive characteristics allow multiple multifunctional circuit components to assemble and completely wrap on 3D curvilinear surfaces. Together, the design, manufacturing, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;healing, transformative, and self&#8208;assembled electronics open up new opportunities for robust soft deformable devices, smart robotics, prosthetics, and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, and human&#8211;machine interfaces on irregular surfaces.

         <title>Pt&#8208;Quantum&#8208;Dot&#8208;Modified Sulfur&#8208;Doped NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Alkaline Water Splitting at Industrial Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain exceptional performance for industrial water splitting at high current densities, Pt&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;modified NiFe layered double hydroxides are designed. Benefiting from optimized mass transfer and enhanced hydrogen release, its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C in hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Suitable electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting can veritably promote practical hydrogen applications. Rational surface design is exceptionally significant for electrocatalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial expectation in water splitting. Here, Pt&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;modified sulfur&#8208;doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs) are designed with eximious catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under industrial&#160;condition. Benefiting from enhanced binding energy, mass transfer, and hydrogen release, Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs exhibit outstanding activity in HER at high current densities.

&lt;p&gt;To obtain exceptional performance for industrial water splitting at high current densities, Pt-quantum-dot-modified NiFe layered double hydroxides are designed. Benefiting from optimized mass transfer and enhanced hydrogen release, its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C in hydrogen evolution reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suitable electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting can veritably promote practical hydrogen applications. Rational surface design is exceptionally significant for electrocatalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial expectation in water splitting. Here, Pt-quantum-dot-modified sulfur-doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs) are designed with eximious catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under industrial&#160;condition. Benefiting from enhanced binding energy, mass transfer, and hydrogen release, Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs exhibit outstanding activity in HER at high current densities. Notably, it obtains an impressively low overpotential of 71&#160;mV and long-term stability of 200 h at 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, exceeding commercial 40% Pt/C and most reported Pt-based electrocatalysts. Its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C with an overpotential of 100 mV. Furthermore, at industrial temperature (65&#160;&#176;C), the electrolyzer based on Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDH needs just 1.62 V to reach the current density of 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to that of the commercial one of 40% Pt/C//IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work provides rational ideas to develop electrocatalysts with exceptional performance for industrial high-temperature water splitting at high current densities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasmonic Dual&#8208;Gap Nanodumbbells for Label&#8208;Free On&#8208;Particle Raman DNA Assays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbell (AuDGN) structures are designed, synthesized, and analyzed wherein uniform and controllable dual gaps [inter&#8208;head (between dumbbell heads) and intra&#8208;head gaps (inside dumbbell heads)] with strong and tunable electromagnetic field exist. Target DNA can directly diffuse into these externally exposed nanogaps of AuDGNs for label&#8208;free molecular fingerprint surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing of varying DNA sequences.








Abstract
Metal nanostructures with a tunable plasmonic gap are useful for photonics, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, biosensing, and bioimaging applications. The use of these structures as chemical and biological sensing/imaging probes typically requires an ultra&#8208;precise synthesis of the targeted nanostructure in a high yield,&#160;with Raman dye&#8208;labeling and complex assay components and procedures. Here, a plasmonic nanostructure with tunable dual nanogaps, Au dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbells (AuDGNs), is designed and synthesized&#160;via the anisotropic adsorption of polyethyleneimine on Au nanorods to facilitate tip&#8208;selective Au growths on nanorod tips for forming mushroom&#8208;shaped dumbbell&#8208;head structures at both tips and results in dual gaps (intra&#8208;head and inter&#8208;head gaps) within a single particle. AuDGNs are synthesized in a high yield (&gt;90%) while controlling the inter&#8208;head gap size, and the average surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factor (EF) value is 7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;108 with a very narrow EF distribution from 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;108 to 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;109 for &gt;90% of analyzed particles. Importantly, AuDGNs enable label&#8208;free on&#8208;particle SERS detection assays through the diffusion of target molecules into the intraparticle gap for different DNA sequences with varying ATGC combinations in a highly specific and sensitive manner without a need for Raman dyes.

Halogenated propeller&#8208;shaped ammonium is synthesized and applied to reduce the surface energy and prompt the formation of the &#945;&#8208;phase CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskite structure, which generates a record efficiency of 23.6% for CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3&#8208;based inverted structural perovskite solar cells with excellent stability.








Abstract
Methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 is rising as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. However, the growth of high&#8208;quality CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 black&#8208;phase perovskite structure without ion doping in the lattice remains a challenge. Herein, propeller&#8208;shaped halogenated tertiary ammonium is synthesized, showing high binding energy on the perovskite surface and large steric hindrance. This molecule can significantly reduce the barrier of high surface energy that suppresses the growth of the &#945;&#8208;phase CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 structure. As a result, the &#945;&#8208;phase structure can be formed at room temperature, which can further act as a seed for the growth of high&#8208;quality film. Solar cells based on the film show a record efficiency up to 23.6% for MA free CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 solar cells with inverted structure and excellent stability at 85&#160;&#176;C over 200&#160;h.

         <title>Dynamically Interfacial pH&#8208;Buffering Effect Enabled by N&#8208;Methylimidazole Molecules as Spontaneous Proton Pumps toward Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) which acts as a spontaneous proton pump, is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time. An in situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultra&#8208;microelectrode technology is developed to probe pH evolution in the diffusion layer.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding merits of high safety and low cost. However, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of zinc in aqueous electrolyte inevitably results in hydrogen evolution, and the consequent generation of OH&#8722; at the interface will dramatically exacerbate the formation of dead zinc and dendrites. Herein, a dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) additive is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time, thus eliminating the accumulation of by&#8208;products fundamentally. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and molecular dynamics simulation results reveal the existence of an interfacial absorption layer assembled by NMI and protonated NMI (NMIH+), which acts as an ion pump for replenishing the interface with protons constantly. Moreover, an in situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultra&#8208;microelectrode technology is developed to probe the pH evolution in diffusion layer, confirming the stabilized interfacial chemical environment in NMI&#8208;containing electrolyte. Accordingly, with the existence of NMI, an excellent cumulative plating capacity of 4.2 Ah cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.74% are realized for zinc electrodes. Meanwhile, the NMI/NMIH+ buffer additive can accelerate the dissolution/deposition process of MnO2/Mn2+ on the cathode, leading to enhanced cycling capacity.

         <dc:description>
The interface control of electronic structure in single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer ruthenates is demonstrated. Combining thin film epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy, a method to study interfacial electronic phases of ultrathin heterostructures is developed. Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases of SrRuO3 are discovered, exclusively in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. This work suggests a general way to investigate ultrathin interfacial electronic systems.








Abstract
Interfaces between dissimilar correlated oxides can offer devices with versatile functionalities, and great efforts have been made to manipulate interfacial electronic phases. However, realizing such phases is often hampered by the inability to directly access the electronic structure information; most correlated interfacial phenomena appear within a few atomic layers from the interface. Here, atomic&#8208;scale epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy are utilized to realize the interface control of correlated electronic phases in atomic&#8208;scale ruthenate&#8211;titanate heterostructures. While bulk SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic metal, the heterointerfaces exclusively generate three distinct correlated phases in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. The theoretical analysis reveals that atomic&#8208;scale structural proximity effects yield Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases in the quantum&#8208;confined SrRuO3. These results highlight the extensive interfacial tunability of electronic phases, hitherto hidden in the atomically thin correlated heterostructure. Moreover, this experimental platform suggests a way to control interfacial electronic phases of various correlated materials.

         <title>A Polymorphic Memtransistor with Tunable Metallic and Semiconducting Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymorphic memtransistor based on atomically thin Mo0.91W0.09Te2 is achieved, where the lateral device channel can be tuned as metallic and semiconducting for diverse neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing.








Abstract
Modulating semiconducting channel potential has been used for electrical switching in transistors without biological plasticity operations that are critical for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To achieve efficient data processing, alternative transport mechanisms, such as tunneling and thermionic emission, have been introduced with 2D materials. Here, a polymorphic memtransistor based on atomically thin Mo0.91W0.09Te2 is presented, where the lattice and electronic structures of the lateral device channel can be tuned as either metallic (1T&#8242;) or semiconducting (2H) phases by electrical gating. The structural and electronic phase change of the channel material, optimized in Mo0.91W0.09Te2, is explored using transport and optical measurements at the device scale. Based on the phase transition, the polymorphic memtransistor demonstrates a high on/off ratio (up to 105), low subthreshold swing (down to 80&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), and various memristive behaviors, which are distinguished from traditional phase&#8208;change memory, transistors, and passive memristors for diverse neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>Encapsulating High&#8208;Temperature Superconducting Twisted van der Waals Heterostructures Blocks Detrimental Effects of Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method of fabricating high&#8208;temperature&#8208;superconductor&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures is reported. The novel method utilizing the encapsulating heterostructure's interface overcomes detrimental effects of disorder and enables crucial improvement of the characteristics of the Josephson junction constituting the core of the proposed van der Waals material. The designed heterostructures operating at elevated temperatures holds potential for emerging quantum technologies.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature cuprate superconductors based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold high technological promise. One of the obstacles hindering their progress is the detrimental effect of disorder on the properties of the vdW&#8208;devices&#8208;based Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, a new method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8+&#948;, crucially improving the JJ characteristics and pushing them up to those of the intrinsic JJs in bulk samples, is reported. The method combines cryogenic stacking using a solvent&#8208;free stencil mask technique and covering the interface by insulating hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high&#8208;vacuum condition down to 10&#8722;6 mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected from water molecules during the in situ metal deposition only when fully encapsulated. Comparing the current&#8211;voltage curves of encapsulated and unencapsulated interfaces, it is revealed that the encapsulated interfaces&#8217; characteristics are crucially improved, so that the corresponding JJs demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, it is shown that the encapsulated heterostructures are more stable over&#160;time.

         <title>An Active Pixel&#8208;Matrix Electrocaloric Device for Targeted and Differential Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient pixel&#8208;matrix electrocaloric (EC) cooling device is demonstrated on which each refrigeration pixel can be independently controlled and can effectively cool down the localized overheating on microelectronics in situ as needed. All active pixels in the EC cooling device exhibit a stable temperature span of 4.6 K and a heat flux of 62&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8208;1.








Abstract
More than 55% of electronic failures are caused by damage from localized overheating. Up to now, there is still no efficient method for targeted temperature control against localized overheating. Although some existing thermal management devices handle this issue by full coverage cooling, it generates a lot of useless energy consumption. Here, a highly efficient pixel&#8208;matrix electrocaloric (EC) cooling device is reported, which can realize a targeted and differential thermal management. The modified poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;tertrifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) reaches a large adiabatic temperature change of 7.8 K and is more suitable for thermal transfer and electrostatic actuation at high frequencies. All active pixels in the EC cooling device exhibit a stable temperature span of 4.6 K and a heat flux of 62&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8208;2, which is more than twice that of the one&#8208;layer EC device. Each refrigeration pixel can be independently controlled and effectively cooled down the localized overheating site(s) in situ. The surface temperature of the simulated central processing unit decreases by 33.2 K at 120 s after applying this EC device. Such a compact, embeddable, low cost, and active solid&#8208;state pixel&#8208;matrix cooling device has great potential for localized overheating protection in microelectronics.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Architected Ceramics via Microwave&#8208;Activated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;activated, embedded 3D printing (EMB3D) method is developed to create complex ceramic lattices and interpenetrating architectures with tailored composition, density, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Light&#8208; and ink&#8208;based 3D printing methods have vastly expanded the design space and geometric complexity of architected ceramics. However, light&#8208;based methods are typically confined to a relatively narrow range of preceramic and particle&#8208;laden resins, while ink&#8208;based methods are limited in geometric complexity due to layerwise assembly. Here, embedded 3D printing is combined with microwave&#8208;activated curing to generate architected ceramics with spatially controlled composition in freeform shapes. Aqueous colloidal inks are printed within a support matrix, rapidly cured via microwave&#8208;activated polymerization, and subsequently dried and sintered into dense architectures composed of one or more oxide materials. This&#160;integrated manufacturing method opens new avenues for the design and fabrication of complex ceramic architectures with programmed composition, density, and form for myriad applications.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of &#63743;P&#63742;N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Single&#8208;Atom Catalytic Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) as the carbon source, &#63743;P&#63742;N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers can be synthesized by NMP&#8211;P2O5 interaction, serving as a superior support to build the single&#8208;atom catalyst for hydrosilylation. Since NMP itself is an outstanding solvent, it is possible to regulate the structure of the carbon nanofibers by dissolving other chemicals/materials.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a popular choice in various catalysis applications, as they take advantages of both homogeneous catalysis (e.g., high efficiency) and heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., easy catalyst recovery). The atom support plays an indispensable role in anchoring atomic species and interplaying with them for ultimate catalytic performance. Therefore, development of new support materials for superior catalysis is of great importance. Here the synthesis of carbon nanofibers based on the reaction between phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) is reported. The underlying reaction process is systematically investigated by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared&#160;(FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The carbon nanofibers have interesting &#63743;P&#63742;N&#63743; units in their chemical structure, which act as anchoring sites for the single&#8208;atom catalyst. The Pt atoms anchoring carbon nanofibers exhibit high activity for hydrosilylation with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of &gt;99%. This research affords not only a new in situ chemical strategy to synthesize multiatom doped carbon nanofibers but also presents a potential superior support in catalysis, which opens a hopeful window in materials chemistry and catalysis applications.

         <title>Extremely Robust and Multifunctional Nanocomposite Fibers for Strain&#8208;Unperturbed Textile Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely robust and multifunctional nanocomposite fiber is fabricated by introducing a mechanically interlocked network inside the fibrous structure. The fiber obtains strong resistance against structural crack formation and propagation, and the fiber&#8208;based textile electronics show exceptional robustness. The textile&#8208;based electromechanical sensors exhibited strain&#8208;unalterable sensing performance and fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors showed invariant electrochemical performance during large and cyclic strain perturbations.








Abstract
Textile electronics are needed that can achieve strain&#8208;unaltered performance when they undergo irregular and repeated strain deformation. Such strain&#8208;unaltered textile electronics require advanced fibers that simultaneously have high functionalities and extreme robustness as fabric materials. Current synthetic nanocomposite fibers based on inorganic matrix have remarkable functionalities but often suffer from low robustness and poor tolerance against crack formation. Here,&#160;we&#160;present a design for a high&#8208;performance multifunctional nanocomposite fiber that is mechanically and electrically robust, which&#160;was&#160;realized by crosslinking titanium carbide (MXene) nanosheets with a slide&#8208;ring polyrotaxane to form an internal mechanically&#8208;interlocked network. This inorganic matrix nanocomposite fiber featured distinct strain&#8208;hardening mechanical behavior and exceptional load&#8208;bearing capability (toughness approaching 60 MJ m&#8722;3 and ductility over 27%). It retained 100% of its ductility after cyclic strain loading. Moreover, the high electrical conductivity (&gt;1.1 &#215; 105 S m&#8722;1) and electrochemical performance (&gt;360 F cm&#8722;3) of the nanocomposite fiber can be well retained after subjecting the fiber to extensive (&gt;25% strain) and long&#8208;term repeated (10&#8201;000 cycles) dimensional changes. Such superior robustness allowed for the fabrication of the nanocomposite fibers into various robust wearable devices, such as textile&#8208;based electromechanical sensors with strain&#8208;unalterable sensing performance and fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors with invariant electrochemical performance for 10&#8201;000 strain loading cycles.

         <title>Unsaturated, Trialkyl Ionizable Lipids are Versatile Lipid&#8208;Nanoparticle Components for Therapeutic and Vaccine Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational design and structure&#8211;activity relationship analysis, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids that use trialkyl structural motifs is screened. A potent trialkyl lipid (&#8220;Lipid 10&#8221;) that demonstrates broad spectrum activity in both therapeutic and vaccine applications is identified. In many cases, it outperforms the leading ionizable lipid benchmarks used in Onpattro, SpikeVax, and Comirnaty.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven a successful platform for the delivery of nucleic acid (NA)&#8208;based therapeutics and vaccines, with the ionizable lipid component playing a key role in modulating potency and tolerability. Here, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids is screened hypothesizing that short, branched trialkyl hydrophobic domains can improve LNP fusogenicity or endosomal escape, and potency. LNPs formulated with the top&#8208;performing trialkyl lipid (Lipid 10) encapsulating transthyretin siRNA elicit significantly greater gene silencing and are better tolerated than those with the benchmark Onpattro lipid DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA. Lipid 10 also demonstrates superior liver delivery of mRNA when compared to other literature ionizable lipids, is well tolerated, and successfully repeat&#8208;doses in nonhuman primates. In a prime&#8208;boost hemagglutinin rodent vaccine model, intramuscular administration of Lipid&#8208;10 LNP elicits comparable or better antibody titers to the SM&#8208;102 and ALC&#8208;0315 lipid compositions used in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mRNA COVID vaccines. These data suggest that Lipid 10 is a particularly versatile ionizable lipid, well&#8208;suited for both systemic therapeutic and intramuscular vaccine applications and able to successfully deliver diverse NA payloads.

         <title>A Facile and Rational Method to Tailor the Symmetry of Au@Ag Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and rational method to tailor the symmetry of Au@Ag nanoparticles is reported. By introducing l&#8208;cysteine into the growth system, truncated cuboids/octahedra, well&#8208;defined octahedra, and tetrahedra can be readily obtained with the increase of Ag precursor concentration. Among them, the truncated cuboids/octahedra are chiral, and their formation can be seen as a result of dissymmetric synthesis.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the morphologies of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) is of great importance for many applications. Here, a facile seed&#8208;mediated growth method is demonstrated that tailors the morphologies of Au@Ag NPs from cubes/cuboids to chiral truncated cuboids/octahedra, well&#8208;defined octahedra, and tetrahedra, via simply increasing the concentrations of AgNO3&#160;and cysteine in the halide surfactant systems. Accordingly, the particle symmetries are also tuned. The method is quite robust where seeds with distinct shapes including irregular ones can all lead to uniform Au@Ag NPs. The evolution of these shapes can be illustrated by a recently proposed symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT). Furthermore, SBKT shows a strategy to optimize the preparation of chiral/dissymmetric NPs, and the experimental results confirm such a dissymmetric synthesis strategy. Cuboids and octahedra with corners differently truncated are identified as two different chiral forms. The chirality of the NPs is additionally probed by electrochemistry, where the chiral NPs show enantioselectivity in the oxidation of d&#8208; and l&#8208;glucose. Altogether, the results gain fundamental insights into tailoring the plasmonic NP morphologies, and also suggest strategies to obtain chiral NPs.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Emissive Radical Cations in the Stomach for Gastrointestinal Imaging</title>

Red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#160;(NIR) fluorescent probes are promising for gastrointestinal disease studies with the advantages of deep penetration and high sensitivity. However, conventional fluorophores feature electron closed&#8208;shell structures and require tedious procedures for preparation. Herein, it is found that red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive and stable pyrrole radical cations can be quickly generated in situ in an acidic stomach after gavage with simple pyrroles, which can be used for gastrointestinal imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and anti&#8208;gastric&#8208;acid therapy assessment with excellent sensitivity.








Abstract
Red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes, with advantages such as high spatiotemporal resolution and in situ sensing abilities,&#160;are highly attractive for diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases and targeted drug development. However, conventional red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with electron closed&#8208;shell structures require tedious synthetic procedures for preparation, and it is difficult to further decorate them with sensing groups. In this study, a series of easily prepared pyrroles with simple structures that can quickly be transformed into red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive radical cations in acidic buffer solution and in vivo stomachs is developed. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive pyrrole radical cations in the stomach have excellent biocompatibility and stability and can be used not only for intravital gastrointestinal imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution, but also for dynamic monitoring of the gastric emptying process and assessment of anti&#8208;gastric&#8208;acid therapy. The acidity&#8208;induced generation of pyrrole radical cations is believed to provide a facile strategy for developing red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores and studying gastrointestinal diseases.

         <title>Mass Production of Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with highly active M&#63743;N4&#63743;S sites is successfully fabricated in a sustainable and large&#8208;scale manner by utilizing a by&#8208;product of the papermaking industry (i.e., lignosulfonate) as a multifunctional bioligand. The resulting SAC exhibits enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reactions catalytic performance and shows high durability in Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs); however, scalable production of SACs from sustainable resources is difficult owing to poor control of the local coordination environment. Herein, lignosulfonate, a by&#8208;product of the papermaking industry, is utilized as a multifunctional bioligand for the mass production of SACs with highly active M&#63743;N4&#63743;S sites (M represents Fe, Cu, and Co) via strong metal&#63743;nitrogen/sulfur coordination. This effectively adjusts the charge distribution and promotes the catalytic performance, leading to highly durable and excellent performance in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for ZABs. This study paves the way for the industrial production of cost&#8208;effective SACs in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Glycerol Conversion over a Mie Scattering Effect Enhanced Porous BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mie scattering porous BiVO4 photoanode transformed from the well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode by a facile annealing treatment in the air decreases the reflection of incident light and enables the reabsorbed ability of scattered light, leading to pronounced light&#8208;harvesting efficiency enhancement, which delivers a high dihydroxyacetone conversion rate of 325.2 mmol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from photo&#8208;electrochemical glycerol oxidation.








Abstract
The photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) oxidation of glycerol (GLY) to high&#8208;value&#8208;added dihydroxyacetone (DHA) can be achieved over a BiVO4 photoanode, while the PEC performance of most BiVO4 photoanodes is impeded due to the upper limits of the photocurrent density. Here, an enhanced Mie scattering effect of the well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode is obtained with less effort by a simple annealing process, which significantly reduces the reflectivity to near zero. The great light absorbability increases the basic photocurrent density by 1.77 times. The selective oxidation of GLY over the BiVO4 photoanode results in a photocurrent density of 6.04 mA cm&#8722;2 and a DHA production rate of 325.2 mmol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 that exceeds all reported values. This work addresses the poor ability of nanostructured BiVO4 to harvest light, paving the way for further improvements in charge transport and transfer to realize highly efficient PEC conversion.

         <title>Dramatically Accelerated Formation of Graphite Intercalation Compounds Catalyzed by Sodium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pellets of graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are synthesized by the Na&#8208;catalyzed method. AM&#8211;GICs (AM&#160;= Li, Na, K) are formed simply by mixing AM and graphite with Na at room temperature. A&#160;Ca&#8208;GIC&#160;(CaC6) is formed&#160;by heating a mixture of Ca, graphite, and Na at 250 &#176;C for only several hours.








Abstract
Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have a variety of functions due to their rich material variations, and thus, innovative methods for their synthesis are desired for practical applications. It is discovered that Na has a catalytic property that dramatically accelerates the formation of GICs. It is demonstrated that LiC6n (n&#160;= 1, 2), KC8, KC12n (n&#160;= 2, 3, 4), and NaCx are synthesized simply by mixing alkali metals and graphite powder with Na at room temperature (&#8776;25&#160;&#176;C), and AEC6 (AE&#160;= Ca, Sr, Ba) are synthesized by heating Na&#8208;added reagents at 250&#160;&#176;C only for a few hours. The NaCx, formed by the mixing of C and Na, is understood to act as a reaction intermediate for a catalyst, thereby accelerating the formation of GICs by lowering the activation energy of intercalation. The Na&#8208;catalyzed method, which enables the rapid and mass synthesis of homogeneous GIC samples in a significantly simpler manner than conventional methods, is anticipated to stimulate research and development for GIC applications.

         <title>Nonlocal Cable&#8208;Network Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; reconfigurable metamaterial platform based on standard coaxial cables and bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors is proposed. Particularly, interesting nonlocal effects can be straightforwardly implemented through coupling unit cells via coaxial cables to their beyond nearest neighbors. Metamaterials with nonlocal interactions from 2nd order to 6th order are assembled and highly unusual dispersion relations than with only local interactions are experimentally demonstrated.








Abstract
Metamaterials are artificial materials in which the atoms of ordinary solids are replaced by tailored functional building blocks.

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; reconfigurable metamaterial platform based on standard coaxial cables and bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors is proposed. Particularly, interesting nonlocal effects can be straightforwardly implemented through coupling unit cells via coaxial cables to their beyond nearest neighbors. Metamaterials with nonlocal interactions from 2nd order to 6th order are assembled and highly unusual dispersion relations than with only local interactions are experimentally demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metamaterials are artificial materials in which the atoms of ordinary solids are replaced by tailored functional building blocks. Therefore, previous work has emphasized tailoring the inside of the building blocks, for example, by exploiting local resonances, to realize unusual effective metamaterial properties. However, the wave properties of a metamaterial are not only determined by its building blocks but also by the interactions between these building blocks. Here, reconfigurable &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; electromagnetic metamaterials are introduced for which the building blocks are essentially trivial standard bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors and the effective metamaterial properties are solely achieved by tailoring the local and especially the nonlocal interactions mediated by standard coaxial cables. Unprecedented dispersion relations of the lowest band with multiple regions of slow waves and backward waves are demonstrated.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Transient Self&#8208;Organization of TiNx Nano&#8208;Filament Percolated Networks for High Performance Surface&#8208;Mountable Filter Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparing low&#8208;dimensional conductive nitride&#8208;based hierarchical structures with sub&#8208;10 nm geometric characteristics has been a major challenge. A unique laser&#8208;induced transient self&#8208;organization strategy to rapidly and controllably fabricate ultrafine (diameter: 3&#8211;5 nm) TiNx nano&#8208;filament percolated chaotic fractal networks is presented. The prepared surface&#8208;mountable filter capacitors achieve a record&#8208;breaking volumetric energy density of 9.17 mWh cm&#8722;3 at 120 Hz in an aqueous electrolyte.








Abstract
Filter capacitors (FCs) are substantial for digital circuits and microelectronic devices, and thus more compact FCs are eternally demanded for system miniaturization. Even though microsupercapacitors are broadly regarded as an excellent candidate for future FCs, yet due to the limitation of available electrode materials, the capacitive performance of reported MSCs drops sharply under high&#8208;frequency alternating current. Herein, we&#160;present a unique laser&#8208;induced transient self&#8208;organization strategy, which synergizes pulsed laser energy and multi&#8208;physical field controlled coalescence processes, leading to the rapid and controllable preparation of titanium nitride ultrafine nano&#8208;filaments (diameter &#8776;3&#8211;5 nm) networks. Their chaotic fractal nanoporous structure, superior specific surface area, and excellent conductivity render these nanostructures promising candidates for FCs. Surface&#8208;mounted filter capacitors based on this electrode material exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycle&#8208;life (2 000 000 cycles) with record ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 9.17 mWh cm&#8722;3 at 120 Hz in aqueous electrolyte, displaying advantages in function, size, and integrability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aluminum electrolytic capacitors. The method here provides a versatile toolbox for designing novel nanostructures with intriguing characteristics and insights for developing advanced and miniaturized filter and power devices.

A multifunctional therapeutic immune&#8208;nanomedicine, MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA, effectively delivers cytosine&#8211;phosphate&#8211;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5,6&#8208;dimethylxanthenone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid (DMXAA) to improve the miserable immune response by reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells&#160;(DCs) maturation and inhibiting angiogenesis, achieving synergistically immunotherapy. MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA significantly enhances stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation, reverses the immunosuppression state and stimulates robust tumoricidal immunity, exhibiting a synergistic efficiency to eradicate hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has achieved revolutionary success in clinics, but it remains challenging for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characterized by high vascularization. Here, it is reported that metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;801 (MOF&#8208;801) can be employed as a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) through Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) not just as a drug delivery carrier. Notably, cytosine&#8211;phosphate&#8211;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5, 6&#8208;dimethylxanthenone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid (DMXAA) STING agonist with vascular disrupting function coordinates with MOF&#8208;801 to self&#8208;assemble into a nanoparticle (MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA) that effectively delivers CpG ODNs and DMXAA to cells for synergistically improving the tumor microenvironment by reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, as well as destroying tumor blood vessels. In HCC&#8208;bearing mouse models, it is demonstrated that MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA triggers systemic immune activation and stimulates robust tumoricidal immunity, resulting in a superior immunotherapeutic efficiency in orthotopic and recurrent HCC.

         <title>Superfast Mass Transport of Na/K Via Mesochannels for Dendrite&#8208;Free Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na/K plating&#8211;stripping behaviors in carbon hosts with mesochannels that enable superfast mass transport are systematically studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy. These mesochannels can remarkably increase the accessible surface area, thus boosting the surface ion diffusion, and then becoming the superfast channels for Na/K transport via interfacial diffusion. Such pore&#8208;modified hosts enable dendrite&#8208;free sodium deposition and superior high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Fast ion diffusion in anode hosts enabling uniform distribution of Li/Na/K is essential for achieving dendrite&#8208;free alkali&#8208;metal batteries. Common strategies, e.g. expanding the interlayer spacing of anode materials, can enhance bulk diffusion of Li but are less efficient for Na and K due to their larger ionic radius. Herein, a universal strategy to drastically improve the mass&#8208;transport efficiency of Na/K by introducing open mesochannels in carbon hosts is proposed. Such pore engineering can increase the accessible surface area by one order of magnitude, thus remarkably accelerating surface diffusion, as visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy. In particular, once the mesochannels are filled by the&#160;Na/K metals, they become the superfast channels for mass transport via the mechanism of interfacial diffusion. Thus&#8208;modified carbon hosts enable Na/K filling in their inner cavities and uniform deposition across the whole electrodes with fast kinetics. The resulting Na&#8208;metal anodes can exhibit stable dendrite&#8208;free cycling with outstanding rate performance at a high current density of up to 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work presents an inspiring attempt to address the sluggish transport issue of Na/K, as well as valuable insights into the mass&#8208;transport mechanism in porous anodes for high&#8208;performance alkali&#8208;metal storage.

         <title>Nanoimprinted 2D&#8208;Chiral Perovskite Nanocrystal Metasurfaces for Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unmodified CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr1I2 perovskite nanocrystals exhibit intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) reaching glum values up to 0.15 and 0.3 (with a high index coating) when they are nanostructured into 2D chiral metasurfaces using soft nanoimprinting lithography. The approach is scalable and leads to large areas enabling CPL production from a variety of nanoemitters.








Abstract
The versatile hybrid perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the most promising materials for optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields. However, their inherent crystalline chemical structure limits the chiroptical properties achievable with the material. The production of chiral perovskites has become an active field of research for its promising applications in optics, chemistry, or biology. Typically, chiral halide perovskites are obtained by the incorporation of different chiral moieties in the material. Unfortunately, these chemically modified perovskites have demonstrated moderate values of chiral PL so far. Here, a general and scalable approach is introduced to produce chiral PL from arbitrary nanoemitters assembled into 2D&#8208;chiral metasurfaces. The fabrication via nanoimprinting lithography employs elastomeric molds engraved with chiral motifs covering millimeter areas that are used to pattern two types of unmodified colloidal perovskite NC inks: green&#8208;emissive CsPbBr3 and red&#8208;emissive CsPbBr1I2. The perovskite 2D&#8208;metasurfaces exhibit remarkable PL dissymmetry factors (glum) of 0.16 that can be further improved up to glum of 0.3 by adding a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index coating on the metasurfaces. This scalable approach to produce chiral photoluminescent thin films paves the way for the seamless production of bright chiral light sources for upcoming optoelectronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The versatile hybrid perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the most promising materials for optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields. However, their inherent crystalline chemical structure limits the chiroptical properties achievable with the material. The production of chiral perovskites has become an active field of research for its promising applications in optics, chemistry, or biology. Typically, chiral halide perovskites are obtained by the incorporation of different chiral moieties in the material. Unfortunately, these chemically modified perovskites have demonstrated moderate values of chiral PL so far. Here, a general and scalable approach is introduced to produce chiral PL from arbitrary nanoemitters assembled into 2D-chiral metasurfaces. The fabrication via nanoimprinting lithography employs elastomeric molds engraved with chiral motifs covering millimeter areas that are used to pattern two types of unmodified colloidal perovskite NC inks: green-emissive CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and red-emissive CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The perovskite 2D-metasurfaces exhibit remarkable PL dissymmetry factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.16 that can be further improved up to &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.3 by adding a high-refractive-index coating on the metasurfaces. This scalable approach to produce chiral photoluminescent thin films paves the way for the seamless production of bright chiral light sources for upcoming optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synaptic Resistor Circuits Based on Al Oxide and Ti Silicide for Concurrent Learning and Signal Processing in Artificial Intelligence Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic resistor (synstor) circuit concurrently executes signal processing and learning in real time to fly drones toward a target in an aerodynamically changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the environment significantly superior to an artificial neural network on computers, providing a path to establish power&#8208;efficient intelligent systems in the capriciously mutable real world.








Abstract
Neurobiological circuits containing synapses can process signals while learning concurrently in real time. Before an artificial neural network (ANN) can execute a signal&#8208;processing program, it must first be programmed by humans or trained with respect to a large and defined data set during learning processes, resulting in significant latency, high power consumption, and poor adaptability to unpredictable changing environments. In&#160;this&#160;work, a crossbar circuit of synaptic resistors (synstors) is reported, each synstor integrating a Si channel with an Al oxide memory layer and Ti silicide Schottky contacts. Individual synstors are characterized and analyzed to understand their concurrent signal&#8208;processing and learning abilities. Without any prior training, synstor circuits concurrently execute signal processing and learning in real time to fly drones toward a target position in an aerodynamically changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the environment significantly superior to an ANN running on computers. The synstor circuit provides a path to establish power&#8208;efficient intelligent systems with real&#8208;time learning and adaptability in the capriciously mutable real world.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Assisted Wet Annealing: A New Strategy for Superstrong, Tough, Stretchable, and Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;annealing strategy is first proposed to develop superstrong and tough hydrogels with extremely high stretchability and excellent fatigue resistance. The hydrogels have extremely high tensile strength of 11.19 &#177; 0.27 MPa, a fracture toughness of 82.28 &#177; 2.89 MJ m&#8722;3 with stretchability up to 1879 &#177; 10%, and a fatigue threshold of &#8776;1233 J m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Hydrogels are widely used in tissue engineering, soft robots, wearable electronics, etc. However, it remains a great challenge to develop hydrogels possessing simultaneously high strength, large stretchability, great fracture energy, and good fatigue threshold to suit different applications. Herein, a novel solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;annealing strategy is proposed to prepare high performance poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels by extensively tuning the macromolecular chain movement and optimizing the polymer network. The reinforcing and toughening mechanisms are found to be &#8220;macromolecule crystallization and entanglement&#8221;. These hydrogels have large tensile strengths up to 11.19 &#177; 0.27&#160;MPa and extremely high fracture strains of 1879 &#177; 10%. In addition, the fracture energy and fatigue threshold can reach as high as 25.39 &#177; 6.64&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 and &#8776;1233 J m&#8722;2, respectively. These superb mechanical properties compare favorably to those of other tough hydrogels, organogels, and even natural tendons and synthetic rubbers. This work provides a new and effective method to fabricate superstrong, tough, stretchable, and anti&#8208;fatigue hydrogels with potential applications in artificial tendons and ligaments.

         <title>Electronic State and Microenvironment Modulation of Metal Nanoparticles Stabilized by MOFs for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>

Tiny PdCu nanoparticles are encapsulated into a representative metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;SO3H, followed by post&#8208;synthetic coating of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer to afford PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS composite. Strikingly, the protonated and hydrophobic microenvironment&#160;and electron&#8208;rich PdCu sites endow PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS with high activity toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (Faraday efficiency: 13.16%, yield: 20.24&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), far superior to the corresponding counterparts.








Abstract
Modulation of the local electronic structure and microenvironment of catalytic metal sites plays a critical role in electrocatalysis, yet remains a grand challenge. Herein, PdCu nanoparticles with an electron rich state are encapsulated into a sulfonate functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;SO3H (simply as UiO&#8208;S), and their microenvironment&#160;is further modulated by coating a hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer, affording PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS. This resultant catalyst presents high activity toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR, Faraday efficiency: 13.16%, yield: 20.24&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), far superior to the corresponding counterparts. Experimental and theoretical results jointly demonstrate that the protonated and hydrophobic microenvironment supplies protons for the NRR yet suppresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction reaction, and electron&#8208;rich PdCu sites in PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS are favorable to formation of the N2H* intermediate and reduce the energy barrier of NRR, thereby accounting for its good performance.

         <title>Planted Graphene Quantum Dots for Targeted, Enhanced Tumor Imaging and Long&#8208;Term Visualization of Local Pharmacokinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are in situ planted in a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer of PEGylated nanoparticles from small&#8208;molecule pyrene. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo.








Abstract
While photoluminescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have long been considered very suitable for bioimaging owing to their protein&#8208;like size, superhigh photostability and in vivo long&#8208;term biosafety, their unique and crucial bioimaging applications in vivo remain unreachable. Herein, planted GQDs are presented as an excellent tool for in vivo fluorescent, sustainable and multimodality tumor bioimaging in various scenarios. The GQDs are in situ planted in the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer of PEGylated nanoparticles via a bottom&#8208;up molecular approach to obtain the NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG nanocomposite. The planted GQDs show more than four times prolonged blood circulation and 7&#8211;8 times increased tumor accumulation than typical GQDs in vivo. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo. Planting GQDs in PEGylated nanomedicine offers a new strategy for broad in vivo biomedical applications of GQDs.

         <title>Layered Metal Oxide Nanosheets with Enhanced Interlayer Space for Electrochemical Deionization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered metal oxide with enhanced interlayer spacing is synthesized and employed in electrochemical deionization, achieving high salt adsorption capacity&#160;and adsorption rate, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The electro&#8208;sorption of layered metal oxides originates from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the "memory effect".








Abstract
Electrochemical deionization is regarded as one of the promising water treatment technologies. Here, CoAl&#8208;layered metal oxide nanosheets intercalated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with an enhanced interlayer spacing from 0.76 to 1.33&#160;nm are synthesized and used as an anode. The enlarged interlayer spacing provides an enhanced ion&#8208;diffusion channel and improves the utilization of the interlayer electroactive sites, while heat treatment, transferring layered double hydroxides to layered metal oxides (LMOs), offers additional active oxidation reaction sites to facilitate the electro&#8208;sorption rate, contributing to the high salt adsorption capacity (31.78&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) and average salt adsorption rate (3.75&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1) at 1.2&#160;V in 500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1 NaCl solution. In addition, the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (92.9%) after 40 cycles proves the strong electronic interaction between SDS and the host layer, which is validated by density functional theory calculations later on. Moreover, the electro&#8208;sorption mechanism of LMOs that originated from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the &#8220;memory effect&#8221; is revealed according to the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy peak shifts of Co element. This strategy of expanding the interlayer spacing combined with heat treatment makes LMOs a competitive candidate for electrochemical water deionization.

         <title>Enabling 420&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells by Lanthanum Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal plane regulation strategy for lithium&#160;(Li)&#8208;metal anodes is reported by in&#160;situ&#160;lanthanum (La) doping. La&#8208;doped Li metal enables a preferred crystal plane change to (200) from (110) plane, thereby decreasing the reactivity of Li metal toward electrolytes and establishing a stable interface. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries are achieved under realistic conditions.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#160;metal, a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries, typically grows along the low&#8208;surface energy (110) plane in the plating process, resulting in uncontrollable dendrite growth and unstable interface. Herein, an unexpected Li growth behavior by lanthanum (La) doping is reported: the preferred orientation turns to (200) from (110) plane, enabling 2D nuclei rather than the usual 1D nuclei upon Li deposition and thus forming a dense and dendrite&#8208;free morphology even at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Noticeably, La doping further decreases the reactivity of Li metal toward electrolytes, thereby establishing a stable interface. The dendrite&#8208;free, stable Li anode enables a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.30% at 8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 for asymmetric Li||LaF3&#8211;Cu cells. A 3.1&#160;Ah LaF3&#8211;Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell at a high energy density (425.73&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) with impressive cycling stability (0.0989% decay&#160;per&#160;cycle) under lean electrolyte (1.76&#160;g&#160;Ah&#8722;1) and high cathode loading (5.77&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) using this doped Li anode is further demonstrated.

         <title>Flattening Grain&#8208;Boundary Grooves for Perovskite Solar Cells with High Optomechanical Reliability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain&#8208;boundary grooves are found to have important effects on the properties of perovskite heterointerfaces and thus the device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially, flattening grain&#8208;boundary grooves elevates the (opto&#8208;)mechanical reliability, contributing to device efficiency and stability enhancement.








Abstract
Optomechanical reliability has emerged as an important criterion for evaluating the performance and commercialization potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to the mechanical&#8208;property mismatch of metal halide perovskites with other device layer. In this work, grain&#8208;boundary grooves, a rarely discussed film microstructural characteristic, are found to impart significant effects on the optomechanical reliability of perovskite&#8211;substrate heterointerfaces and thus PSC performance. By pre&#8208;burying iso&#8208;butylammonium chloride additive in the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL), GB grooves (GBGs) are flattened and an optomechanically reliable perovskite heterointerface that resists photothermal fatigue is created. The improved mechanical integrity of the ETL&#8211;perovskite heterointerfaces also benefits the charge transport and chemical stability by facilitating carrier injection and reducing moisture or solvent trapping, respectively. Accordingly, high&#8208;performance PSCs which exhibit efficiency retentions of 94.8% under 440 h damp heat test (85% RH and 85 &#176;C), and 93.0% under 2000 h continuous light soaking are achieved.

         <title>Unveiling Charge&#8208;Transport Mechanisms in Electronic Devices Based on Defect&#8208;Engineered MoS2 Covalent Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent networks of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent an efficient strategy to reduce the interflake junction resistance in thin&#8208;film devices. This multiscale investigation reveals that the molecular structure of the linker is crucial to control the overall charge&#8208;transport mechanisms. This work highlights the great potential of defect engineering for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance devices based on covalent TMD networks.








Abstract
Device performance of solution&#8208;processed 2D semiconductors in printed electronics has been limited so far by structural defects and high interflake junction resistance. Covalently interconnected networks of transition metal dichalcogenides potentially represent an efficient strategy to overcome both limitations simultaneously. Yet, the charge&#8208;transport properties in such systems have not been systematically researched. Here, the charge&#8208;transport mechanisms of printed devices based on covalent MoS2 networks are unveiled via multiscale analysis, comparing the effects of aromatic versus aliphatic dithiolated linkers. Temperature&#8208;dependent electrical measurements reveal hopping as the dominant transport mechanism: aliphatic systems lead to 3D variable range hopping, unlike the nearest neighbor hopping observed for aromatic linkers. The novel analysis based on percolation theory attributes the superior performance of devices functionalized with &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules to the improved interflake electronic connectivity and formation of additional percolation paths, as further corroborated by density functional calculations. Valuable guidelines for harnessing the charge&#8208;transport properties in MoS2 devices based on covalent networks are provided.

         <title>Triclinic&#8208;Phase Bismuth Chromate: A Promising Candidate for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Broad Spectrum Ranges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and crystal structure verification of a novel triclinic bismuth chromate, Bi2CrO6, are reported. Detailed investigations on the electronic structure and the capability of both visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation and reduction reactions, as well as the fabrication of a Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system are reported, demonstrating a huge potential of the triclinic Bi2CrO6 in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting for solar energy conversion remains challenged by the lack of novel semiconductor photocatalysts with paramount parameters including wide light&#8208;harvesting ranges and suitable band structures. Here, a novel triclinic&#8208;phase bismuth chromate (Bi2CrO6) acting as a semiconductor photocatalyst candidate is reported. Triclinic Bi2CrO6 exhibits a broad absorption range of &#8776;650&#160;nm with a direct bandgap of 1.86&#160;eV and shows a suitable band structure for water splitting. Theoretical simulations of triclinic Bi2CrO6 reveal a high charge mobility,&#160;possibly owing to the strong hybridized covalent bonds, large elastic modulus, and small carrier effective mass. The triclinic Bi2CrO6 is demonstrated to work well toward photocatalytic water oxidation and hydrogen production reactions under visible light and match well with its absorption ranges. In particular, it exhibits decent photocatalytic water oxidation performance in the presence of various electron scavengers. Furthermore, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system is fabricated by coupling triclinic Bi2CrO6 as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst with SrTiO3:Rh as the hydrogen evolution photocatalyst, giving a stable overall water splitting with stoichiometric evolution of H2 and O2. This work presents a promising semiconductor material enabling wide&#8208;range light harvesting for photocatalytic and photo&#8208;electrochemical solar energy conversion.

         <title>Highly Reversible Lithium Metal Anode Enabled by 3D Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Dual&#8208;Skeletons</title>

A free&#8208;standing composite Li metal anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) with hierarchical 3D lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons is developed via a facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll mechanical pressing of stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM) and Li&#8208;B alloy. The coupling of micro&#8208;gridding SSM framework and LiB nanofibers enables site&#8208;selective Li stripping/plating processes, achieving excellent cycle performance and practically feasible Li metal anodes.








Abstract
Lithium metal is a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, but its practical application is still hindered by intrinsic defects such as infinite volume expansion and uncontrollable dendrite growth. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free 3D composite Li anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) is prepared by mechanical rolling of lithiophilic LiB nanofibers supported by Li&#8211;B composite and lithiophobic stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM). Featuring hierarchical lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode shows an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.95% and a long lifespan of 900 h under 2 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2. It is demonstrated that the abnormally reversible Li stripping/plating processes should be closely related to the site&#8208;selective plating behavior and spatial confinement effect induced by the robust lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, which alleviates the volume changes, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites, and reduces the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; Li. More importantly, the application feasibility of the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode is also confirmed in full batteries, of which the Li&#8208;B@SSM|LiFePO4 full cell shows a high capacity retention of 97.5% after 400 cycles&#160;while the Li&#8208;B@SSM|S pouch battery exhibits good cycle stability even under practically harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the facile and efficient fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency Li metal anodes toward practical applications.

         <title>Hydrogel with Robust Adhesion in Various Liquid Environments by Electrostatic&#8208;Induced Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Polymer Chains Migration and Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;sensitive hydrogel exhibits robust adhesion in aqueous solution and oil environments by electrostatic&#8208;induced hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains migration and rearrangement, which realizes the removal of the interfacial liquid layer and the effective interfacial bonding during wet adhesion. This polymer&#8208;chains&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for adhesion in liquid environments, broadening the application scenarios of adhesives.








Abstract
Hydrogels with wet adhesion are promising interfacial adhesive materials; however, their adhesion in water, oil, or organic solvents remains a major challenge. To address this, a pressure&#8208;sensitive P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel is fabricated, which exhibits robust adhesion to various substrates in both aqueous solutions and oil environments. It is demonstrated that the key to wet adhesion under liquid conditions is the removal of the interfacial liquid, which can be achieved through rational molecular composition regulation. By complexing with hydrophilic polymer networks, phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is introduced into the hydrogel network as a physical cross&#8208;linker and anchor point to improve the cohesion strength and drive the migration of polymer chains. The migration and rearrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains on the hydrogel surface are induced by the electrostatic interactions of Fe3+, which create a surface with interfacial water&#8208; and oil&#8208;removing properties. By co&#8208;regulating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains, the P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel is able to act as a pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesive under water and oils with adhesion strength of 92.6 and 90.0&#160;kPa, respectively. It is anticipated that this regulation strategy for polymer chains will promote the development of wet adhesion hydrogels, which can have a wide range of applications.

         <title>Comprehensively Understanding the Role of Anion Vacancies on K&#8208;Ion Storage: A Case Study of Se&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered VSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered VSe2 is proposed to reveal the role of anion vacancies on the K+ storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. The results reveal that Se vacancies boost the first potassiation by offering additional K+ adsorption sites and diffusion channels in the intercalation stage and weakening bond strength in the conversion stage. In addition, Se vacancies disappear&#160;after the first potassiation.








Abstract
Anion vacancy engineering (AVE) is widely used to improve the Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. However, AVE is still an emerging strategy in K&#8208;ion batteries, which are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. In addition, the role of anion vacancies on ion storage is far from clear, despite several proposed explanations. Herein, by employing VSe2 as a model conversion&#8208;type anode material, Se vacancies are intentionally introduced (labeled as P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x) to investigate their effect on K+ storage. The P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x shows excellent cyclability in half cells (143&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 3.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles) and high energy density in coin&#8208;type full cells (206.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). By applying various electrochemical techniques, the effects of Se vacancies on the redox potentials of K&#8208;ion insertion/extraction and the K&#8208;ion diffusion in electrodes upon cycling are uncovered. In addition, the structural evolution of Se vacancies during potassiation/de&#8208;potassiation using various operando and ex characterizations is revealed. Moreover, it is demonstrated that Se vacancies can facilitate the breaking of V&#63743;Se bonds upon the P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x conversion using theoretical calculations. This work comprehensively explains the role of anion vacancies in ion storage for developing high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type anode materials.

         <title>A General Strategy to Remove Metal Aggregates toward Metal&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Catalysts with Exclusive Atomic Dispersion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient strategy is developed to obtain metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8211;N&#8211;Cs) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as a high&#8208;temperature etchant to remove excessive crystalline metal aggregates, which eases the identification of the genuine catalytically active sites and enables the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.








Abstract
Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M&#8211;N&#8211;Cs) are promising alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, M&#8211;N&#8211;Cs synthesized by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis frequently suffer from compositional heterogeneity with the simultaneous presence of atomically dispersed M&#8211;Nx sites and crystalline metal nanoparticles (NPs), which hinders the identification of active sites and rational optimization in performance. Herein, a universal and efficient strategy is reported to obtain both precious&#8208; and nonprecious&#8208;metal&#8208;based M&#8211;N&#8211;Cs (M = Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as the etchant to remove excessive metal aggregates at high temperature. Taking Pt&#8211;N&#8211;C as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the complete removal of Pt NPs in Pt&#8211;N&#8211;C enables clarification on the contributions of the atomic Pt&#8211;Nx moieties and Pt NPs to the catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Combined electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations identify that the atomic Pt&#8211;Nx moieties by themselves possess negligible activity, but they can significantly boost the activity of the Pt NPs via the synergistic effect.

         <title>Bistable Joints Enable the Morphing of Hydrogel Sheets with Multistable Configurations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active joints are designed by using a stiff gel as a frame and a responsive gel as an actuating unit. The response mismatch in the joint with in&#8208;plane gradient leads to folding or twisting with the feature of bistability. Integration of multiple joints into one hydrogel enables the formation of multistable configurations that facilitate designs of hydrogel devices with versatile functions.








Abstract
Joints, as a flexing element to connect different parts, are widespread in natural systems. Various joints exist in the body and play crucial roles to execute gestures and gaits. These scenarios have inspired the design of mechanical joints with passive, hard materials, which usually need an external power supply to drive the transformations. The incorporation of soft and active joints provides a modular strategy to devise soft actuators and robots. However, transformations of responsive joints under external stimuli are usually in uni&#8208;mode with a pre&#8208;determined direction. Here, hydrogel joints capable of folding and twisting transformation in bi&#8208;mode are reported, which enable the composite hydrogel to form multiple configurations under constant conditions. These joints have an in&#8208;plane gradient structure and comprise stiff, passive gel as the frame and soft, active gel as the actuating unit. Under external stimuli, the response mismatch between different gels leads to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane folding or twisting deformation with the feature of bistability. These joints can be modularly integrated with other gels to afford complex deformations and multistable configurations. This approach favors selective control of hydrogel's architectures and versatile design of hydrogel devices, as demonstrated by proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. It shall also merit the development of metamaterials, soft actuators, and robots, etc.

         <title>Ultrasmooth and Dense Lithium Deposition Toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmooth and dense lithium &#160;deposition is achieved by ingenious synergy of vertically aligned nanosheet arrays and ultrathin Li2S&#8208;rich solid&#160;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Specifically, nanosheet arrays possess the proper surface area to reduce local current density and avoid excessive side reactions. Moreover, moveable Li2S&#8208;rich SEI with electronically insulating properties can homogenize lithium&#8208;ion flux and inhibit electron escape to avoid electrolyte decomposition.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with stable solid&#160;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendrite&#8208;free formation have great potential in next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Here, vertically aligned 3D Cu2S nanosheet arrays are&#160;fabricated&#160;on the surface of commercial Cu foils, which in&#160;situ generate ultrathin Cu nanosheet arrays to reduce local current density and Li2S layers on the surfaces to work as an&#160;excellent artificial SEI. It is found that Li presents a 3D&#8208;to&#8208;planar deposition model, and Li2S layers are reversibly movable between the&#160;3D nanosheet surface and 2D planar surface of Li during long&#8208;term cycling. This enables ultrasmooth and dense Li deposition at 1&#160;mA cm&#8208;2, presenting an average thickness of &#8776;53.0&#160;&#181;m at 10 mAh cm&#8208;2, which is close to the theoretical Li foil thickness and is highly reversible at different cycles. Thus, 1150 stable cycles with high Coulombic efficiency (CE, 99.1%) at ether&#8208;based electrolytes and 300 stable cycles with high CE (98.8%) at carbonate electrolytes are realized in half&#8208;cell with a capacity of 1 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2. When coupled with commercial cathodes (LiFePO4 or LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2), the full cells present substantially enhanced cyclability under high cathode loading, limited (or zero) Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions, even at &#8722;20 &#176;C.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#63743;N5 Sites Immobilized on g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets for Ultrasensitive Selective Detection of Phenanthrene by Dual Ratiometric Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites are immobilized on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets for detecting phenanthrene (PHE) by dual ratiometric fluorescence with ultrahigh sensitivity (limit of detection = 0.35 ng L&#8722;1) and selectivity among typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to favorable selective adsorption of PHE on as&#8208;constructed atomic Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites via the ionic cation&#8211;&#960; interactions (Zn&#948;+&#63743;C2&#948;&#8722; type).








Abstract
Ultrasensitively selective detection of trace polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like phenanthrene (PHE) is critical but remains challenging. Herein, atomically dispersed Zn sites on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (sZn&#8208;CN) are constructed by thermal polymerization of a Zn&#8211;cyanuric acid&#8211;melamine supramolecular precursor for the fluorescence detection of PHE. A high amount (1.6 wt%) of sZn is grafted in the cave of CN with one N vacancy in the form of unique Zn(II)&#63743;N5 coordination. The optimized sZn&#8208;CN achieves a wide detection range (1 ng L&#8722;1 to 5 mg L&#8722;1), ultralow detection limit (0.35 ng L&#8722;1, with 5&#8208;order magnitude improvement over CN), and ultrahigh selectivity toward PHE even among typical PAHs based on the built PHE&#8208;CN dual ratiometric fluorescence method. By means of in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved absorption&#160;and fluorescence spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations, the resulting superior detection performance is attributed to the favorable selective adsorption of PHE on as&#8208;constructed atomic Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites via the ionic cation&#8211;&#960; interactions (Zn&#948;+&#63743;C2&#948;&#8722; type), and the fluorescence quenching is dominated by the inner filter effect (IFE) from the multilayer adsorption of PHE at low concentrations, while it is done by the protruded photogenerated electron&#8208;transfer process, as well as IFE from the monolayer adsorption of PHE at ultralow concentration.

By means of in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, time-resolved absorption&#160;and fluorescence spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations, the resulting superior detection performance is attributed to the favorable selective adsorption of PHE on as-constructed atomic Zn(II)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; sites via the ionic cation&#8211;&#960; interactions (Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; type), and the fluorescence quenching is dominated by the inner filter effect (IFE) from the multilayer adsorption of PHE at low concentrations, while it is done by the protruded photogenerated electron-transfer process, as well as IFE from the monolayer adsorption of PHE at ultralow concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Plasmonic&#8208;Nanogap Particles
Plasmonic&#8208;nanogap particles offer a highly enhanced electromagnetic field inside the gap, which is useful for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;based sensing applications. In article number 2208250, Jwa&#8208;Min Nam and co&#8208;workers report the design and synthesis of plasmonic dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbell particles with an open gap. Analytes such as DNA can diffuse into this gap for dye&#8208;free molecular sensing with SERS signals.

Charge&#8208;Transport Mechanisms
A multiscale investigation of the charge&#8208;transport mechanisms in covalently interconnected networks of MoS2 nanosheets is presented by Paolo Samor&#236; and co&#8208;workers in article number 2211157. The chemical structure of the dithiolated bridging linker is critical, with &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems outperforming aliphatic molecules thereby boosting interflake transport. These findings highlight the great potential of defect engineering for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance MoS2 devices.

Dendrite&#8208;Free Metal Batteries
In article number 2210447, Yong Cheng, Quanfeng Dong, Ming&#8208;Sheng Wang, and co&#8208;workers reveal the Na/K plating/stripping behaviors in carbon capsules with open mesochannels by in situ electron microscopy. These mesochannels can boost surface ion diffusion, and, after metal filling, they become superfast channels for Na/K transport via interfacial diffusion. Such pore&#8208;modified carbon hosts enable dendrite&#8208;free sodium deposition and superior high&#8208;rate performance for future large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage.

         <title>A Biomolecular Toolbox for Precision Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomotors are a new and exciting field of research for biomedical applications. Many diverse nanomotor systems have been studied in recent years with great promise. Precision targeting of nanomotors is necessary for translation from the laboratory to the clinic. A biomolecular toolbox to achieve precision targeting is presented, consisting of targeting molecules, conjugation strategies, and extracellular targets.








Abstract
The application of nanomotors for cancer diagnosis and therapy is a new and exciting area of research, which when combined with precision nanomedicine, promises to solve many of the issues encountered by previous development of passive nanoparticles. The goal of this article is to introduce nanomotor and nanomedicine researchers to the deep pool of knowledge available regarding cancer cell biology and biochemistry, as well as provide a greater appreciation of the complexity of cell membrane compositions, extracellular surfaces, and their functional consequences. A short description of the nanomotor state&#8208;of&#8208;art for cancer therapy and diagnosis is first provided, as well as recommendations for future directions of the field. Then, a biomolecular targeting toolbox has been collated for researchers looking to apply their nanomaterial of choice to a biological setting, as well as providing a glimpse into currently available clinical therapies and technologies. This toolbox contains an overview of different classes of targeting molecules available for high affinity and specific targeting and cell surface targets to aid researchers in the selection of a clinical disease model and targeting methodology. It is hoped that this review will provide biological context, inspiration, and direction to future nanomotor and nanomedicine research.

         <title>A Review on Regulating Li+ Solvation Structures in Carbonate Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of carbonate electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is highly influenced by the solvation structure of Li+. A comprehensive overview of strategies is presented for regulating the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes to improve Li+ behavior and the performance of LMBs. The remaining questions and perspectives for advanced carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are also outlined.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation battery systems due to their high energy density. However, commercialized carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anodes. While increasing cut&#8208;off voltage is an effective way to boost the energy density of LMBs, conventional ethylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes undergo a number of side reactions at high voltages. It is therefore critical to upgrade conventional carbonate electrolytes, the performance of which is highly influenced by the solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies to regulate the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes for LMBs by better understanding the science behind the Li+ solvation structure and Li+ behavior. Different strategies are systematically compared to help select better electrolytes for specific applications. The remaining scientific and technical problems are pointed out, and directions for future research on carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are proposed.

         <title>Optically Tunable Transient Plasmons in InSb Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrow bandgap and small electron effective mass enable InSb to support plasmons with sensitive optical tunability in the mid&#8208;infrared region. By using the time&#8208;resolved optical nanoscopy, the resonance plasmon is successfully switched in an individual InSb nanowire. By controlling the photoinduced electron yield, a sensitive modulation of the plasmon frequency is achieved by one octave.








Abstract
Optical carrier incubation can effectively alter the electron transport properties of semiconductors; thus, optical switching of the plasmonic response of the semiconductor enables the ultrafast manipulation of the light at the nanoscale. Semiconductor nanostructures are promising platforms in on&#8208;chip high&#8208;speed plasmonic devices, owing to their high photoinduced electron injection efficiency at sub&#8208;picosecond and compatibility with contemporary semiconductor technologies. The pure single crystalline InSb nanowires are promising plasmonic materials in the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their high electron mobility and small electron effective mass. Here, the pump&#8211;probe nanoscopy is utilized to investigate the pump fluence dependency and the dynamics of the non&#8208;equilibrium plasmons in the InSb nanowires. The InSb plasmon is successfully switched by injecting the photoinduced electrons and the practical tuning of the plasmon frequency to one octave is shown by increasing the pump fluence from 0 to 90&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. The density of the photoinduced electrons in InSb nanowires is 18.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1018&#160;cm&#8722;3 with pump fluence as low as 90&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. The high electron mobility of the InSb supports the low&#8208;loss plasmon with a damping rate of &#8776;200&#160;cm&#8722;1. The InSb nanowires&#8217; excellent plasmonic properties ensure that they are a promising platform for upcoming high&#8208;speed mid&#8208;infrared plasmonic materials for informatic devices.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Fusion&#8208;Mediated Multiplex Engineering of Tumor Cell Surface Glycans for Enhanced NK Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome is designed to fuse with tumor cell membrane to deliver sialyltransferase inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm and anchor natural killer (NK)&#8208;activating glycan&#8208;modified shell onto surface synchronously. This membrane&#8208;fusion&#8208;mediated delivery approach reprograms the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface into a Lewis X trisaccharide&#8208;based NK&#8208;activating type, sufficiently reactivating the NK recognition and lysis for enhanced antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but are immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing tumor cell surface glycans. To reverse this glycan&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, the surface NK&#8208;inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and NK&#8208;activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal efficiency. Here, a core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome (MFL) is designed to simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK&#8208;activating glycans and biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via a membrane&#8208;fusion manner. Loaded into a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;triggered&#8208;degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver sialyltransferase&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor NK&#8208;activating&#8208;glycan&#8208;modified shell onto tumor surface. This spatially&#8208;differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK&#8208;activating Lewis X trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface is reprogrammed to be LeX&#8208;induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL provides a novel platform for multiplex&#160;cell engineering and personalized regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Construction of Fluorinated Propane&#8208;Trap in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Record Polymer&#8208;Grade Propylene Production under High Humidity Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the incorporation of &#63743;CF3 groups into the confined pore space, the constructed fluorinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit benchmark C3H8/C3H6 separation potential with strong C3H8 binding affinity over C3H6 and exceptional C3H8 uptake capacity. Moreover, the MOFs exhibit high hydrophobicity and good moisture stability, indicating potential applications in efficient C3H8/C3H6 separation under actual conditions with vapour.








Abstract
Propane/propene (C3H8/C3H6) separation is essential in the petrochemical industry but challenging because of their similar physical and chemical properties. Adsorptive separation with C3H8&#8208;selective porous materials can energy&#8208;efficiently produce high&#8208;purity C3H6, which is highly promising for replacing conventional cryogenic distillation but suffers from unsatisfactory performance. Herein, through the precise incorporation of fluorinated functional groups into the confined pore space, a new fluorinated metal&#8211;organic framework&#160;(FDMOF&#8208;2) featuring the unique and strong C3H8&#8208;trap is successfully constructed. FDMOF&#8208;2 exhibits an unprecedented C3H8 capture capacity of 140 cm3 cm&#8722;3 and excellent C3H8/C3H6 (1:1, v/v) selectivity up to 2.18 (298 K and 1&#160;bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported porous materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that the tailored pore confinement in FDMOF&#8208;2 provides stronger and multiple attractive interactions with C3H8, enabling excellent binding affinities. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that C3H8 can be directly extracted from various C3H8/C3H6 mixtures with FDMOF&#8208;2, affording an outstanding C3H6 production (501&#160;mmol L&#8722;1) with over 99.99% purity. Benefiting from the robust framework and hydrophobic ligands, the separation performance of FDMOF&#8208;2 can be well maintained even under 70% relative humidity conditions.

         <title>Enhanced Spin Current in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx Bilayer with Top and Sideways Oxidization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sizeable spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations based on the spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion can be manipulated by changing the annealing temperature, time, and the Hall&#8208;bar channel width, providing a novel approach to developing efficient spintronic devices.








Abstract
Generation and manipulation of spin current are the cores of spintronic devices, which are intensely pursued. Heavy metals with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling are commonly used for the generation of spin current, but are&#160;incompatible with the mass production of devices, and the polarization of spin current is limited to be in&#8208;plane. Here, it is shown that the spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion efficiency can be enhanced through the spin currents consisting of both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;z) and in&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;y) induced by spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. Such a spin current is demonstrated to be closely related to the lateral oxidization gradient and can be controlled by changing the temperatures and times of annealing. The finding here provides a novel degree of freedom to produce and control the spin current in spintronic devices.

         <title>Sound&#8208;Speed Modifying Acoustic Metasurfaces for Acoustic Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin metasurface approach utilizing planarized micropillars in discrete phase arrays is demonstrated, and&#160;which is easily fabricated by a&#160;single&#8208;step etching process. This metasurface demonstrates flexibility in the generation of complex acoustic patterns by acoustic holography and has broad potential in applications including high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation in microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering, and medical ultrasound.








Abstract
Acoustic metasurfaces offer unique capabilities to steer and direct acoustic fields, though these are generally composed of complex 3D structures, complicating their fabrication and applicability to higher frequencies. Here, an ultrathin metasurface approach is demonstrated,&#160;wherein&#160;planarized micropillars in a discretized phase array&#160;are&#160;utilized. This subwavelength metasurface is easily produced via a single&#8208;step etching process and is suitable for megahertz&#8208;scale applications. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated in the production of complex acoustic patterns via acoustic holography. This metasurface approach, with models used to predict their behavior, has broad potential in applications where robust, high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation is required, including microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering, and medical ultrasound.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Guided In Situ Genetic Engineering of Macrophages for Sustained Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An X&#8208;ray&#8208;guided and triggered remote control of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome&#8208;editing strategy is reported, to specifically and permanently repolarize TAMs toward M1 phenotype without reconversion by blocking CSF1&#8208;R and SIRP&#945; expressions both in vitro and in vivo, thereby inducing the phagocytosis of tumor cells and eliciting robust antitumor immunity, while reducing systemic toxicities.








Abstract
Effective repolarization of macrophages has emerged as a promising approach for anticancer therapy. However, there are very few studies on the effect of reprogramming macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype without reconversion while maintaining an activated M1 phenotype. Moreover, these immunomodulatory methods have serious drawbacks due to the activation of normal monocytic cells. Therefore, it remains a challenge to selectively reprogram tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) without systemic toxicities. Here, X&#8208;ray&#8208;guided and triggered remote control of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (X&#8208;CC9) that exclusively activates therapeutic agents at tumor sites is established. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, X&#8208;CC9 selectively enhances M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 repolarization within the tumor microenvironment, and significantly improves antitumor efficacy with robust immune responses in two animal models. This strategy provides an ideal method for improving the safety of macrophage polarization and may constitute a promising immunotherapy strategy.

         <title>Simultaneous Oxidative Cleavage of Lignin and Reduction of Furfural via Efficient Electrocatalysis by P&#8208;Doped CoMoO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced lattice growth of CoMoO4 increases crystal defects and causes the D&#8208;band center to migrate higher to obtain the appropriate adsorption energy and significantly lower overpotential, therefore this system performs well in lignin oxidation breakage and furfural reduction.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidative lignin cleavage and coupled 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction provide a promising approach for producing high&#8208;value added products. However, developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;like activity still remains a challenge. Here, an efficient electrochemical strategy is reported for the selective oxidative cleavage of C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; bonds in lignin into aromatic monomers by tailoring the electronic structure through P&#8208;doped CoMoO4 spinels (99% conversion, highest monomer selectivity of 56%). Additionally, the conversion and selectivity of 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction to 2&#8208;methyl furan reach 87% and 73%, respectively. In situ Fourier transform infrared and density functional theory analysis reveal that an upward shift of the Ed upon P&#8208;doping leads to an increase in the antibonding level, which facilitates the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; adsorption of the lignin model compounds, thereby enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the active site. This work explores the potential of a spinel as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxidative cracking of lignin and the reductive conversion of small organic molecules to high&#8208;value added chemicals via P&#8208;anion modulation.

     alt="Simultaneous Oxidative Cleavage of Lignin and Reduction of Furfural via Efficient Electrocatalysis by P-Doped CoMoO4"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P-doping-induced lattice growth of CoMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; increases crystal defects and causes the D-band center to migrate higher to obtain the appropriate adsorption energy and significantly lower overpotential, therefore this system performs well in lignin oxidation breakage and furfural reduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical oxidative lignin cleavage and coupled 2-furaldehyde reduction provide a promising approach for producing high-value added products. However, developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with noble-metal-like activity still remains a challenge. Here, an efficient electrochemical strategy is reported for the selective oxidative cleavage of C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt; bonds in lignin into aromatic monomers by tailoring the electronic structure through P-doped CoMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; spinels (99% conversion, highest monomer selectivity of 56%). Additionally, the conversion and selectivity of 2-furaldehyde reduction to 2-methyl furan reach 87% and 73%, respectively. In situ Fourier transform infrared and density functional theory analysis reveal that an upward shift of the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; upon P-doping leads to an increase in the antibonding level, which facilitates the C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption of the lignin model compounds, thereby enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the active site. This work explores the potential of a spinel as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxidative cracking of lignin and the reductive conversion of small organic molecules to high-value added chemicals via P-anion modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Melt Electrowriting of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Scaffolds with Programmed Mechanical Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt electrowriting of liquid crystal elastomers is developed to generate ultrafine fibers with built&#8208;in digitally&#160;defined anisotropy. Square lattice&#160;and other more complex scaffolds with structural features and dimensions hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques, as well as mechanical response to temperature, are demonstrated with this technique.








Abstract
Recently, significant advances have been achieved to precisely program the response of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) through extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing techniques; however, important challenges remain, especially when well&#8208;defined scaffolds based on ultrafine fibers are required. Here the melt electrowriting of reactive liquid crystalline inks, leading, after ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;induced crosslinking, to digitally positioned uniform LCE fibers with diameters ranging from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers is presented, which&#160;is&#160;hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques. The electrowriting process induces the preferential alignment of the mesogens parallel to the fiber's axis. Such an alignment, defined by the printing path, determines the mechanical response of the crosslinked material upon stimulation. This manufacturing platform allows the preparation of open square lattice scaffolds with ultrafine fibers (a&#160;few micrometers in diameter), periods as small as 90&#160;&#181;m, and well&#8208;defined morphology. Additionally, the combination of accurate fiber stacking (up to 50 layers) and fiber fusion between layers leads to unprecedented microstructures composed of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio LCE thin walls. The possibility of digitally controlling the printing of fibers allows the preparation complex fiber&#8208;based scaffolds with programmed and reversible shape&#8208;morphing, thus opening new avenues to prepare miniaturized actuators and smart structures for soft robotics and biomedical applications.

         <title>Substitutional p&#8208;Type Doping in NbS2&#8211;MoS2 Lateral Heterostructures Grown by MOCVD</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type NbS2&#8211;MoS2 lateral heterostructures with a high on/off current ratio are synthesized by a&#160;one&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method with Nb dopants present in the&#160;monolayer MoS2. The heterostructure provides a platform to explore the instructive interface of substitutional doped TMDC materials and 2D metal&#8211;semiconductor heterojunctions, which paves a prospective way to designing innovative nanoscale devices and complementary&#160;metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#160;(CMOS)&#8208;like 2D circuits.








Abstract
Monolayer MoS2 has attracted significant attention owing to its excellent performance as an n&#8208;type semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) family. It is however strongly desired to develop controllable synthesis methods for 2D p&#8208;type MoS2, which is crucial for complementary logic applications but remains difficult. In this work, high&#8208;quality NbS2&#8211;MoS2 lateral heterostructures are synthesized by one&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) together with monolayer MoS2 substitutionally doped by Nb, resulting in a p&#8208;type doped behavior. The heterojunction shows a p&#8208;type transfer characteristic with a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;104, exceeding previously reported values. The band structure through the NbS2&#8211;MoS2 heterojunction is investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and quantum transport simulations. This work provides a scalable approach to synthesize substitutionally doped TMDC materials and provides an insight into the interface between 2D metals and semiconductors in lateral heterostructures, which is imperative for the development of next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics and highly integrated devices.

         <title>Reconfigurable Electrical Networks within a Conductive Hydrogel Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft conductors coupled with reversible electrical conductivity can enable new functions in wearable electronics and soft robotics. In&#160;this&#160;work, a reconfigurable conductive hydrogel composite is developed, which is made of silver flakes, polyacrylamide, and alginate hydrogel. By simply applying dehydration and rehydration treatments, the material can achieve reversible electrical conductivity. This reconfigurability can help the material to recover from severe damage or control locomotion of a legged robot.








Abstract
Soft materials that exhibit compliance, programmability, and reconfigurability can have a transformative impact as electronic skin for applications in wearable electronics/soft robotics. There has been significant progress in soft conductive materials; however, achieving electrically&#160;controlled and reversible changes in conductivity and circuit connectivity remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, a&#160;soft material architecture with reconfigurable conductive networks of silver flakes embedded within a hydrogel matrix is presented. The conductive networks can be reversibly created/disconnected through various stimuli, including current, humidity, or temperature. Such stimuli affect electrical connectivity of the hydrogel by controlling its water content, which can be modulated by evaporation under ambient conditions (passive dehydration), evaporation through electrical Joule heating (active dehydration), or absorption of additional water (rehydration). The resulting change in electrical conductivity is reversible and repeatable, endowing the composite with on&#8208;demand reconfigurable conductivity. To highlight this material's unique properties, it is shown that conductive traces can be reconfigured after severe damage and revert to lower conductivity after rehydration. Additionally, a quadruped robot is demonstrated that can respond to stimuli by changing direction following exposure to excess water, thereby achieving reprogrammable locomotion behaviors.

         <title>Scalable Manufacturing of Mechanical Robust Bioinspired Ceramic&#8211;Resin Composites with Locally Tunable Heterogeneous Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a simple bottom&#8208;up assembly approach, nacre&#8208;like ceramic&#8211;resin composites with tunable heterogeneous architectures are scalably manufactured. The composites are designed with a strong and tough nacre&#8208;like main body, and a stiff and hard surface layer bonded by a gradient interlayer to alleviate property mismatch. This structural design achieves an impressive combination of low density and multiple desired mechanical properties.








Abstract
Lightweight structural materials with a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, toughness, and hardness, are highly&#160;desired yet challenging to be artificially fabricated. Biological structural materials, on the other hand, ingeniously integrate multiple mutually exclusive mechanical properties together relying on their hierarchically heterogeneous structures bonded with gradient interfaces. Here, a scalable bottom&#8208;up approach combining continuous nanofiber&#8208;assisted evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly with laminating, pressure&#8208;less sintering and resin infiltration is reported to fabricate bioinspired heterogeneous ceramic&#8211;resin composites with locally&#160;tunable microstructure to fulfill specific properties. A gradient interlayer is&#160;introduced to provide a gradual transition between adjacent heterogeneous layers, effectively alleviating their property mismatch. The optimized heterogeneous nacre&#8208;like composite, as a demonstration, exhibits an attractive combination of low density (&#8776;2.8&#160;g&#160;cm&#8722;3), high strength (&#8776;292&#160;MPa), toughness (&#8776;6.4&#160;MPa&#160;m1/2), surface hardness (&#8776;1144 kgf&#160;mm&#8722;2) and impact&#8208;resistance, surpassing the overall performance of engineering alumina. This material&#8208;independent approach paves the way for designing advanced bioinspired heterogeneous materials for diverse structural and functional applications.

This material-independent approach paves the way for designing advanced bioinspired heterogeneous materials for diverse structural and functional applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water Spider&#8208;Inspired Nanofiber Coating with Sustainable Scale Repellency via Air&#8208;Replenishing Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by water spiders, an underwater superaerophilic nanofiber coating is developed to display excellent and sustainable scalephobic capability. Through appropriate replenishment, air film on the coating can be well stabilized and serves as a barrier layer to reduce the deposition of scale. Compared with reported results, the water spider&#8208;inspired coating significantly surpasses them in both longevity and efficiency.








Abstract
To survive underwater even in severely hypoxic water for a long period, the&#160;water spider has to periodically collect and replenish air into the diving bell. Inspired by this natural air&#8208;replenishing strategy, a water spider&#8208;inspired nanofiber (WSN) coating with underwater superaerophilicity displaying excellent and sustainable scalephobic capability is prepared. Air film on the WSN coating can be well&#8208;kept and further employed as the barrier layer for scale repellence. Significantly, scalephobic capability of the WSN coating mainly originates from two aspects: inhibiting interfacial nucleation and reducing interfacial adhesion of scale. Compared with previous studies, this WSN coating achieves excellent and sustainable scale repellence (&#8776; 98% reduction in scale deposition) even after a one&#8208;month dynamic scaling test. Thus, this air&#8208;replenishing strategy may raise a new avenue for advanced long&#8208;term scalephobic materials.

         <title>Extracting Polaron Recombination from Electroluminescence in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extraction of polaron dynamics from EL in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes is realized by AI. The quantitative understanding of polaron dynamics in complicated light&#8208;emitting processes is facilitated by predicting the recombination coefficient.








Abstract
Direct exploring the electroluminescence (EL) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is a challenge due to the complicated processes of polarons, excitons, and their interactions. This study demonstrated the extraction of the polaron dynamics from transient EL by predicting the recombination coefficient via artificial intelligence, overcoming multivariable kinetics problems. The performance of a machine learning (ML) model trained by various EL decay curves is significantly improved using a novel featurization method and input node optimization, achieving an R2 value of 0.947. The optimized ML model successfully predicts the recombination coefficients of actual OLEDs based on an exciplex&#8208;forming cohost, enabling the quantitative understanding of the overall polaron behavior under various electrical excitation conditions.

         <title>Orthogonal Photochemistry toward Direct Encryption of a 3D&#8208;Printed Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encryption on a 3D hydrogel is achieved by orthogonal photochemistry. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;based 3D printing can fabricate hydrogels into complex geometries, and the further UV irradiation is employed to encode the information on the gel surface. This strategy for product anti&#8208;counterfeiting with high security paves the way for more reliable encryption.








Abstract
Encryption technologies are essential for information security and product anti&#8208;counterfeiting, but they are typically restricted to planar surfaces. Encryption on complex 3D objects offers great potential to further improve security. However, it is rarely achieved owing to the lack of encoding strategies for nonplanar surfaces. Here, an approach is reported to directly encrypt on a 3D&#8208;printed object employing orthogonal photochemistry. In this system, visible light photochemistry is used for 3D printing of a hydrogel, and ultraviolet light is subsequently employed to activate its geometrically complex surface through the dissociation of ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester units in a spatioselective manner for information coding. This approach offers a new way for more reliable encryption, and the underlying orthogonal photochemistry can be extended toward functional modification of 3D&#8208;printed products beyond information protection.

         <dc:description>
A novel quaternary p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor, CuBiP2Se6, is introduced into the 2D family, exhibiting a high work function of 5.26&#160;eV, hole mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and ultrahigh on/off ratio exceeding 106. In particular, CuBiP2Se6&#8208;based fully vertical van der Waals devices exhibit outstanding comprehensive optoelectronic performance, which is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices.








Abstract
The notable lack of intrinsic p&#8208;type 2D layered semiconductors has hindered the engineering of 2D devices for complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOSs). Herein, a novel quaternary intrinsic p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor, CuBiP2Se6 atomic layers, is introduced into&#160;the&#160;2D family. The semiconductor displays a high work function of 5.26&#160;eV, a moderate hole mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and an ultrahigh on/off current exceeding 106 at room temperature. To date, 5.26&#160;eV is the highest work&#8208;function recorded in p&#8208;type 2D materials, indicating the ultrastable p&#8208;type behavior of CuBiP2Se6. Additionally, a multilayer graphene/CuBiP2Se6/multilayer graphene (MLG/CBPS/MLG)&#8208;based fully vertical van der Waals heterostructure phototransistor is designed and fabricated. This device exhibits outstanding optoelectronic performance with a responsivity (R) of 4.9 &#215;&#160;104 A W&#8722;1, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.5 &#215;&#160;107%, a detectivity (D) of 1.14 &#215;&#160;1013 Jones, and a broad working wavelength (400&#8211;1100&#160;nm), respectively. This is comparable&#160;to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices. Such excellent performance is attributed to the ultrashort transmit length and nondestructive/defect&#8208;free contacts. This leads to faster response speed and eliminates Fermi&#8208;level&#160;pinning&#160;effects. Moreover, ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity endow the device with applaudable imaging sensing capability. These results make CuBiP2Se6 an ideal p&#8208;type candidate material for next&#8208;generation CMOSs logic devices.

         <title>Orally Administrable H2S&#8208;Scavenging Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by Co&#8208;Flow Microfluidics for Comprehensive Restoration of Intestinal Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform is synthesized to scavenge and detect H2S to recover intestinal barrier damaged by inflammatory bowel diseases. Nanoplatform is prepared by encapsulation of UiO&#8208;66 with a CR probe (UR) in pH&#8208;responsive hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) done via microfluidic. Following oral administration, HPMCAS dissolves to expose UR NPs at the inflamed intestine which adsorbs and detects H2S.








Abstract
Intestinal milieu disorders are strongly related to the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which results from mucosa destruction, epithelium disruption, and tight junction (TJ) proteins loss. Excess of H2S in the intestinal milieu produced by the&#160;sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria metabolism contributes to&#160;development of&#160;IBDs via epithelial barrier breakdown. Conventional interventions, such as surgery and anti&#8208;inflammatory medications, are considered not completely effective because of frequent recurrence and other complications. Herein, a novel oral delivery system, a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66) with a Cux&#8208;rhodamine B (CR) probe (hereinafter referred to as HUR), is produced via&#160;a&#160;co&#8208;flow microfluidic approach with the ability to reduce H2S levels, thus restoring the intestinal lumen milieu. HPMCAS serves as an enteric coating that exposes UiO&#8208;66@CR at the pH of the intestine but not the acidic pH of the stomach. The synthesized HUR exhibits notable therapeutic efficacy, including mucosa recovery, epithelium integrity restoration, and TJ proteins upregulation via H2S scavenging to protect against intestinal barrier damage and microbiome dysbiosis. Thus, HUR is verified to be a promising theranostic platform able to decrease the H2S content for intestinal milieu disorder treatment. The presented study therefore opens the door for further exploitation for IBDs therapy.

         <title>A&#160;pH&#8208;Activatable Copper&#8208;Biomineralized Proenzyme for Synergistic Chemodynamic/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy against Aggressive Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxidase&#8208;like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH&#8208;NCs) are&#160;found&#160;to&#160;act as a pH&#8208;activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor&#8208;selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against aggressive triple&#8208;negative breast cancers (TNBCs).








Abstract
Artificial enzymes have demonstrated therapeutic benefits against diverse malignant tumors, yet their antitumor potencies are still severely compromised by non&#8208;selective catalysis, low atomic&#8208;utilization efficiency, and undesired off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, it is reported that peroxidase&#8208;like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH&#8208;NCs) act as a pH&#8208;activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor&#8208;selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against aggressive triple&#8208;negative breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH&#8208;NCs show pH&#8208;sensitive Cu2+ release, which spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated reduction into Cu+ species for catalyzing the evolution of H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH)&#160;in a single&#8208;atom&#8208;like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously activates non&#8208;toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell apoptosis. CuCH&#8208;NCs exhibit considerable tumor&#8208;targeting capacity with deep penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast tumors&#160;through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo safety. Moreover, CuCH&#8208;NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with relieving immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and high&#8208;performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation on Photocatalysts with Ferroelectric Single Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;prepared BiFeO3 nanosheets are confirmed as ferroelectric single domains, and their potential in photocatalysis is identified by comparison&#160;with polydomain particles. Selective deposition of cocatalysts further boosts the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain BiFeO3 nanosheets. The superiority of the&#160;single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts is emphasized, which offers a path to utilize the energetic photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials are considered as promising photocatalysts due to their efficient charge separation via a&#160;polarization&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field. However, the polydomain structures hinder spatial charge separation and transfer due to the cancellation of polarization vectors in the domains. In&#160;this&#160;work, taking BiFeO3 (BFO) as a prototype, single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets with visible&#8208;light absorption are prepared, as evident by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SRSPS), and photodeposition experiments. The single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets show nine times activity in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with that of the polydomain BFO particles. With the asymmetric driving force for charge separation in a single domain, selective deposition of cocatalysts further enhances the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain ferroelectric BFO nanosheets. These results demonstrate the role of the&#160;single&#8208;domain structure in constructing the driving force of charge separation in ferroelectric photocatalysts. The fabrication of single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity offers a path to efficiently utilize the photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.

         <title>Controlled Adhesion of Ice&#8212;Toward Ultraclean 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ice&#8208;aided transfer, ice&#8208;stamp transfer, and ice cleaning methods, completely free from polymer and solvents, are developed to yield ultrahigh quality and exceptional cleanliness in 2D materials, which&#160;will&#160;contribute&#160;to technological revolutions in 2D materials, and their associated structures and devices.








Abstract
The scalable 2D&#160;device fabrication and integration demand either the large&#8208;area synthesis or the post&#8208;synthesis transfer of 2D layers. While the direct synthesis of 2D materials on most targeted surfaces remains challenging, the transfer approach from the growth substrate onto the targeted surfaces offers an alternative pathway for applications and integrations. However, the current transfer techniques for 2D materials predominantly involve polymers and organic solvents, which are liable to contaminate or deform the ultrasensitive atomic layers. Here, novel ice&#8208;aided transfer and ice&#8208;stamp transfer methods are developed, in which water (ice) is the only medium in the entire process. In practice, the adhesion between various 2D materials and ice can be well controlled by temperature. Through such controlled adhesion of ice, it is shown that the new transfer methods can yield ultrahigh quality and exceptional cleanliness in transferred 2D flakes and continuous 2D films, and are applicable for a wide range of substrates. Furthermore, beyond transfer, ice can also be used for cleaning the surfaces of 2D materials at higher temperatures. These novel techniques can enable unprecedented ultraclean 2D materials surfaces and performances, and will contribute to the upcoming technological revolutions associated with 2D materials.

Active fabrics, responding autonomously to environmental changes, are the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of the development of smart textiles. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) promise to be the base materials for large&#8208;stroke reversible actuation. The mechanical behavior of LCEs matches almost exactly the human muscle. Yet, it has not been&#160;possible to produce filaments from LCEs that will be suitable for standard textile production methods, such as weaving. Based on the recent development of LCE fibers, here, the crafting of active fabrics incorporating LCE yarn, woven on a standard loom, giving control over the weave density and structure, is presented. Two types of LCE yarns (soft and stiff) and their incorporation into several weaving patterns are tested, and the &#8220;champions&#8221; identified: the twill pattern with stiffer LCE yarn that shows the greatest blocking force of 1&#8211;2&#160;N&#160;cm&#8722;1 , and the weft rib pattern with over 10% reversible actuation strain on repeated heating cycles. Reversible 3D shape changes of active fabric utilize the circular weaving patterns that lead to cone shapes upon heating. The seamless combination of active LCE yarns into the rich portfolio of existing passive yarns can be transformative in creating new stimuli&#8208;responsive actuating textiles.

         <title>Ambient Electrosynthesis toward Single&#8208;Atom Sites for Electrocatalytic Green Hydrogen Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress in ambient electrosynthesis toward single&#8208;atom sites ranging from nonprecious Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, V, Cr, Mn, Sn, Pd, and Bi to noble Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au for green hydrogen cycling is reviewed, and further opportunities are discussed. Three electrosynthesis strategies including electrochemical etching, direct electrodeposition, and electrochemical leaching&#8211;redeposition&#160;are&#160;summarized.








Abstract
With the ultimate atomic utilization, well&#8208;defined configuration of active sites and unique electronic properties, catalysts with single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) exhibit appealing performance for electrocatalytic green hydrogen generation from water splitting and further utilization via hydrogen&#8211;oxygen fuel cells, such that a vast majority of synthetic strategies toward SAS&#8208;based catalysts (SASCs) are exploited. In particular, room&#8208;temperature electrosynthesis under atmospheric pressure offers a novel, safe, and effective route to access SASs. Herein, the recent progress in ambient electrosynthesis toward SASs for electrocatalytic sustainable hydrogen generation and utilization, and future opportunities are discussed. A systematic summary is started on three kinds of ambient electrochemically synthetic routes for SASs, including electrochemical etching (ECE), direct electrodeposition (DED), and electrochemical leaching&#8211;redeposition (ELR), associated with advanced characterization techniques. Next, their electrocatalytic applications for hydrogen energy conversion including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, and oxygen reduction reaction are reviewed. Finally, a brief conclusion and remarks&#160;on future challenges regarding further development of ambient electrosynthesis of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective SASCs for many other electrocatalytic applications are presented.

         <title>A&#160;Wafer&#8208;Scale Nanoporous 2D Active Pixel Image Sensor Matrix with High Uniformity, High Sensitivity, and Rapid Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive and robust active&#8208;matrix image sensor circuitry is demonstrated by integrating a wafer&#8208;scale nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) phototransistor array with high&#8208;performance indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) switching transistors. A 4&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale 2D)MoS2 is synthesized and a periodic nanopore array is created on its surface to achieve exceptionally high photoresponsivity of 5.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. The device shows a technically advanced form based on large&#8208;area 2D material similar to a commercialized complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor consisting of a sensor and a driving transistor in the matrix pixel.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have&#160;been successfully developed as novel ubiquitous optoelectronics owing to their excellent electrical and optical characteristics. However, active&#8208;matrix image sensors based on TMDs have limitations owing to the difficulty of fabricating large&#8208;area integrated circuitry and achieving high optical sensitivity. Herein, a large&#8208;area uniform, highly sensitive, and robust image sensor matrix with active pixels consisting of nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) phototransistors and indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO) switching transistors is reported. Large&#8208;area uniform 4&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale bilayer MoS2 films are synthesized by radio&#8208;frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and sulfurization processes and patterned to be a nanoporous structure consisting of an array of periodic nanopores on the MoS2 surface via block copolymer lithography. Edge exposure on the nanoporous bilayer MoS2 induces the formation of subgap states, which promotes a photogating effect to obtain an exceptionally high photoresponsivity of 5.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. A 4&#8208;inch&#8208;wafer&#8208;scale image mapping is successively achieved using this active&#8208;matrix image sensor by controlling the device sensing and switching states. The high&#8208;performance active&#8208;matrix image sensor is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in 2D material&#8208;based integrated circuitry and pixel image sensor applications.

         <title>Tailoring the d&#8208;Orbital Splitting Manner of Single Atomic Sites for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe d&#8208;orbital splitting manner modulation strategy is proposed to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 sites. The axial tractions induce the transformation of local crystal field from primary square&#8208;planar field to the quasi&#8208;octahedral coordination. The rearrangement of electronic states leads to a favorable adsorption of ORR intermediates and excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Regulating the electronic states of single atomic sites around the Fermi level remains a major concern for boosting the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a Fe d&#8208;orbital splitting manner modulation strategy by constructing axial coordination on Fe&#63743;N4 sites is presented. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the axial tractions induce the distortion of square&#8208;planar field (Fe&#63743;N4 SP), up to the quasi&#8208;octahedral coordination (Fe&#63743;N4O1 OCquasi), thus leading to the electron rearrangement with a diluted spin polarization. The declined population of unpaired electrons in dz2, dxz and dyz states engenders a moderate adsorption of ORR intermediates, thereby reinforcing the intrinsic reaction activity. In situ infrared spectroscopy further demonstrates that the reordering of d&#8208;orbital splitting and occupation facilitates the desorption of *OH. The Fe&#63743;N4O1 OCquasi exhibits a dramatic improvement of kinetic current density and turnover frequency, which are fivefold and tenfold higher than those of Fe&#63743;N4 SP. This work presents a novel understanding on improving the electrocatalytic performance through the orbital&#8208;scale manipulation.

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Topological States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental realization of higher&#8208;order thermal topological states in a generalized 2D diffusion lattice&#160;is&#160;reported. The topological edge and corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate spectrum that isolated from the bulk. Topological protection of these thermal domain&#8208;wall states is demonstrated with the stability of their diffusion profiles in the presence of amorphous deformation.








Abstract
Unlike conventional topological materials that carry topological states at their boundaries, higher&#8208;order topological materials are able to support topological states at boundaries of boundaries, such as corners and hinges.

&lt;p&gt;Experimental realization of higher-order thermal topological states in a generalized 2D diffusion lattice&#160;is&#160;reported. The topological edge and corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate spectrum that isolated from the bulk.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional topological materials that carry topological states at their boundaries, higher-order topological materials are able to support topological states at boundaries of boundaries, such as corners and hinges. While band topology has been recently extended into thermal diffusion for thermal metamaterials, its realization is limited to a 1D thermal lattice, lacking access to the higher-order topology. In this work, the experimental realization is reported of a higher-order thermal topological insulator in a generalized 2D diffusion lattice. The topological corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate of the bulk, as a consequence of the anti-Hermitian nature of the diffusion Hamiltonian. The topological protection of these thermal corner states is demonstrated with the stability of their diffusion profile in the presence of amorphous deformation. This work constitutes the first realization of higher-order topology in purely diffusive systems and opens the door for future thermal management with topological protection beyond 1D geometries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlock Restricted Capacity via O&#63743;Ce Hybridization for Li&#63743;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>

Different from the reported surface&#8208;mediated Li2O2 with limited film thickness of t&#160;&lt; 50&#160;nm, a submicron&#8208;thick Li2O2 shell with t&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm can be grown onto a high&#8208;energy faceted CeO2&#8208;&#948; catalyst, which induces an orbital hybridized electronic structure via electrochemical activations, unlocking the rechargeable capacities of Li&#8208;O2 batteries from restricted 1000 to unprecedented 10&#8201;000 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
The aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) has the highest theoretical energy density of any rechargeable batteries. However, such system is largely restricted by the electrochemically formed lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the cathode surface, leading ultimately to low actual capacities and early cell death. In contrast to the surface&#8208;mediated growth of thin film with a thickness &lt;50&#160;nm, a non&#8208;crystalline Li2O2 film with a thickness of &gt;400&#160;nm can be formed via an optimal O&#63743;Ce hybridized electronic structure. Specially, oxygen can react with dissolved cerium cations in the electrolyte via a cerium&#8208;oxygen reaction to form a high&#8208;energy faceted cerium oxide catalyst, which not only generates a great number of non&#8208;saturable active sites, but also erects electron transport bridges between the lattice O and adjacent Ce atoms. Such Ce&#63743;O orbital hybridization&#160;also forms a direct charge transfer channel from Ce&#63743;&#8208;4f of CeO2 to O22&#8722;${\rm{O}}_2^{2 - }$&#8208;&#960;* of Li2O2, eventually leading to submicron&#8208;thick Li2O2 shells via a subsequent lithium&#8208;oxygen reaction. Relying on the above merits, this work unlocks the rechargeable capacities of LOB from restricted 1000 to unprecedented 10&#160;000&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with good cyclabilities and reduced charge&#8211;discharge overpotentials.

         <title>Density&#8208;of&#8208;States Matching&#8208;Induced Ultrahigh Current Density and High&#8208;Humidity Resistance in a Simply&#160;Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is developed by using conductive materials as the triboelectric layers and electrodes simultaneously. Because of the matched density of states, the TENG reaches an ultrahigh current density of 1333 mA&#160;m&#8722;2. More importantly, this device can work stably in high&#8208;humidity environments, which is always a big challenge for traditional TENGs.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can covert mechanical energy into electricity in a clean and sustainable manner. However, traditional TENGs are mainly limited by the low&#160;output current, and thus their practical applications are still limited. Herein, a new type of TENG is developed by using conductive materials as the triboelectric layers and electrodes simultaneously. Because of the matched density of states between the two triboelectric layers, this simply&#160;structured device reaches an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1400&#160;V and an ultrahigh current density of 1333&#160;mA m&#8722;2 when poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) film and copper (Cu) or aluminum (Al) foil are used as the triboelectric pair. The current density increases by nearly three orders of magnitude compared with traditional TENGs. More importantly, this device can work stably in high&#8208;humidity environments, which is always a big challenge for traditional TENGs. Surprisingly, this TENG can even perform well in the presence of water droplets. This work provides a new and effective strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance TENGs, which can be used in many practical applications in the near future.

         <title>Breaking the Photostability and pH Limitation of Halo&#8208;Fluoresceins through Chitosan Conjugation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are famous for various applications, such as photoredox synthesis, photodynamic therapy, and sensing and imaging, but suffer from notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence, which limit their applications in long&#8208;term light exposure and acidic environments. Herein, a chitosan conjugation strategy is proposed for significantly increasing the anti&#8208;photobleaching activity and pH inertness of halo&#8208;fluoresceins, endowing these old dyes&#160;with&#160;new&#160;vitality.&#160;








Abstract
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are widely used in cell and tissue staining, intracellular sensing, and photodynamic therapy, but their notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence restrict their applications, especially in long&#8208;term visible light exposure and acidic environments. To overcome these limitations, here a strategy is proposed of conjugating chitosan with the carboxyl group of halo&#8208;fluorescein (CS&#8208;halofluorescein). The cross&#8208;linked polymer chains and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of chitosan help shielding out 1O2 from direct attacking the encapsulated halo&#8208;fluoresceins, leading to a&#160;two orders of magnitude lower photobleaching rate. Meanwhile, the condensation of primary amines of chitosan with the carboxyl group on halo&#8208;fluorescein blocks the pH&#8208;dependent intramolecular spirocyclization, leading to pH&#8208;inert fluorescein derivatives. The greatly improved photostability and pH inertness of CS&#8208;halofluoresceins can be harvested for aerobic photoredox synthesis and photodynamic bacteria inactivation in extremely acidic media. Moreover, food additive nature of chitosan and erythrosine (TIF) and excellent film&#8208;forming property of chitosan allow coating&#8208;based light&#8208;assisted preservation of perishable fruits, leading to appreciably extended shelf life of fruits (e.g., perishable strawberry, rt: &gt; 3 days; 4&#160;&#176;C: &gt; 5 days).

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Rich Interface for a Highly Stable and Safe 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ generation of phosphate&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is proposed by reasonable design of the&#160;electrolyte, which can stabilize the LiCoO2&#160;(LCO) by decreasing the generation of cracks and suppressing the degradation of interface. Besides, it improves the flame&#8208;retardancy of electrolyte and guarantees the safety issues of high&#8208;voltage LCO.








Abstract
Increasing the upper cut&#8208;off voltage of LiCoO2 (LCO) is one of the most efficient strategies to gain high&#8208;energy density for current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, surface instability is expected to be exaggerated with increasing voltage arising from the high reactivity between the delithiated LCO and electrolytes, leading to serious safety concerns. This work is aimed to construct a physically and chemically stable phosphate&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface (CEI) on the LCO particles to mitigate this issue. This phosphate&#8208;rich CEI is generated during the electrochemical activation by using fluoroethylene carbonate and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyletherare as the solvents. Both solvents also demonstrate high thermal stability, reducing the intrinsic flammability of the commercial organic electrolyte, thereby eliminating the safety concern in the LCO&#8208;based systems upon high&#8208;voltage operation. This stable CEI layer on the particle surface can also enhance the surface structure by blocking direct contact between LCO and electrolyte, improving the cycling stability. Therefore, by using the proposed electrolyte, the LCO cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 76.1% after 200 cycles at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V.

     alt="Phosphate-Rich Interface for a Highly Stable and Safe 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in situ generation of phosphate-rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is proposed by reasonable design of the&#160;electrolyte, which can stabilize the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;(LCO) by decreasing the generation of cracks and suppressing the degradation of interface. Besides, it improves the flame-retardancy of electrolyte and guarantees the safety issues of high-voltage LCO.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the upper cut-off voltage of LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) is one of the most efficient strategies to gain high-energy density for current lithium-ion batteries. However, surface instability is expected to be exaggerated with increasing voltage arising from the high reactivity between the delithiated LCO and electrolytes, leading to serious safety concerns. This work is aimed to construct a physically and chemically stable phosphate-rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface (CEI) on the LCO particles to mitigate this issue. This phosphate-rich CEI is generated during the electrochemical activation by using fluoroethylene carbonate and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyletherare as the solvents. Both solvents also demonstrate high thermal stability, reducing the intrinsic flammability of the commercial organic electrolyte, thereby eliminating the safety concern in the LCO-based systems upon high-voltage operation. This stable CEI layer on the particle surface can also enhance the surface structure by blocking direct contact between LCO and electrolyte, improving the cycling stability. Therefore, by using the proposed electrolyte, the LCO cathode exhibits a high-capacity retention of 76.1% after 200 cycles at a high cut-off voltage of 4.6&#160;V. This work provides a novel insight into the rational design of high-voltage and safe battery systems by adopting the flame-retardant electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A new class of lightweight composite metamaterial concrete with unprecedented mechanical properties and energy harvesting and sensing functionalities is presented. The metamaterial concrete systems are composed of auxetic lattices embedded inside a conductive cement matrix. They are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility. The power output of the nanogenerator&#8208;integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#181;W.








Abstract
Creating multifunctional concrete materials with advanced functionalities and mechanical tunability is a critical step toward reimagining the traditional civil infrastructure systems. Here, the concept of nanogenerator&#8208;integrated mechanical metamaterial concrete is presented to design lightweight and mechanically tunable concrete systems with energy harvesting and sensing functionalities. The proposed metamaterial concrete systems are created via integrating the mechanical metamaterial and nano&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting paradigms. These advanced materials are composed of reinforcement auxetic polymer lattices with snap&#8208;through buckling behavior fully embedded inside a conductive cement matrix.&#160;We&#160;rationally design their composite structures to induce contact&#8208;electrification between the layers under mechanical excitations/triggering. The conductive cement enhanced with graphite powder serves as the electrode in the proposed systems, while providing the desired mechanical performance. Experimental studies are conducted to investigate the mechanical and electrical properties of the designed prototypes. The metamaterial concrete systems are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility under cycling loading. The power output of the nanogenerator&#8208;integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#181;W. Furthermore, the self&#8208;powered sensing functionality of the nanogenerator concrete systems for distributed health monitoring of large&#8208;scale concrete structures&#160;is&#160;demonstrated. The metamaterial concrete paradigm can possibly enable the&#160;design&#160;of smart civil infrastructure systems with a broad range of advanced functionalities.

         <title>Optimizing the Pd Sites in Pure Metallic Aerogels for Efficient Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>

A novel catalyst design strategy is demonstrated for the optimization of Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By diminishing the Pd&#63743;Pd coordination, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs are constructed in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel, which are further fine&#8208;tuned to achieve an excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production.








Decentralized electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive alternative to the industrial anthraquinone process, the application of which is hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts in acidic media. Herein, a novel catalyst design strategy is reported to optimize the Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By increasing the Hg content in the Pd&#8211;Hg aerogels, the Pd&#63743;Pd coordination is gradually diminished, resulting in isolated, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel. Further heterometal doping leads to a series of M&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogels with an unalterable geometric environment, allowing for sole investigation&#160;of&#160;the electronic effects. Combining theoretical and experimental analyses, a volcano relationship is obtained for the M&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogels, demonstrating an effective tunability of the electronic structure of the Pd active sites. The optimized Au&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogel exhibits an outstanding H2O2 selectivity of 92.8% as well as transferred electron numbers of &#8776;2.1 in the potential range of 0.0&#8211;0.4 VRHE. This work opens a door for designing metallic aerogel electrocatalysts for H2O2 production and highlights the importance of electronic effects in tuning electrocatalytic performances.

         <title>Composite Hydrogel for Spatiotemporal Lipid Intervention of Tumor Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;composite hydrogel delivers three&#8208;in&#8208;one lipid peroxidation (LPO)&#8208;inducing nanoparticles (NPs) to tumor cells for amplified immune stimuli, and carries lipid rewiring agent to immunosuppressive cells for enhanced immune perception, thereby spatiotemporally regulating the tumor milieu for improved therapeutic outcomes.








Abstract
Induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) plays crucial roles in cancer immunotherapy, whereas its efficacy is severely compromised by redundant antioxidant defenses in cancer cells and aberrant lipid metabolism in immunosuppressive cell populations. In&#160;this&#160;work, it is found that hollow mesoporous CuS nanoparticles (NPs) possess an intrinsic capacity of inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). When loaded with an inhibitor of the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), these NPs block two parallel redox systems and cooperate with near&#8208;infrared irradiation to reinforce ICD. A hydrogel co&#8208;delivering cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting CuS NPs and immunosuppressive&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting sulfo&#8208;N&#8208;succinimidyl oleate (SSO) for spatiotemporal lipid intervention i further fabricated. While the CuS NPs augment ICD via synergistic lipid peroxidation, SSO reinstates immune perception via lipid metabolic reprogramming, thereby coordinately triggering robust innate and adaptive immunity to restrain tumor growth, relapse, and metastasis.

&lt;p&gt;A&#160;composite hydrogel delivers three-in-one lipid peroxidation (LPO)-inducing nanoparticles (NPs) to tumor cells for amplified immune stimuli, and carries lipid rewiring agent to immunosuppressive cells for enhanced immune perception, thereby spatiotemporally regulating the tumor milieu for improved therapeutic outcomes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) plays crucial roles in cancer immunotherapy, whereas its efficacy is severely compromised by redundant antioxidant defenses in cancer cells and aberrant lipid metabolism in immunosuppressive cell populations. In&#160;this&#160;work, it is found that hollow mesoporous CuS nanoparticles (NPs) possess an intrinsic capacity of inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). When loaded with an inhibitor of the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), these NPs block two parallel redox systems and cooperate with near-infrared irradiation to reinforce ICD. A hydrogel co-delivering cancer-cell-targeting CuS NPs and immunosuppressive-cell-targeting sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) for spatiotemporal lipid intervention i further fabricated. While the CuS NPs augment ICD via synergistic lipid peroxidation, SSO reinstates immune perception via lipid metabolic reprogramming, thereby coordinately triggering robust innate and adaptive immunity to restrain tumor growth, relapse, and metastasis. This study provides an immunometabolic therapy via orchestrated lipid modulation in the tumor milieu.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precisely Controllable Artificial Muscle with Continuous Morphing based on &#8220;Breathing&#8221; of Supramolecular Columns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid&#160;crystal polymer forms multichain supramolecular columnar assemblies. Through the cooperative movements of main&#8208;chains and side&#8208;chains, the uniaxially aligned polymer strip executes muscle&#8208;like continuous and reversible elongation/contraction. The irreversible photoisomerization of mesogens further endows the polymer strip with arm&#8208;like phototunable bending which can lift heavy load. Both deformations are under precise control of temperature.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles are natural motors executing sophisticated work through precise control of linear contraction. Although various liquid crystal polymers&#160;based artificial muscles have&#160;been designed, the mechanism based on mainly the order&#8211;disorder transition usually leads to discrete shape morphing, leaving arbitrary and precise deformation a huge challenge. Here, one novel photoresponsive hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid crystal polymer with a unique &#8220;breathing&#8221; columnar phase that enables continuous morphing is presented. Due to confinement inside the supramolecular columnar assembly, the cooperative movements of side&#8208;chains and backbones generate a significant negative thermal expansion and lead to temperature&#8208;controllable muscle&#8208;like elongation/contraction in the oriented polymer strip. The irreversible isomerization of the photoresponsive mesogens results in the synergistic phototunable bending and high&#8208;contrast fluorescence change. Based on the orthogonal responses to heat and light, controllable arm&#8208;like bending motions of this material, which is applicable in constructing advanced artificial muscles or intelligent soft robotics, are further demonstrated.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Gas System for Promoted Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis on Porous Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional gas&#8208;in&#8208;solvent reaction systems for photocatalytic nitrogen reduction suffer from unsatisfactory activity, since the overwhelming protic solvent severely hinders the nitrogen transfer and causes strong competing hydrogen evolution. In this work, a novel &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;gas&#8221; system, which enables direct operation of photocatalyst under a nitrogen gas&#8208;dominated environment with limited proton source, is designed to fundamentally solve the above problem.








Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) is emerging as a sustainable ammonia synthesis approach to meet global carbon neutrality. Porous framework materials with well&#8208;designed structures have great opportunities in PNRR; however, they suffer from unsatisfactory activity in the conventional gas&#8208;in&#8208;solvent system (GIS), owing to the hindrance of nitrogen utilization and strong competing hydrogen evolution caused by overwhelming solvent. In this study, porous framework materials are combined with a novel &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;gas&#8221; system, which can bring their superiority into full play. This system enables photocatalysts to directly operate in a gas&#8208;dominated environment with a limited proton source uniformly suspended in it, achieving the accumulation of high&#8208;concentrated nitrogen within porous framework while efficiently restricting the solvent&#8208;photocatalyst contact. An over eightfold increase in ammonia production rate (1820.7 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) compared with the conventional GIS and an apparent quantum efficiency as high as &#8776;0.5% at 400 nm are achieved. This system&#8208;level strategy further finds applicability in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring it as a staple for photosynthetic methodology.

         <title>Engineering Human Brain Assembloids by Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microfluidic system is presented for the spatially controlled patterning of human&#8208;brain region&#8208;specific organoids, allowing for the efficient, scalable, and flexible generation of brain assembloids. Therefore, this microfluidic system has remarkable potential in wide applications of assembloid technology in neurological and biomedical fields.








Abstract
Brain assembloids offer a highly promising strategy to model human brain development and disease, and advance potential studies in regenerative medicine, therapeutic screening, and drug discovery, while it is challenging to produce uniform brain organoids and assemble them flexibly by conventional methods. Here, a multidisciplinary engineered strategy to generate human brain assembloids with desired patterning based on microfluidic technology&#160;is presented. By encapsulating human induced pluripotent stem cells in microcapsules via microfluidic electrospray, brain region&#8208;specific organoids are efficiently formed, which are then introduced into a microfluidic chip consisting of a bottom layer with a micropillar array and a movable upper layer with a complementary microhole array. These brain organoids can settle into microholes and fuse into brain assembloids. As varied organoid microcapsules with designed 1D sequences or 2D arrays can be assembled into the vertical microholes, large coding amounts of fused brain assembloids with desired patterning can be produced. It is found that brain assembloids composed of cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic organoids can grow and function well, characterized with active neural migration and interaction. These features indicate that the suggested flexible, scalable, and controlled microfluidic systems are remarkably potential in wide applications of brain assembloids in neurological and biomedical fields.

         <title>The Atomic Drill Bit: Precision Controlled Atomic Fabrication of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through direct and automated control over the electron beam scan pathway profile in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, metallic 1D&#8211;2D edge heterostructures are fabricated with atomic precision in semiconducting MoS2. This atomic fabrication workflow paves the way for precision controlled atomic fabrication of functional nanomaterials.








Abstract
The ability to deterministically fabricate nanoscale architectures with atomic precision is the central goal of nanotechnology, whereby highly localized changes in the atomic structure can be exploited to control device properties at their fundamental physical limit. Here, an automated, feedback&#8208;controlled atomic fabrication method is reported and the formation of 1D&#8211;2D heterostructures in MoS2 is demonstrated through selective transformations along specific crystallographic orientations. The atomic&#8208;scale probe of an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is used, and the shape and symmetry of the scan pathway relative to the sample orientation are controlled. The focused and shaped electron beam is used to reliably create Mo6S6 nanowire (MoS&#8208;NW) terminated metallic&#8208;semiconductor 1D&#8211;2D edge structures within a pristine MoS2 monolayer with atomic precision. From these results, it is found that a triangular beam path aligned along the zig&#8208;zag sulfur terminated (ZZS)&#160;direction forms stable MoS&#8208;NW edge structures with the highest degree of fidelity without resulting in disordering of the surrounding MoS2 monolayer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) are used to calculate the energetic barriers for the most stable atomic edge structures and atomic transformation pathways. These discoveries provide an automated method to improve understanding of atomic&#8208;scale transformations while opening a pathway toward more precise atomic&#8208;scale engineering of materials.

         <title>Vanadium Oxide&#8208;Doped Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Multi&#8208;Parameter Sensor to Decouple Soil Nitrogen Loss and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly porous 3D vanadium oxide&#8208;doped laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide&#8208;doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self&#8208;assembled films. The resulting foam composite provides a high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;parameter sensor to completely decouple nitrogen oxides and temperature, allowing for accurate detection of nitrogen loss and soil temperature for precision agriculture.








Abstract
Monitoring nitrogen utilization efficiency and soil temperature in agricultural systems for timely intervention is essential for crop health&#160;with reduced environmental pollution. Herein, this work presents a high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;parameter sensor based on vanadium oxide (VOX)&#8208;doped laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) foam to completely decouple nitrogen oxides (NOX) and temperature. The highly porous 3D VOX&#8208;doped LIG foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide (V5S8)&#8208;doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self&#8208;assembled films. The heterojunction formed at the LIG/VOX interface provides the sensor with enhanced response to NOX and an ultralow limit of detection of 3 ppb (theoretical estimate of 451 ppt) at room temperature. The sensor also exhibits a wide detection range, fast response/recovery, good selectivity, and stability over 16 days. Meanwhile, the sensor can accurately detect temperature over a wide linear range of 10&#8211;110&#160;&#176;C. The encapsulation of the sensor with a soft membrane further allows for temperature sensing without being affected by NOX. The unencapsulated sensor operated at elevated temperature removes the influences of relative humidity and temperature variations for accurate NOX measurements. The capability to decouple nitrogen loss and soil temperature&#160;paves the way for the development of future multimodal decoupled electronics for precision agriculture and health monitoring.

         <title>High Durability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Carbon Vacancies toward the&#160;Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy&#8208;modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are successfully prepared through microenvironment modulation and applied as highly durable catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and zinc&#8211;air batteries. The vacancies around metal&#8211;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics and stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive interest to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, the development of SACs with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability is a great challenge. In this work, carbon vacancy modified Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs (FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C) are practically designed and synthesized through microenvironment modulation, achieving high&#8208;efficient utilization of active sites and optimization of electronic structures. The FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91&#160;V and sufficient durability of 100&#8201;000 voltage cycles with 29&#160;mV E1/2 loss. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the vacancies around metal&#8211;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the ORR kinetics and stability. Accordingly, FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs presented a high&#8208;power density and long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#160;h in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). This work will not only guide for developing highly active and stable SACs through rational modulation of metal&#8211;N4 sites, but also provide an insight into the optimization of the electronic structure to boost electrocatalytical performances.

         <title>Sunlight Stimulated Photochemical Self&#8208;Healing Polymers Capable of Re&#8208;Bonding Damages up to a Centimeter Below the Surface Even Out of the Reach of the Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing polymers capable of remending cracks up to a centimeter deep based on long&#8208;range free radicals transfer mechanism are developed by the incorporation of photo&#8208;sensitive dithiocarbamate units. Furthermore, record&#8208;high mechanical properties are acquired as compared with the reported photo&#8208;reversible polymers.









The development of photochemical self&#8208;healing polymers faces the the following bottlenecks: i) only the surface cracks can be restored and ii) materials&#8217; mechanical properties are lower. To break these bottlenecks, cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;dithiocarbamate)s carrying photo&#8208;reversible dithiocarbamate bonds covalently linked to indole chromophores and benzyl groups are designed. The conjugated structure of the chromophore and benzyl enhances the addition reactivity of thiocarbonyl moiety and facilitates photo&#8208;cleavage of C&#63743;S bond, so that transfer of the created radicals among dithiocarbamate linkages is promoted. Accordingly, reshuffling of the reversibly cross&#8208;linked networks via dynamic exchange between the activated dithiocarbamates is enabled in both surface layer and the interior upon exposure to the low&#8208;intensity ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun. It is found that the damages up to a centimeter below the surface can be effectively recovered in the sunshine, which greatly exceeds the maximum penetration distance of UV light (hundreds of microns). Besides, tensile strength and failure strain of the poly(urethane&#8208;dithiocarbamate) are superior to the reported photo&#8208;reversible polymers, achieving the record&#8208;high 33.8 MPa and 782.0% owing to the wide selectivity of soft/hard blocks, multiple interactions, and appropriate cross&#8208;linking architecture. The present work provides a novel paradigm of photo self&#8208;healing polymers capable of re&#8208;bonding cracks even out of the reach of the illumination.

         <title>FeNC Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalyst with High Utilization Penta&#8208;Coordinated Sites</title>

         <dc:description>
An iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon oxygen reduction electrocatalyst with penta&#8208;coordinated sites and high electrochemical active sites utilization is prepared by low&#8208;temperature Fe coordination in a porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon synthetized through the ionothermal pyrolysis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaminopyrimidine. The structure of the active site is studied by means of X&#8208;ray absorption and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and the effect of axial ligands through density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
Atomic Fe in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeNC) electrocatalysts for oxygen (O2) reduction at the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells are the most promising alternative to platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal catalysts. Despite recent progress on atomic FeNC O2&#160;reduction, their controlled synthesis and stability for practical applications remain challenging. A two&#8208;step synthesis approach has recently led to significant advances in terms of Fe&#8208;loading and mass activity; however, the Fe utilization remains low owing to the difficulty of building scaffolds with sufficient porosity that electrochemically exposes the active sites. Herein, this issue is addressed by coordinating Fe in a highly porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (&#8776;3295&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), prepared by pyrolysis of inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;triaminopyrimidine and a Mg2+ salt active site template and porogen. Upon Fe coordination, a high electrochemical active site density of 2.54&#160;&#215;&#160;1019&#160;sites&#160;gFeNC&#8722;1&#160;and a record 52% FeNx electrochemical utilization based on in situ nitrite stripping are achieved. The Fe single atoms are characterized pre&#8208; and post&#8208;electrochemical accelerated stress testing by aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, showing no Fe clustering. Moreover, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and low&#8208;temperature M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy suggest the presence of penta&#8208;coordinated Fe sites, which are further studied by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Homogeneous Chemical Distribution in Functional Polyradical Microspheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using analytical electron microscopy techniques, it is demonstrated that the postfunctionalization of solid polymeric microstructures can&#8212;unexpectedly&#8212;lead to polyradical functionalization throughout the entirety of the material.








Abstract
It is demonstrated that the postfunctionalization of solid polymeric microspheres can generate fully and throughout functionalized materials, contrary to the expectation that core&#8211;shell structures are generated. The full functionalization is illustrated on the example of photochemically generated microspheres, which are subsequently transformed into polyradical systems. Given the all&#8208;organic nature of the functionalized microspheres, characterization methods with high analytical sensitivity and spatial resolution are pioneered by directly visualizing the inner chemical distribution of the postfunctionalized microspheres based on characteristic electron energy loss signals in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specifically, ultrasonic ultramicrotomy is combined successfully with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and electron spectroscopic&#160;imaging (ESI) during TEM. These findings open a key avenue for analyzing all&#8208;organic low&#8208;contrast soft&#8208;matter material structures, while the specifically investigated system concomitantly holds promise as an all&#8208;radical solid&#8208;state functional material.

         <title>Stabilizing Single&#8208;Atomic Pt by Forming Pt&#63743;Fe Bonds for Efficient Diboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Pt catalyst with Fe&#8211;Pt&#8211;O structure is constructed to tune the oxidation state of Pt for high catalytic efficiency of the diboration of alkynes. Benefiting from the well&#8208;tuned structure, the catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance at high temperature. Strikingly, the reaction can be catalyzed at room temperature with a relatively high turnover frequency.








Abstract
Precisely tailoring the oxidation state of single&#8208;atomic metal in heterogeneous catalysis is an efficient way to stabilize the single&#8208;atomic site and promote their activity, but realizing this approach remains a grand challenge to date. Herein, a class of stable single&#8208;atomic catalysts with well&#8208;tuned oxidation state of Pt by forming Pt&#63743;Fe atomic bonds&#160;is&#160;reported, which are supported by defective Fe2O3&#160;nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (PFARFNs). These as&#8208;synthesized materials can greatly enhance the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity for the diboration of alkynes. The PFARFNs exhibit high conversion of 99% at 100&#160;&#176;C with an outstanding turnover frequency (TOF) of 545&#160;h&#8722;1, and a relatively high conversion of 58% at room temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) with a TOF of 310&#160;h&#8722;1, which has been&#160;hardly achieved previously. Through both experimental and theoretical investigation, it is demonstrated that the fast electron transfer from Fe to Pt in Fe&#8211;Pt&#8211;O atomic sites in PFARFNs can not only stabilize the single&#8208;atomic Pt, but also significantly improve their catalytic activity.

Melt Electrowriting
In article number 2209244, Carlos S&#225;nchez&#8208;Somolinos and co&#8208;workers report on the melt electrowriting of liquid crystal elastomers to digitally position ultrafine fibers with controlled morphology. The presented methodology enables the preparation of well&#8208;defined, high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio scaffolds with small dimensions hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques. This printing platform enables the preparation of stimuli&#8208;responsive miniaturized structures for biomedical and soft robotic applications.

Acoustic Metasurfaces
In article number 2208002, Mingxin Xu, Peter V. S. Lee, David J. Collins, and co&#8208;workers present an approach to ultrathin acoustic metasurfaces, using planarized micropillars in a discretized phase array, which can be easily produced by a single&#8208;step etching process. The flexibility of this approach is demonstrated in the production of complex acoustic patterns using acoustic holography.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Hybridized Hydroxides for Energy Conversion and Storage: Interface Chemistry and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have unique superiorities in energy storage/conversion, in which the intrinsic roles of carbon at the heterogeneous interface are highlighted. The methods to construct a robust heterointerface in CHHs are summarized. The techniques to pinpoint the interface interaction and rehybridization electron configuration between carbon and hydroxides, and the future directions and perspective of the CHHs are outlined.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have been intensively investigated for uses in the energy conversion/storage fields. Nevertheless, the intrinsic structure&#8211;activity relationships between carbon and hydroxides within CHHs are still blurry, which hinders the fine modulation of CHHs in terms of practical applications to some degree. This review aims to figure out the intrinsic role of carbon materials in CHHs with a focus on the interface chemistry and the engineering strategy in&#8208;between two components. The fundamental effects of the carbon materials in enhancing the charge/mass transfer kinetics are first analyzed, particularly the extra electron pathways for fast charge transfer and the anchoring sites for boosting the mass transfer. Subsequently, the surface&#8208;guided/confined effects of carbon materials in CHHs to modify the morphology and tailor the hydroxides, and functional heterojunction for regulating the inner electronic structure are decoupled. The methods to efficiently construct a stable yet robust solid&#8211;solid heterointerface are summarized, including oxygen functional groups engrafting, topological defective sites construction and heteroatom incorporation to activate the inert carbon surface. The smart CHHs in some typical energy applications are demonstrated. Additionally, the methodologies that can reveal the hybridization electron configuration between two components are summed up. At last, the perspective and challenges faced by the CHHs for energy&#8208;related applications are outlined.

         <title>Recent Advances in Efficient Photocatalysis via Modulation of Electric and Magnetic Fields and Reactive Phase Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation and reactive phase control strategies exhibit robust manipulation role in promoting the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, lowering photocatalytic reaction energy barrier, and facilitating mass transfer, which have received much attention and become the research hotspot in photocatalytic field for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The past several years has witnessed significant progress in enhancing photocatalytic performance via robust electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation to promote the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, and phase control at reactive interface to lower photocatalytic reaction energy barrier and facilitate mass transfer. These three research directions have received soaring attention in photocatalytic field. Herein, recent advances in photocatalysis modulated by electric field (i.e., piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and triboelectric fields, as well as their coupling) with specific examples and mechanisms discussion are first examined. Subsequently, the strategy via magnetic field manipulation for enhancing photocatalytic performance is scrutinized, including the spin polarization, Lorentz force, and magnetoresistance effect. Afterward, materials with tailored structure and composition design enabled by reactive phase control and their applications in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities to further boost photocatalytic efficiency are presented, aiming at providing crucial theoretical and experimental guidance for those working in photocatalysis, ferroelectrics, triboelectrics, piezo&#8208;/pyro&#8208;/tribo&#8208;phototronics, and electromagnetics, among other related areas.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics in various fields are reviewed. More importantly, the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels are discussed. Last, perspectives on the current challenges and future directions in the development of hydrogel&#8208;based multifunctional flexible electronics are provided.








Abstract
Flexible electronics is an emerging field of research involving multiple disciplines, which include but not limited to physics, chemistry, materials science, electronic engineering, and biology. However, the broad applications of flexible electronics are still restricted due to several limitations, including high Young's modulus, poor biocompatibility, and poor responsiveness. Innovative materials aiming for overcoming these drawbacks and boost its practical application is highly desirable. Hydrogel is a class of 3D crosslinked hydrated polymer networks, and its exceptional material properties render it as a promising candidate for the next generation of flexible electronics. Here, the latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics in various fields are reviewed. More importantly, the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance is discussed here, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels. Last, perspectives on the current challenges and future directions in the development of hydrogel&#8208;based multifunctional flexible electronics are provided.
