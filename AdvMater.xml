         <title>Ferroelastic&#8211;Ferroelectric Multiferroicity in van der Waals Rhenium Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroic materials can switch orientations of crystal structure and polarization with external strain. 2D ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroicity in single&#8208;crystalline rhenium dichalcogenides is discovered. Reorientation of the physical properties based on reversible bond switching between the rhenium atoms provides insights for 2D multiferroic phase transitions and opens up new opportunities for applications such as multilevel memory.








Abstract
2D multiferroics with combined ferroic orders have gained attention owing to their novel functionality and underlying science. Intrinsic ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroicity in single&#8208;crystalline van der Waals rhenium dichalcogenides, whose symmetries are broken by the Peierls distortion and layer&#8208;stacking order, is demonstrated. Ferroelastic switching of the domain orientation and accompanying anisotropic properties is achieved with 1% uniaxial strain using the polymer encapsulation method. Based on the electron localization function and bond dissociation energy of the Re&#8211;Re bonds, the change in bond configuration during the evolution of the domain wall and the preferred switching between the two specific orientation states are explained. Furthermore, the ferroelastic switching of ferroelectric polarization is confirmed using the photovoltaic effect. The study provides insights into the reversible bond&#8208;switching process and potential applications based on 2D multiferroicity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Electrolysis for Co&#8208;Production of Phosphate and Hydrogen in Neutral Phosphate Buffer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2 gas, NaZnPO4, and electric energy can be generated concurrently by a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES), which is driven by the spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O in a neutral PBS solution. The SCES uses a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In the SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. A high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst is synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential.








Abstract
The spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O is of critical importance and could plausibly be used to produce H2 gas, especially under neutral conditions. However, this reaction has long been overlooked owing to its sluggish kinetics and Zn consumption. Herein, a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES) is reported, which uses a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In this SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. Additionally, the composition and phase structure of NaZnPO4 can be well regulated. In this study, a high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst is synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential of 64.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. H2 gas (13.7 mL cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and NaZnPO4 (3.73 mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) are obtained at the cathode and anode, respectively, in the N,Cu&#8208;CoP/CC||Zn SCES spontaneously. Moreover, the SCES has a favorable open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.79 V and a maximum power density of 1.83 mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to elucidate the electronic structure and HER catalytic mechanism of the N and Cu co&#8208;doped CoP catalysts.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Embedded with Zincophilic Cu Nanoboxes for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D framework consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (Cu NBs@NCFs) is constructed as a multifunctional host for dendrite&#8208;free and stable Zn anodes. Benefiting from the macroporous network, hollow structures, and rich zincophilic sites, the Cu NBs@NCFs host shows low voltage hysteresis, high Coulombic efficiency, and impressive cycling stability in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The practical application of Zn&#8208;metal anodes (ZMAs) is mainly impeded by the limited lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) resulting from the Zn dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a 3D multifunctional host consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (denoted as Cu NBs@NCFs) is rationally designed and developed for stable ZMAs. The 3D macroporous configuration and hollow structure can lower the local current density and alleviate the large volume change during the repeated cycling processes. Furthermore, zincophilic Cu and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Cu&#8211;Zn alloy can act as homogeneous nucleation sites to minimize the Zn nucleation overpotential, further guiding uniform and dense Zn deposition. As a result, this Cu NBs@NCFs host exhibits high CE of Zn plating/stripping for 1000 cycles. The Cu NBs@NCFs&#8211;Zn electrode shows low voltage hysteresis and prolonged cycling life (450 h) with dendrite&#8208;free behaviors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a Zn&#8208;ion full cell is fabricated based on this Cu NBs@NCFs&#8211;Zn anode, which demonstrates decent rate capability and improved cycling performance.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Antibacterial Strategies Enabled by Gene&#8208;Transfection and Immunomodulatory Nanoparticles in 3D&#8208;Printed Scaffolds for Synergistic Exogenous and Endogenous Treatment of Infections</title>

LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37 nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a 3D&#8208;printed scaffold address the challenges associated with implant&#8208;related infections. The LL37 peptides grafted on NP surfaces effectively kill recalcitrant pathogens. Intracellular LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37 NPs then release loaded LL37 plasmids, providing a constant supply of LL37. The NPs also alleviate immunosuppression at sites of infection, thus restoring the normal anti&#8208;infection function of the immune system.








Abstract
As research on refractory Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related implant infection intensifies, certain challenges remain, including low antibiotic concentrations within infected areas, immune escape achieved by intracellular bacteria, myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inducing regional immunosuppression, and recurrence of residual pathogenic bacteria after drug suspension. Herein, a novel antimicrobial system to simultaneously address these issues is proposed. Specifically, an oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed scaffold with shell&#8211;core nanoparticles is designed, which are loaded with an antimicrobial peptide plasmid (LL37 plasmid) and have LL37 grafted on their surface (LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37). The surface&#8208;grafted LL37 directly kills S. aureus and, following entry into cells, the nanoparticles kill intracellular bacteria. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo, following translation of the LL37 plasmid, cells function as factories of the antimicrobial peptide, thereby generating a continuous, prolonged antibacterial effect at the site of infection. This system significantly reduces the abnormal increase in MDSCs within the infected microenvironment, thus relieving the immunosuppressive state and restoring a protective antimicrobial immune response. Hence, this proposed antimicrobial system provides an antimicrobial immune response and a novel strategy for S. aureus&#8208;related infections by offering a combined active antimicrobial and immunotherapeutic strategy, thereby significantly reducing the recurrence rate following recovery from implant&#8208;associated infections.

         <title>Magnetoelectric Effect in Hydrogen Harvesting: Magnetic Field as a Trigger of Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is initiated by exploiting the magnetoelectric nature of CoFe2O4&#8211;BiFeO3 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles purely with alternating magnetic fields. As a direct trigger for the HER, magnetic fields can open cooperative pathways for maximizing hydrogen production by synergetic combinations with other energy sources such as electric fields and light.








Abstract
Magnetic fields have been regarded as an additional stimulus for electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, but not as a direct trigger for catalytic processes. Multiferroic/magnetoelectric materials, whose electrical polarization and surface charges can be magnetically altered, are especially suitable for triggering and control of catalytic reactions solely with magnetic fields. Here, it is demonstrated that magnetic fields can be employed as an independent input energy source for hydrogen harvesting by means of the magnetoelectric effect. Composite multiferroic CoFe2O4&#8211;BiFeO3 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles act as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is triggered when an alternating magnetic field is applied to an aqueous dispersion of the magnetoelectric nanocatalysts. Based on density functional calculations, it is proposed that the hydrogen evolution is driven by changes in the ferroelectric polarization direction of BiFeO3 caused by the magnetoelectric coupling. It is believed that the findings will open new avenues toward magnetically induced renewable energy harvesting.

         <title>Upcycling Silicon Photovoltaic Waste into Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon from waste photovoltaics is recycled into thermoelectrics in this work. The majority&#8208;carrier nature of thermoelectrics (defect and impurity insensitive) is highlighted as the perfect destination for recycling minority&#8208;carrier devices (such as photovoltaics). This work closes the loop for sustainability in green energy production.








Abstract
Two decades after the rapid expansion of photovoltaics, the number of solar panels reaching end&#8208;of&#8208;life is increasing. While precious metals such as silver and copper are usually recycled, silicon, which makes up the bulk of a solar cells, goes to landfills. This is due to the defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;sensitive nature in most silicon&#8208;based technologies, rendering it uneconomical to purify waste silicon. Thermoelectrics represents a rare class of material in which defects and impurities can be engineered to enhance the performance. This is because of the majority&#8208;carrier nature, making it defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;tolerant. Here, the upcycling of silicon from photovoltaic (PV) waste into thermoelectrics is enabled. This is done by doping 1% Ge and 4% P, which results in a figure of merit (zT) of 0.45 at 873&#160;K, the highest among silicon&#8208;based thermoelectrics. The work represents an important piece of the puzzle in realizing a circular economy for photovoltaics and electronic waste.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Ended Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 Heterostructures Nanocage Anode with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 heterostructures with an open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are accurately designed and synthesized by a selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration method, which displays excellent electrochemical performance as the anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sulfides are perceived as promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and structural diversity. Nonetheless, the poor structural stability and sluggish kinetics of sulfides lead to unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 heterostructures with an open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are well designed as the anode for PIBs via a selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration approach. The hollow Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO nanocages, with large surface area, abundant heterointerfaces, and unique open&#8208;ended nanocage structure, can reduce the K+ diffusion length and promote reaction kinetics. When used as the anode for PIBs, the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO exhibits high reversible capacity and low capacity degradation (0.0089% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1). A potassium&#8208;ion full battery with a Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO anode and Prussian blue cathode can display a superior reversible capacity of 400&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 after 300 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1. The unique structural advantages and electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO are revealed by finite&#8208;element&#8208;simulation in situ characterizations. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic sulfide anodes for advanced PIBs may provide vital guidance to design high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Creating Composite Vortex Beams with a Single Geometric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact metasurface approach is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to create composite vortex beams. A single geometric metasurface is used to realize the superposition of multiple vortex beams with different circular polarization states. This method provides a compact platform to generate composite vortex beams with engineered singularity distributions, which are fundamentally important for singular optics and quantum science.








Abstract
Composite vortex beams (CVBs) have attracted considerable interest recently due to the unique optical properties and potential applications. However, these beams are mainly generated using spatial light modulators, which suffer from large volume, high cost, and limited resolution. Benefiting from the ultrathin nature and unprecedented capability in light manipulation, optical metasurfaces provide a compact platform to perform this task. A metasurface approach to creating these CVBs is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The design is based on the superposition of multiple circularly polarized vortex beams with different topological charges, which is realized based on a geometric metasurface consisting of metallic nanorods with spatially variant orientations. The effects of the initial phases, amplitude coefficients, incident polarization state, and propagation distance on the generated CVBs, which are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, are experimentally analyzed. This work has opened a new avenue for engineering CVBs with a minimal footprint, which has promising applications ranging from multiple optical traps to quantum science.

         <dc:description>
The basic concepts of quantum computing, communications, and sensing technologies are introduced.

Theoretical and experimental studies on nanomaterials for quantum devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Quantum information science and engineering (QISE)&#8212;which entails the use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing&#8212;and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid&#8208;state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. This review considers how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. The materials challenges for specific types of qubits, along with how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges, are identified. Challenges for and progress toward nanomaterials&#8208;based quantum devices are condidered. The overall aim of the review is to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next&#8208;generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

&lt;p&gt;Quantum information science and engineering (QISE)&#8212;which entails the use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing&#8212;and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid-state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. This review considers how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. The materials challenges for specific types of qubits, along with how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges, are identified. Challenges for and progress toward nanomaterials-based quantum devices are condidered. The overall aim of the review is to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next-generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging 4D Printing Strategies for Next&#8208;Generation Tissue Regeneration and Medical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4D printing is becoming a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research field that holds considerable promise for diverse applications. This article introduces fabrication technologies and transforming strategies in terms of structural design and material composition design. The various 4D inks, actuation mechanisms, and recent advances in tissue regeneration and medical devices are summarized. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives are presented.








Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing has led to considerable progress in the field of biomedical engineering. Notably, 4D printing provides a potential strategy to achieve a time&#8208;dependent physical change within tissue scaffolds or replicate the dynamic biological behaviors of native tissues for smart tissue regeneration and the fabrication of medical devices. The fabricated stimulus&#8208;responsive structures can offer dynamic, reprogrammable deformation or actuation to mimic complex physical, biochemical, and mechanical processes of native tissues. Although there is notable progress made in the development of the 4D printing approach for various biomedical applications, its more broad&#8208;scale adoption for clinical use and tissue engineering purposes is complicated by a notable limitation of printable smart materials and the simplistic nature of achievable responses possible with current sources of stimulation. In this review, the recent progress made in the field of 4D printing by discussing the various printing mechanisms that are achieved with great emphasis on smart ink mechanisms of 4D actuation, construct structural design, and printing technologies, is highlighted. Recent 4D&#160;printing studies which focus on the applications of tissue/organ regeneration and medical devices are then summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of 4D printing are also discussed.

         <title>MXenes for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in employing MXenes in energy harvesting applications is summarized. Different energy sources, including solar, ultrasound, electrokinetic, salinity&#8208;gradient, piezoelectric, triboelectric, thermoelectric, and humidity energy, are discussed separately. The future challenges and promising directions of MXene research for energy harvesting are presented.








Abstract
Energy harvesting modules play an increasingly important role in the development of autonomous self&#8208;powered microelectronic devices. MXenes (i.e., 2D transition metal carbide/nitride) have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy applications due to their excellent electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and tunable properties. Herein, a perspective on using MXenes to harvest energy from various sources in the environment is presented. First, the characteristics of MXenes that facilitate energy capturing are systematically introduced and the preparation strategies of MXenes and their derived nanostructures tailored toward such applications are summarized. Subsequently, the harvesting mechanism of different energy sources (e.g., solar energy, thermoelectric energy, triboelectric energy, piezoelectric energy, salinity&#8208;gradient energy, electrokinetic energy, ultrasound energy, and humidity energy) are discussed. Then, the recent progress of MXene&#8208;based nanostructures in energy harvesting, as well as their applications, is introduced. Finally, opinions on the existing challenges and future directions of MXene&#8208;based nanostructure for energy harvesting are presented.

         <title>A Fully Solution&#8208;Printed Photosynaptic Transistor Array with Ultralow Energy Consumption for Artificial&#8208;Vision Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully solution&#8208;printed photosynaptic organic field&#8208;effect transistor is developed by introducing a source Schottky barrier. Both working voltage and current are substantially lowered, giving rise to an ultralow energy consumptions of 0.07&#8211;34 fJ per spike in short&#8208;term plasticity and 0.41&#8211;19.87 fJ per spike in long&#8208;term plasticity, which are comparable with biological synapses.








Abstract
Photosynaptic organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) represent a viable pathway to develop bionic optoelectronics. However, the high operating voltage and current of traditional photosynaptic OFETs lead to huge energy consumption greater than that of the real biological synapses, hindering their further development in new&#8208;generation visual prosthetics and artificial perception systems. Here, a fully solution&#8208;printed photosynaptic OFET (FSP&#8208;OFET) with substantial energy consumption reduction is reported, where a source Schottky barrier is introduced to regulate charge&#8208;carrier injection, and which operates with a fundamentally different mechanism from traditional devices. The FSP&#8208;OFET not only significantly lowers the working voltage and current but also provides extraordinary neuromorphic light&#8208;perception capabilities. Consequently, the FSP&#8208;OFET successfully emulates visual nervous responses to external light stimuli with ultralow energy consumption of 0.07&#8211;34 fJ per spike in short&#8208;term plasticity and 0.41&#8211;19.87 fJ per spike in long&#8208;term plasticity, both approaching the energy efficiency of biological synapses (1&#8211;100 fJ). Moreover, an artificial optic&#8208;neural network made from an 8 &#215; 8 FSP&#8208;OFET array on a flexible substrate shows excellent image recognition and reinforcement abilities at a low energy cost. The designed FSP&#8208;OFET offers an opportunity to realize photonic neuromorphic functionality with extremely low energy consumption dissipation.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Defective and Porous Ir Metallene with Polyallylamine for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyallylamine&#8208;wrapped Ir metallene with a defective and porous structure is fabricated by a one&#8208;step wet chemical reduction method. The abundance of defects and pores and the surface functionalization of the Ir metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity, efficient mass transport/diffusion, and tunable electronic structure, resulting in excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performance.








Abstract
The design of defects and porous structures into metallene with functional surfaces is highly desired to improve its permeability, surface area, and active sites, but remains a great challenge. In this work, polyallylamine&#8208;encapsulated Ir metallene with defects and porous structure (Ir@PAH metallene) is easily fabricated by a one&#8208;step wet chemical reduction method. The Ir@PAH metallene exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of only 14&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, a low Tafel slope of 31.2&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, and almost no activity decay after stability test. The abundant defects and pores as well as several&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer nanosheet structures of Ir@PAH metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and efficient mass transport/diffusion. In addition, surface&#8208;functionalized PAH molecules can modulate the electronic structure through strong Ir&#8211;N interaction and act as proton carriers to capture hydrogen ions, which is very beneficial for the HER in acidic media. This work provides a useful strategy for the synthesis of the defective and porous metallene with functionalized surfaces for various catalytic applications.

         <title>Quantifying Efficiency Limitations in All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells is reviewed by performing a detailed meta&#8208;analysis of key performance parameters. Using a consistent way of determining the bandgap, a unified approach is adopted for analyzing performance losses in perovskite solar cells based on breaking down the losses into several figures of merit representing recombination losses, resistive losses, and optical losses.








Abstract
While halide perovskites have excellent optoelectronic properties, their poor stability is a major obstacle toward commercialization. There is a strong interest to move away from organic A&#8208;site cations such as methylammonium and formamidinium toward Cs with the aim of improving thermal stability of the perovskite layers. While the optoelectronic properties and the device performance of Cs&#8208;based all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskites are very good, they are still trailing behind those of perovskites that use organic cations. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of all&#8208;inorganic perovskites for photovoltaic applications is reviewed by performing detailed meta&#8208;analyses of key performance parameters on the cell and material level. Key material properties such as carrier mobilities, external photoluminescence quantum efficiency, and photoluminescence lifetime are discussed and what is known about defect tolerance in all&#8208;inorganic is compared relative to hybrid (organic&#8211;inorganic) perovskites. Subsequently, a unified approach is adopted for analyzing performance losses in perovskite solar cells based on breaking down the losses into several figures of merit representing recombination losses, resistive losses, and optical losses. Based on this detailed loss analysis, guidelines are eventually developed for future performance improvement of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells.

     alt="Quantifying Efficiency Limitations in All-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-of-the-art of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells is reviewed by performing a detailed meta-analysis of key performance parameters. Using a consistent way of determining the bandgap, a unified approach is adopted for analyzing performance losses in perovskite solar cells based on breaking down the losses into several figures of merit representing recombination losses, resistive losses, and optical losses.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While halide perovskites have excellent optoelectronic properties, their poor stability is a major obstacle toward commercialization. There is a strong interest to move away from organic A-site cations such as methylammonium and formamidinium toward Cs with the aim of improving thermal stability of the perovskite layers. While the optoelectronic properties and the device performance of Cs-based all-inorganic lead-halide perovskites are very good, they are still trailing behind those of perovskites that use organic cations. Here, the state-of-the-art of all-inorganic perovskites for photovoltaic applications is reviewed by performing detailed meta-analyses of key performance parameters on the cell and material level. Key material properties such as carrier mobilities, external photoluminescence quantum efficiency, and photoluminescence lifetime are discussed and what is known about defect tolerance in all-inorganic is compared relative to hybrid (organic&#8211;inorganic) perovskites. Subsequently, a unified approach is adopted for analyzing performance losses in perovskite solar cells based on breaking down the losses into several figures of merit representing recombination losses, resistive losses, and optical losses. Based on this detailed loss analysis, guidelines are eventually developed for future performance improvement of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Material Design Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics without Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed balance theory is applied to explore the performance potential for semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) based on complementary near&#8208;infrared materials. With this theory, ATT&#8208;9 with an optimal ultranarrow bandgap is designed and synthesized. The near&#8208;infrared blend PTB7&#8208;Th:ATT&#8208;9 featuring an ultralow Urbach energy achieves multifunctional ST&#8208;OPVs with an excellent light utilization efficiency and heat&#8208;insulation performance exceeding commercial 3M films.








Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) have drawn great attention for promising applications in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, providing additional power generation for daily use. A previously proposed strategy, &#8220;complementary NIR absorption,&#8221; is widely applied for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. However, rational material design toward high performance has not been achieved. In this work, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) model describing this strategy is developed to explore the full potential of material design on ST&#8208;OPV performance. Guided by the model, a novel nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), ATT&#8208;9, is designed and synthesized, which possesses optimal bandgap for ST&#8208;OPVs, achieving a record short&#8208;circuit current density of 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a power conversion efficiency of 13.40%, the highest value among devices based on NFAs with bandgaps lower than 1.2&#160;eV. It is notworthy that, at such a low bandgap, the energy loss of the device is only 0.58&#160;eV, which is attributed to the low energetic disorder confirmed by an ultralow Urbach energy of 21.6 meV. Benefiting from the optimal bandgap and low energy loss, the ATT&#8208;9&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV achieves a high light utilization efficiency of 3.33% without optical modulations, and meanwhile shows excellent thermal insulation, exceeding the commercial 3M heat&#8208;insulating window film, demonstrating the outstanding application prospects of multifunctional ST&#8208;OPVs.

         <title>Integrated Afterglow and Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Hybrid Metal Halides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to modulate the afterglow and self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emissions in 0D (Ph3S)2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 (x = 0&#8211;1) single crystals. Moreover, the integration of afterglow and STE emissions is realized in (Ph3S)2Sn0.92Te0.08Cl6. These as&#8208;prepared 0D hybrid metal halides with colorful emissions are demonstrated for multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage applications.








Abstract
0D hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) are considered to be promising luminescent emitters. 0D HMHs commonly exhibit self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emissions originating from the inorganic metal halide anion units. Exploring and utilizing the emission features of the organic cation units in 0D HMHs is highly desired to enrich their optical properties as multifunctional luminescent materials. Here, tunable emissions from organic and inorganic units are successfully achieved in triphenylsulfonium (Ph3S+)&#8208;based 0D HMHs. Notably, integrated afterglow and STE emissions with adjustable intensities are obtained in (Ph3S)2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;1) via the delicate combination of [SnCl6]2&#8722; and [TeCl6]2&#8722;. Moreover, such a strategy can be readily extended to develop other HMH materials with intriguing optical properties. As a demonstration, 0D (Ph3S)2Zn1&#8722;xMnxCl4 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;1) are constructed to achieve integrated afterglow and Mn2+ d&#8211;d emissions with high efficiency. Consequently, these novel 0D HMHs with colorful afterglow and STE emissions are applied in multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Materials for Implantable Surface Electrode Arrays: Current Status and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface electrode arrays record from and/or stimulate biological tissues. Existing arrays are mechanically very different from living tissues; devices use rigid and elastic materials while tissues are nonlinearly viscoelastic. Matching the mechanical properties of tissues can reduce damage to native tissue architectures and improve implant conformability. Different material groups processed and fabricated arrays for multiple are discussed.








Abstract
Surface electrode arrays are mainly fabricated from rigid or elastic materials, and precisely manipulated ductile metal films, which offer limited stretchability. However, the living tissues to which they are applied are nonlinear viscoelastic materials, which can undergo significant mechanical deformation in dynamic biological environments. Further, the same arrays and compositions are often repurposed for vastly different tissues rather than optimizing the materials and mechanical properties of the implant for the target application. By first characterizing the desired biological environment, and then designing a technology for a particular organ, surface electrode arrays may be more conformable, and offer better interfaces to tissues while causing less damage. Here, the various materials used in each component of a surface electrode array are first reviewed, and then electrically active implants in three specific biological systems, the nervous system, the muscular system, and skin, are described. Finally, the fabrication of next&#8208;generation surface arrays that overcome current limitations is discussed.

Virtual reality is a brand new technology that can be applied extensively. To realize virtual reality, certain types of human&#226;&#8364;computer interaction equipment are necessary. Existing virtual reality technologies often rely on cameras, data gloves, game pads, and other equipment. These equipment are either bulky, inconvenient to carry and use, or expensive to popularize. Therefore, the development of a convenient and low&#8208;cost high&#8208;precision human&#226;&#8364;computer interaction device will contribute positively to the development of virtual reality technology. In this study, we developed a gesture recognition wristband that can realize a full keyboard and multi&#8208;command input. The wristband is convenient to wear, low in cost, and does not affect other daily operations of the hand. This wristband is based on physiological anatomy as well as aided by active sensor and machine learning technology; it can achieve a maximum accuracy of 92.6% in recognizing 26 letters. This wristband offers broad application prospects in the fields of gesture command recognition, assistive devices for the disabled, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Ambipolar Self&#8208;Host Functionalization Accelerates Blue Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Internal Quantum Efficiency of 100%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambipolar self&#8208;host multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter is constructed with a structure featuring an MR chromophore functionalized with an ambipolar self&#8208;host segment, which preserves blue emission at 472&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum of 28&#160;nm and achieves accelerated singlet radiation and suppressed singlet and triplet non&#8208;radiations, leading to desired &#8776;100% photoluminescence and internal electroluminescence quantum yields.








Abstract
Emerging multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters can combine 100% exciton harvesting and high color purity for their organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). However, the highly planar configurations of MR molecules lead to intermolecular&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced quenching. A feasible way is integrating host segments into MR molecules, namely a &#8220;self&#8208;host&#8221; strategy, but without involving additional charge transfer and/or vibrational components to excited states. Herein, an ambipolar self&#8208;host featured MR emitter, tCBNDADPO, is demonstrated, whose ambipolar host segment (DADPO) significantly and comprehensively improves the TADF properties, especially greatly accelerated singlet radiative rate constant of 2.11 &#215; 108 s&#8722;1 and exponentially reduced nonradiative rate constants. Consequently, at the same time as preserving narrowband blue emission with an FWHM of &#8776;28&#160;nm at a high doping concentration of 30%, tCBNDADPO reveals state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of 99% and 30%, respectively. The corresponding 100% internal quantum efficiency of tCBNDADPO supported by an ultrasimple trilayer and heavily doped device demonstrates the feasibility of the ambipolar self&#8208;host strategy for constructing practically applicable MR materials.

         <title>Aggregation Control, Surface Passivation, and Optimization of Device Structure toward Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with an EQE up to 15.4%</title>

A comprehensive optimization strategy, including 2&#8208;phenylethylammonium ligand (PEA+)&#8208;passivated FAPbI3 quantum dots (QDs), synergistic coverage effects between the QDs and hole&#8208;transporting layers, and effective electron&#8208;transporting layers for constructing a feasible device structure leads to a high&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared (NIR) QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) centered at 772&#160;nm and exhibiting a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 15.4%, the highest external quantum efficiency recorded for perovskite&#8208;based NIR QLEDs.








Abstract
In recent years, the performance of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) and QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) has improved greatly, with electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of green and red emission exceeding 20%. However, the development of perovskite near&#8208;infrared (NIR) QLEDs has reached stagnation, where the reported maximum EL efficiency is still below 6%, limiting their further applications. In this work, new NIR&#8208;emissive FAPbI3 QDs are developed by post&#8208;treating long alkyl&#8208;encapsulated QDs with 2&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The incorporation of PEAI reduces the QD surface defects for giving a high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 61.6%. The n&#8208;octane solution of PEAI&#8208;passivated FAPbI3 QDs is spin coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS&#8208;treated ITO electrode modified with a thermally crosslinked hole&#8208;transporting layer to give a full&#8208;coverage, smooth, and dense QD film. Incorporating with an effective electron&#8208;transporting material, CN&#8208;T2T, which has deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and good electron mobility, the optimal device with EL &#955;max at 772&#160;nm achieves an external quantum efficiency up to 15.4% at a current density of 0.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (2.6&#160;V), which is the highest efficiency ever reported for perovskite&#8208;based NIR QLEDs. This study provides a facile strategy to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite QD films suitable for highly efficient NIR QLED applications.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrZr4Te14 with Large In&#8208;plane Anisotropic Negative Magnetoresistance</title>

Abstract
The discovery of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials is of great significance to explore intriguing 2D magnetic physics and develop innovative spintronic devices. Herein, a new quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (1D) vdW layered compound CrZr4Te14 is successfully synthesized. Owing to the existence of 1D [CrTe2] and [ZrTe3] chains along the b&#8208;axis, CrZr4Te14 crystals show strong anisotropy of phonon vibrations, electrical transport, and magnetism. Density functional theory calculations reveal the ferromagnetic (FM) coupling within the [CrTe2] chain, while the interchain and interlayer couplings are both weakly antiferromagnetic (AF). Notably, a large intrinsic negative magnetoresistance (nMR) of &#8208;56% is achieved at 2 K under 9 T, and the in&#8208;plane anisotropic factor of nMR can reach up to 8.2 in CrZr4Te14 device. The 1D FM chains and anisotropic nMR effect make CrZr4Te14 an interesting platform for exploring novel polarization&#8208;sensitive spintronics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions: Roles of Different N Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Fe catalysts with different types of nitrogen species are synthesized by controlling the pyrolyzing temperature using a hard&#8208;template strategy. Different roles of the nitrogen species in Fenton&#8208;like reactions are revealed. Graphitic N can adsorb the target molecule, pyrrolic N plays an essential role, and pyridinic N has little role in the reactivity of Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon.








Abstract
Recognizing and controlling the structure&#8211;activity relationships of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is vital for manipulating their catalytic properties for various practical applications. Herein, Fe SACs supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (SA&#8208;Fe/CN) are reported, which show high catalytic reactivity (97% degradation of bisphenol A in only 5&#160;min), high stability (80% of reactivity maintained after five runs), and wide pH suitability (working pH range 3&#8211;11) toward Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The roles of different N species in these reactions are further explored, both experimentally and theoretically. It is discovered that graphitic N is an adsorptive site for the target molecule, pyrrolic N coordinates with Fe(III) and plays a dominant role in the reaction, and pyridinic N, coordinated with Fe(II), is only a minor contributor to the reactivity of SA&#8208;Fe/CN. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that a lower d&#8208;band center location of pyrrolic&#8208;type Fe sites leads to the easy generation of Fe&#8208;oxo intermediates, and thus, excellent catalytic properties.

         <title>Gires&#8208;Tournois immunoassay platform for label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bright&#8208;field imaging of nanoscale bioparticles is a challenging task for optical microscopy because the light&#8208;matter interactions of bioparticles are weak on conventional surfaces due to their low refractive index and small size. Alternatively, advanced imaging techniques, including near&#8208;field microscopy and phase microscopy, have enabled visualization and quantification of the bioparticles, but they require assistance of sophisticated/customized systems and post&#8208;processing with complex established algorithms. Here, we present a simple and fast immunoassay device, Gires&#8208;Tournois immunoassay platform (GTIP), which provides unique color dynamics in response to optical environment changes and thus enables the label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles using conventional optical microscopy. Bioparticles on GTIP slow down the velocity of reflected light, leading to vivid color change according to the local particle density and maximizing chromatic contrast for high spatial distinguishability. The particle distribution and density on the surface of the resonator are readily analyzed through 2D raster&#8208;scanning&#8211;based chromaticity analysis. GTIP offers multiscale sensing capability for target analytes that possess different refractive indices and sizes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright-field imaging of nanoscale bioparticles is a challenging task for optical microscopy because the light-matter interactions of bioparticles are weak on conventional surfaces due to their low refractive index and small size. Alternatively, advanced imaging techniques, including near-field microscopy and phase microscopy, have enabled visualization and quantification of the bioparticles, but they require assistance of sophisticated/customized systems and post-processing with complex established algorithms. Here, we present a simple and fast immunoassay device, Gires-Tournois immunoassay platform (GTIP), which provides unique color dynamics in response to optical environment changes and thus enables the label-free bright-field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles using conventional optical microscopy. Bioparticles on GTIP slow down the velocity of reflected light, leading to vivid color change according to the local particle density and maximizing chromatic contrast for high spatial distinguishability. The particle distribution and density on the surface of the resonator are readily analyzed through 2D raster-scanning&#8211;based chromaticity analysis. GTIP offers multiscale sensing capability for target analytes that possess different refractive indices and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries have been rapidly developed recently as promising energy storage devices in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their fast charging capability and high power densities. In recent years, Prussian blue analogues, polyanion&#8208;type compounds, and layered oxides have been widely developed as cathodes for aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries because of their low cost and high theoretical capacity. Furthermore, many design strategies have been proposed to expand their electrochemical stability window by reducing the amount of free water molecules and introducing an electrolyte addictive. This review highlights the advantages and drawbacks of cathode and anode materials, and summarizes the correlations between the various strategies and the electrochemical performance in terms of structural engineering, morphology control, elemental compositions, and interfacial design. Finally, this review can offer rational principles and potential future directions in the design of aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) have received tremendous interest for large&#8208;scale grid storage. This review is the first comprehensive overview devoted to the non&#8208;electrode components in AZBs, including the understandings from the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements and perspectives on electrolytes, solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase, current collectors, binders, and separators. This critical review provides fresh new insights in the future development of AZBs.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are one of the promising options for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage owing to their safety, affordability and environmental friendliness. During the past decade, there have been remarkable advancements in the AZBs technology, which are achieved through intensive efforts not only in the area of electrode materials but also in the fundamental understandings of non&#8208;electrode components such as electrolytes, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), current collectors, binders, and separators. In particular, the breakthroughs in the non&#8208;electrode components should not be underestimated in having enabled the AZBs to attain a higher energy and power density beyond that of the conventional AZBs, proving their critical role. In this article, the recent research progress is comprehensively reviewed with respect to non&#8208;electrode components in AZBs, covering the new&#8208;type of electrolytes that have been introduced, attempts for the tailoring of SEI, and the design efforts for multi&#8208;functional current collectors, binders and separators, along with the remaining challenges associated with these non&#8208;electrode components. Finally, perspectives are discussed toward future research directions in this field. This extensive overview on the non&#8208;electrode components is expected to guide and spur further development of high&#8208;performance AZBs.

         <title>Stiffness Variable Polymers Comprising Phase&#8208;Changing Side&#8208;Chains: Material Syntheses and Application Explorations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers comprising side chains undergoing reversible crystallization and melting in a narrow temperature span have been synthesized for stiffness control. A modulus change of more than 1000&#8208;fold can be achieved. Larger stiffness changes can be obtained. The phase&#8208;changing can additionally be exploited for reversible adhesions, bistable actuation, and opacity modulation. Important applications will be discussed.








Abstract
Stiffness variable materials have been applied in a variety of engineering fields that require adaptation, automatic modulation, and morphing because of their unique property to switch between a rigid, load&#8208;bearing state and a soft, compliant state. Stiffness variable polymers comprising phase&#8208;changing side&#8208;chains (s&#8208;SVPs) have densely grafted, highly crystallizable long alkyl side&#8208;chains in a crosslinked network. Such a bottlebrush network&#8208;like structure gives rise to rigidity modulation as a result of the reversible crystallization and melting of the side chains. The corresponding modulus changes can be more than 1000&#8208;fold within a narrow temperature span, from &#8776;102&#160;MPa to &#8776;102&#160;kPa or lower. Other important properties of the s&#8208;SVP, such as stretchability, optical transmittance, and adhesion, can also be altered. This work reviews the underlying molecular mechanisms in the s&#8208;SVP's, discusses the material's structure&#8211;property relationship, and summarizes important applications explored so far, including reversible shape transformation, bistable electromechanical transduction, optical modulation, and reversible adhesion.

         <title>Mobile Phone Flashlight&#8208;Excited Red Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the rational design of organic luminogens with strong intramolecular charge transfer and optimized molecular geometry, the mobile phone flashlight&#8208;excited red afterglow imaging of lymph nodes in living mice is realized for the first time, offering a safe and conventional approach to realize the afterglow imaging of living mice with deep issue penetration and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime possess the remarkable advantage in bioimaging for elimination of background noise by characteristic time scale. However, most of RTP luminogens need to be excited by the harmful ultraviolet (UV) lamp, and exhibit green or yellow emission with shallow tissue penetration, constraining the in vivo bioimaging for further application in clinical diagnosis and pathological study. In this text, the much safer excitation process by sunlight and mobile phone flashlight is realized by organic luminogens with various electronic pull&#8211;push systems. Moreover, the bright red RTP emission with lifetime up to 344&#160;ms is achieved by optimizing molecular geometry and electronic property. Especially, the mobile phone flashlight&#8208;excited red afterglow imaging of lymph nodes in living mice has been realized for the first time, affording a safe and conventional approach to achieve the afterglow imaging of living mice with deep issue penetration and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Airflow Sensors Based on Suspended Carbon Nanotube Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suspended carbon nanotube networks (SCNTNs) are prepared for fabricating high&#8208;performance airflow sensors. Due to the ultralight and flexible nature of CNTs and their unique junction structures, SCNTN&#8208;based airflow sensors achieved ultrafast response, low detection threshold, high sensitivity, and ultralong cycling lifetime. Acoustic tests and mathematical models show that their high sensing performance originates from the intertube stress at the junctions.

High&#8208;performance airflow sensors are in great demand in numerous fields but still face many challenges, such as slow response speed, low sensitivity, large detection threshold, and narrow sensing range. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit many advantages in fabricating airflow sensors due to their nanoscale diameters, excellent mechanical and electrical properties, and so on. However, the intrinsic extraordinary properties of CNTs are not fully exhibited in previously reported CNT&#8208;based airflow sensors due to the mixed structures of macroscale CNT assemblies. Herein, this article presents suspended CNT networks (SCNTNs) as high&#8208;performance airflow sensors, which are self&#8208;assembled by ultralong CNTs and short CNTs in a one&#8208;step floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition process. The SCNTN&#8208;based airflow sensors achieved a record&#8208;breaking short response time of 0.021 s, a high sensitivity of 0.0124 s m&#8722;1, a small detection threshold of 0.11 m s&#8722;1, and a wide detection range of &#8776;0.11&#8211;5.51 m s&#8722;1, superior to most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art airflow sensors. To reveal the sensing mechanism, an acoustic response testing system and a mathematical model are developed. It is found that the airflow&#8208;caused intertube stress change resulted in the resistance variation of SCNTNs.

&lt;p&gt;Suspended carbon nanotube networks (SCNTNs) are prepared for fabricating high-performance airflow sensors. Due to the ultralight and flexible nature of CNTs and their unique junction structures, SCNTN-based airflow sensors achieved ultrafast response, low detection threshold, high sensitivity, and ultralong cycling lifetime. Acoustic tests and mathematical models show that their high sensing performance originates from the intertube stress at the junctions.

         <title>Effective Approaches for Designing Stable M&#8208;Nx/C Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Catalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>

Abstract
The large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is extremely limited by their costly platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs) catalysts, which are used for catalyzing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. Among the reported PGM&#8208;free catalysts so far, metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;Nx/C) catalysts hold a great potential to replace PGMs catalysts for ORR due to their excellent initial activity and low cost. However, despite tremendous progress in this field in the past decade, their further applications are restricted by fast degradation under practical conditions. In this review, the theoretical fundamentals of the stability of the M&#8208;Nx/C catalysts are firstly introduced in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics. The primary degradation mechanisms of M&#8208;Nx/C catalysts and the corresponding mitigating strategies are discussed in detail. Finally, this review outlines the current challenges and the prospects for designing highly stable M&#8208;Nx/C catalysts.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Conjugated Polymer Nanoplatform for Activatable Companion Diagnostics and Multistage Augmented Synergistic Therapy</title>

A glucose&#8208;oxidase&#8208;based nanoplatform simultaneously realizes photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;based companion diagnostics, photothermal/starvation therapy, and real&#8208;time monitoring of cancer treatment.








Abstract
Companion diagnostics (CDx) provides critical information for precision medicine. However, current CDx is mostly limited to in vitro tests, which cannot accurately evaluate the disease progression and treatment response in real time. To overcome this challenge, herein a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered conjugated polymer (polyaniline, PANI) nanoplatform (denoted as PANITG) is reported for activatable imaging&#8208;based CDx and multistage augmented photothermal/starvation synergistic therapy. PANITG comprises a pH&#8208;activatable conjugated polymer as a photothermal convertor and photoacoustic (PA) emitter, a GOx as a cancer starvation inducer as well as a H2O2 and acid producer, and a H2O2&#8208;cleavable linker as a &#8220;switch&#8221; for GOx activity. The in vivo PA imaging and photothermal therapy abilities are activated by acidic tumor microenvironment and self&#8208;augmented by the reaction between GOx and glucose. Meanwhile, the photothermal effect will enhance the GOx activity in turn. Such multistage augmentation of the therapeutic effects will facilitate effective cancer management. In addition, the in vivo PA imaging with PANITG reveals the tumor pH level which is correlated to the efficiency of the photothermal therapy and to the catalytic activity of GOx at each stage, enabling real&#8208;time activatable CDx.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Crystalline Fullerene Micro&#8208;/Nano&#8208;Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assembly of fullerene molecules into fullerene micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;architectures with desired morphologies and structures can modulate the properties of fullerenes at different dimension scales, targeting diverse applications in such fields as electronics, biology, and energy storage/conversion. This purpose requires efficient strategies to well&#8208;control the seemingly unpredictable and random process as discussed in this review.








Abstract
Fullerenes are a molecular form of carbon allotrope and bear certain solubility, which allow the supramolecular assembly of fullerene molecules&#8212;also together with other complementary compound classes&#8212;via solution&#8208;based wet processes. By well&#8208;programmed organizing these building blocks and precisely modulating over the assembly process, supramolecularly assembled fullerene micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;architectures (FMNAs) are obtained. These FMNAs exhibit remarkably enhanced functions as well as tunable morphologies and dimensions at different size scales, leading to their applications in diverse fields. In this review, both traditional and newly developed assembly strategies are reviewed, with an emphasis on the morphological evolution mechanism of FMNAs. The discussion is then focused on how to precisely regulate the dimensions and morphologies to generate functional FMNAs through solvent engineering, co&#8208;crystallization, surfactant incorporation, or post&#8208;fabrication treatment. In addition to C60&#8208;based FMNAs, this review particularly focuses on recently fabricated FMNAs comprising higher fullerenes (e.g., C70) and metallofullerenes. Meanwhile, an overview of the property modulation is presented and multidisciplinary applications of FMNAs in various fields are summarized, including sensors, optoelectronics, biomedicines, and energy. At the end, the prospects for future research, application opportunities, and challenges associated with FMNAs are proposed.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of Solid&#8208;State Ultraviolet B Emitting Carbon Dots via Acetic Acid&#8208;Promoted Fractions of sp3 Bonding Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state Ultraviolet B emitting carbon dots (UVB&#8208;CDs) with a high quantum yield and a narrow bandwidth are synthesized hydrothermally by using o&#8208;phenylenediamine and excessive acetic acid (AA). The excess AA promotes the deamination process and fractions of sp3&#8208;C in UVB&#8208;CDs, leading to the blue&#8208;shift of emission. The UVB&#8208;CDs show potential application in plant lighting can increase Vitamin C content in basil.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have received tremendous attention for their excellent photoluminescence (PL) properties. However, it remains a great challenge to obtain CDs with ultraviolet (UV, 200&#8211;400&#160;nm) emission in solid state, which requires strict control of the CDs structure and overcoming the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). Herein, a new sp3 compartmentalization strategy is developed to meet these requirements, by employing acetic acid to promote fractions of sp3 bonding during the synthesis of CDs. It markedly decreases the size of sp2 conjugating units in the CDs, and shifts PL emission to the ultraviolet B (UVB) region (&#955;max&#160;= 308&#160;nm). Moreover, sp2 domains are well spatially compartmentalized by sp3 domains and the ACQ effect is minimized, enabling the high quantum yield in solid state (20.2%, &#955;ex&#160;= 265&#160;nm) with a narrow bandwidth of 24&#160;nm and environmental robustness. The solid&#8208;state UVB emissive CDs are highly desired for application in photonic devices. Hence, a demo of UVB light&#8208;emitting diodes is fabricated for plant lighting, leading to a 29% increase of ascorbic acid content in the basil. Overall, a rational and efficient way to construct solid UVB&#8208;CDs phosphors for wide applications is provided.

         <title>An asymmetric hygroscopic structure for moisture&#8208;driven hygro&#8208;ionic electricity generation and storage</title>

Abstract
The interactions between moisture and materials give rise to the possibility of moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG). Current MEG materials and devices only establish this interaction during water sorption in specific configurations, and conversion is eventually ceased by saturated water uptake. This paper reports an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS) that simultaneously achieves energy harvesting and storage from moisture absorption. The AHS is constructed by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a layer of functionalized carbon. Water absorbed from the air creates wet&#8208;dry asymmetry across the AHS and hence an in&#8208;plane electric field. The asymmetry can be perpetually maintained even after saturated water absorption. The absorbed water triggers the spontaneous development of an electrical double layer (EDL) over the carbon surface, which is termed a hygro&#8208;ionic process, accounting for the capacitive properties of the AHS. A peak power density of 70 &#956;W cm&#8211;3 was realised after geometry optimisation. The AHS showed the ability to be recharged either by itself owing to a self&#8208;regeneration effect or via external electrical means, which allows it to serve as an energy storage device. In addition to insights into moisture&#8208;material interaction, AHSs further shows potential for electronics powering in assembled devices.

This paper reports an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS) that simultaneously achieves energy harvesting and storage from moisture absorption. The AHS is constructed by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a layer of functionalized carbon. Water absorbed from the air creates wet-dry asymmetry across the AHS and hence an in-plane electric field. The asymmetry can be perpetually maintained even after saturated water absorption. The absorbed water triggers the spontaneous development of an electrical double layer (EDL) over the carbon surface, which is termed a hygro-ionic process, accounting for the capacitive properties of the AHS. A peak power density of 70 &#956;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;3&lt;/sup&gt; was realised after geometry optimisation.

         <title>High Energy and Stable Subfreezing Aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with Selective and Pseudocapacitive Zn&#8208;ion insertion in MnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One major challenge of aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries for practical applications is their unacceptable performance below freezing temperatures. Here we describe the use of simple Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes for all&#8208;weather Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries even down to &#8208;60&#176;C. The symmetric, bulky ClO4&#8211; anion effectively disrupt hydrogen bonds between water molecules and provides intrinsic ion diffusion even while frozen, and this enabled &#8764; 260 mAh/g on MnO2 cathodes at &#8208;30&#176;C in 3.0M Zn(ClO4)2. We identified that sub&#8208;freezing cycling shifted the reaction mechanism on the MnO2 cathode from unstable H+ insertion to predominately pseudocapacitive Zn2+ insertion, which converted MnO2 nanofibers into complicated zincated MnOx that were largely disordered and appeared as crumpled paper sheets. The Zn2+ insertion at &#8208;30&#176;C is faster and much more stable than at 20&#176;C, and delivered &#8764;80% capacity retention for 1000 cycles without any Mn2+ additives. In addition, simple Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte also enabled a nearly fully reversible and dendrite free Zn anode at &#8208;30&#176;C with &#8764;98% columbic efficiency. We further demonstrate Zn&#8208;MnO2 prototypes with an experimentally verified unit energy density of 148 Wh/kg with a N/P ratio of 1.5 and a E/C ratio of 2.0, which provide feasible approaches to advance all&#8208;weather aqueous batteries.

         <title>Exchange bias in molecule/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures via spinterface effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The exfoliation of layered magnetic materials generates atomically thin flakes characterized by an ultrahigh surface sensitivity, which makes their magnetic properties tunable via external stimuli, such as electrostatic gating and proximity effects. Another powerful approach to engineer magnetic materials is molecular functionalization, generating hybrid interfaces with tailored magnetic interactions, called spinterfaces. However, spinterface effects have not yet been explored on layered magnetic materials.
Here, we demonstrate the emergence of spinterface effects at the interface between flakes of the prototypical layered magnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 and thin films of Co&#8208;phthalocyanine. Magnetotransport measurements show that the molecular layer induces a magnetic exchange bias in Fe3GeTe2, indicating that the unpaired spins in Co&#8208;phthalocyanine develop antiferromagnetic ordering and pin the magnetization reversal of Fe3GeTe2 via magnetic proximity. The effect is strongest for a Fe3GeTe2 thickness of 20 nm, for which the exchange bias field reaches &#8211;840 Oe at 10 K and is measurable up to approximately 110 K. This value compares very favorably with previous exchange bias fields reported for Fe3GeTe2 in all&#8208;inorganic van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating the potential of molecular functionalization to tailor the magnetism of van der Waals layered materials.

         <title>Corrosion Chemistry of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalysts are the core components of many sustainable energy conversion technologies that are considered the most potential solution to the worldwide energy and environmental crises. The reliability of structure and composition pledges that electrocatalysts can achieve predictable and stable performance. However, during the electrochemical reaction, electrocatalysts are influenced directly by applied potential, electrolyte and the adsorption/desorption of reactive species, triggering structural and compositional corrosions, which directly affect the catalytic behavior of electrocatalysts (performance degradation or enhancement) and invalidate the established structure&#8208;activity relationship. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the corrosion behavior and mechanism of electrocatalysts in order to formulate targeted corrosion&#8208;resistant strategies or utilize corrosion reconstruction synthesis techniques to guide the preparation of efficient and stable electrocatalysts. This study outlines the most recent developments in electrocatalyst corrosion chemistry, including corrosion mechanisms, mitigation strategies and corrosion syntheses/reconstructions based on typical materials and important electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, potential opportunities and challenges are also proposed to foresee the possible development in this field. We believe that this contribution will raise more awareness regarding nanomaterial corrosion chemistry in energy technologies and beyondim.

         <title>Modularizable liquid crystal&#8208;based open surfaces enable programmable chemical transport and feeding using liquid droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Droplet&#8208;based miniature reactors have attracted interest in both fundamental studies, for the unique reaction kinetics they enable, and applications in bio&#8208;diagnosis and material synthesis. However, the precise and automatic feeding of chemicals, important for the delicate reactions in these miniaturized chemical reactors, either requires complex, high&#8208;cost microfluidic devices or lacks the capability to maintain a pinning&#8208;free droplet movement. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a new class of liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based open surfaces which enable a controlled chemical release via a programmable LC phase transition without sacrificing the free transport of the droplets. We demonstrate that their intrinsic slipperiness and self&#8208;healing properties enable a modularizable assembly of LC surfaces which can be loaded with different chemicals to achieve a wide range of chemical reactions carried out within droplets, including sequential and parallel chemical reactions, crystal growth and polymer synthesis. Finally, we develop an LC&#8208;based chemical feeding device that can automatically control the release of chemicals to direct the simultaneous differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into endothelial progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes. Overall, our LC surfaces exhibit desirable levels of automation, responsiveness, and controllability for use in miniature droplet carriers and reactors.

A novel strategy, i.e., seed&#8208;crystal&#8208;induced cold sintering process, is pioneered. High oriented transparency can be obtained in large&#8208;area metal halide transparent ceramic scintillators, leading to very high light yield &#8776;78&#8239;000 photons per MeV, energy resolution of 17% for high&#8208;energy &#947;&#8208;rays (662&#160;keV), recorded detection limit 8.8 nanograys per second, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging of (15.7 lp mm&#8722;1) simultaneously.








Abstract
Scintillators with high spatial resolution at a low radiation dose rate are desirable for X&#8208;ray medical imaging. To challenge the state&#8208;of&#8208;art technology, it is necessary to design large&#8208;area wafers with high light yield, oriented light transport, and reduced light scattering. Here, a seed&#8208;crystal&#8208;induced cold sintering is adopted and a &lt;001&gt;&#8208;textured TPP2MnBr4 (TPP: tetraphenylphosphonium) transparent ceramic is fabricated with a large&#8208;area wafer of 5&#160;cm in diameter, exhibiting high optical transparency of above 68% over the 450&#8211;600&#160;nm range. The compelling scintillation performance of the TPP2MnBr4 wafer includes a light yield of &#8776;78&#160;000&#160;&#177; 2000 photons per MeV, a low detection limit 8.8 nanograys per second, about 625 times lower than the requirement of X&#8208;ray diagnostics (5500 nanograys per second), and an energy resolution of 17% for high&#8208;energy &#947;&#8208;rays (662&#160;keV). X&#8208;ray imaging demonstrates a high spatial resolution of 15.7 lp mm&#8722;1. Moreover, the designed material exhibits good retention of the radioluminescence intensity and light yield. This work presents a paradigm for achieving light&#8208;guiding properties with high transparency and large&#8208;area fabrication by grain orientation engineering, and the transparent, textured metal halide ceramic scintillator is expected to provide a route for advancement in the X&#8208;ray imaging of tomorrow.

         <title>Crosstalk&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution pressure sensor arrays enabled by high&#8208;throughput laser manufacturing</title>

Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high spatial resolution and low crosstalk interference has been a fundamental challenge for flexible pressure sensor arrays. Here we present a high&#8208;resolution flexible pressure sensor array fabricated through a two&#8208;step laser manufacturing process, where individual sensing pixels and their interconnects are sequentially defined by laser&#8208;induced graphenization and ablation to minimize crosstalk interferences. The geometry of the interconnects is optimized through theoretical modeling and experimental validation. Characterization results show that the new device design induces a remarkable reduction of the crosstalk coefficient, from &#8208;8.21 dB to &#8208;43.63 dB, of the 0.7 mm&#8208;resolution sensor arrays, and the crosstalk suppression is particularly beneficial for application scenarios involving pressure sensing on soft surfaces (e.g. human skin and organs). Applications of the sensor array in tactile pattern recognition and minimally&#8208;invasive cancer surgery are demonstrated.

         <title>Plasmonic Fluorescence Enhancement in Diagnostics for Clinical Tests at Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care: A Review of Recent Technologies</title>

Abstract
Fluorescence&#8208;based biosensors have widely been used in the life&#8208;sciences and biomedical applications due to their low limit of detection and a diverse selection of fluorophores that enable simultaneous measurements of multiple biomarkers. Recent research effort has been made to implement fluorescence&#8208;based biosensors into the exploding field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), which uses cost&#8208;effective strategies for rapid and affordable diagnostic testing. However, challenges remain to transition fluorescence&#8208;based sensors towards POCT due to their feeble signal at low concentrations of the analyte, which often require sophisticated, costly, and bulky instrumentation to maintain high detection sensitivity. Metal&#8208; and metal oxide&#8208;based nanostructures offer a simple solution to increase the output signal from fluorescence&#8208;based biosensors due to the generation of high field enhancements close to a metal or metal oxide surface, which has been shown to improve the excitation rate, quantum yield, photostability, and radiation pattern of fluorophores. This review provides an overview of existing biosensors that employ various strategies for fluorescence enhancement via nanostructures and have demonstrated the potential for sensitive and rapid diagnostic testing. Biosensors using nanostructures such as planar substrates, free&#8208;standing nanoparticles, and metal&#8208;dielectric&#8208;metal nanocavities are discussed with an emphasis placed on technologies that have shown promise towards POCT applications without the need for centralized laboratories.

         <title>High Efficiency of Over 25% and Long Device Lifetime of Over 500 h at 1,000 nit in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
In this study, we synthesized, characterized and evaluated a multiple resonance (MR) type blue emitter for highly efficient and stable blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The MR blue fluorescent emitter had a di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl benzene substituent in the MR core sturuture to minimize quenching mechanisms by intermolecular interaction. The emitter showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield and small full width at half maximum of 22 nm, which realized high external quantum efficiency of 11.4% in the single unit OLED and device lifetime up to 95% of the initial luminance (LT95) of 208 hrs at 1,000 cd/m2 and over 10,000 hrs at 100 cd/m2. The optimized tandem device of the new blue emitter achieved high external quantum efficiency over 25% and extremely long LT95 of over 500 hrs at 1000 cd/m2 and 30,000 hrs at 100 cd/m2. The lifetime of this work is one of the best data of blue OLED lifetime reported in the literature.

         <title>Building Practical High&#8208;voltage Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
It has long been a global imperative to develop high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to meet the ever&#8208;growing electric vehicle market. One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of LIBs is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. As the most promising cathodes for high&#8208;voltage LIBs (&gt; 4&#160;V versus Li/Li+), four major categories of cathodes including lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides, nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides, spinel oxides, and high&#8208;voltage polyanionic compounds still encounter severe challenges to realize the improvement of output voltage while maintaining high capacity, fast rate capability and long service life. This review focuses on the key links in the development of the high&#8208;voltage cathode materials from lab to industrialization. Firstly, the failure mechanisms of the four kinds of materials are clarified, and the optimization strategies, particularly the solutions which are easy for large&#8208;scale production, are focused. Then, to bridge the gap between lab and industry, the cost management, safety assessment, practical battery performance evaluation, and sustainability of battery technologies, are discussed, too. Finally, tough challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials are summarized to promote the large&#8208;scale application of LIBs with high energy densities.

         <title>Foldable Solid&#8208;state Batteries Enabled by Electrolyte Mediation in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high Li+ conductivity, flexibility, durability, and stability offer an attractive solution to enhance safety and energy density. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses challenges to the existing solid polymeric or ceramic electrolytes. Here, we present an electrolyte&#8208;mediated single&#8208;Li+ conductive covalent organic framework (COF) that represents a new category of quality solid&#8208;state Li+ conductors. In situ solidification of a tailored liquid electrolyte boosts the charge&#8208;carrier concentration in the COF channels, decouples Li+ cations from both COF walls and molecular chains, and eliminates defects by crystal soldering. Such an altered micro&#8208;environment activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner, which leads to an increase in Li+ conductivity by 100 times with a transference number of 0.85 achieved at room temperature. Moreover, the electrolyte conversion cements the ultrathin COF membrane with fortified mechanical toughness. With the COF membrane, foldable solid&#8208;state pouch cells are demonstrated.

Here, we present an electrolyte-mediated single-Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductive covalent organic framework (COF) that represents a new category of quality solid-state Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductors. In situ solidification of a tailored liquid electrolyte boosts the charge-carrier concentration in the COF channels, decouples Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations from both COF walls and molecular chains, and eliminates defects by crystal soldering. Such an altered micro-environment activates the motion of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in a directional manner, which leads to an increase in Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity by 100 times with a transference number of 0.85 achieved at room temperature. Moreover, the electrolyte conversion cements the ultrathin COF membrane with fortified mechanical toughness. With the COF membrane, foldable solid-state pouch cells are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Preparation of high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells without strict environmental control is an inevitable trend of commercialization. Humidity is considered the main factor hindering perovskite performance. Formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskites suffer from the instability of photoactive black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, especially in humid air, and numerous defects in the surface and bulk of perovskite films limit their performance. In this work, we introduce long chain n&#8208;heptylamine (nHA) via antisolvent engineering into an FA&#8208;based perovskite film. nHA removes the negative intermediate adduct and promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behaviour. Moreover, the existence of nHA in the final perovskite film also reduces the defects and suppresses ion migration. The champion device delivers a PCE of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis, and the fabricated devices exhibit superior reproductivity. The device stability is also enhanced, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE after 1500 hours in ambient air. Moreover, the PCE has no attenuation at the maximum power point under continuous 1&#8208;sun light soaking for 500 hours. The universality of present method is also demonstrated by other perovskite compositions, including MAPbI3 and FAxMA1&#8208;xPbI3 in humid air.

A high&#8208;performance&#160;indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide&#8208;free organic photovoltaic (OPV) with superior flexibility and upscaling capacity is demonstrated. The OPV device adopts a top&#8208;illuminated structure optimized by an anode buffer layer and charge collecting grid, and delivers a record efficiency of 15.56%. Moreover, the flexible OPV exhibits no degradation after 100&#160;000 bending cycles with a radius of 4&#160;mm, which represents the best result for flexible OPVs.








Abstract
Developing indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide (ITO)&#8208;free flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with upscaling capacity is of great significance for practical applications of OPVs. Unfortunately, the efficiencies of the corresponding devices lag far behind those of ITO&#8208;based rigid small&#8208;area counterparts. To address this issue, an advanced device configuration is designed and fabricated featuring a top&#8208;illuminated structure with ultrathin Ag as the transparent electrode. First, a conjugated polyelectrolyte layer, i.e., PCP&#8208;Li, is inserted to effectively connect the bottom Ag anode and the hole transport layer, achieving good photon to electron conversion. Second, charge collecting grids are deposited to suppress the increased resistance loss with the upscaling of the device area, realizing almost full retention of device efficiency from 0.06 to 1 cm2. Third, the designed device delivers the best efficiency of 15.56% with the area of 1 cm2 on polyimide substrate, representing as the record among the ITO&#8208;free, large&#8208;area, flexible OPVs. Interestingly, the device exhibits no degradation after 100&#160;000 bending cycles with a radius of 4&#160;mm, which is the best result for flexible OPVs. This work provides insight into device structure design and optimization for OPVs with high efficiency, low cost, superior flexibility, and upscaling capacity, indicating the potential for the future commercialization of OPVs.

         <title>Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystal Lithium Titanate Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous single&#8208;crystal architecture is performed on the spinel Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode for ultrafast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The unique interconnected porous structure of LTO microrods significantly shortens the Li+ ion diffusion length and facilitates electrolyte mass transportation. The single&#8208;crystalline nature of these LTO microrods is well preserved even after 10&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
There remain significant challenges in developing fast&#8208;charging materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to sluggish ion diffusion kinetics and unfavorable electrolyte mass transportation in battery electrodes. In this work, a mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline lithium titanate (MSC&#8208;LTO) microrod that can realize exceptional fast charge/discharge performance and excellent long&#8208;term stability in LIBs is reported. The MSC&#8208;LTO microrods are featured with a single&#8208;crystalline structure and interconnected pores inside the entire single&#8208;crystalline body. These features not only shorten the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion distance but also allow for the penetration of electrolytes into the single&#8208;crystalline interior during battery cycling. Hence, the MSC&#8208;LTO microrods exhibit unprecedentedly high rate capability, achieving a specific discharge capacity of &#8776;174 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, which is very close to its theoretical capacity, and &#8776;169 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C. More importantly, the porous single&#8208;crystalline microrods greatly mitigate the structure degradation during a long&#8208;term cycling test, offering &#8776;92% of the initial capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 C. This work presents a novel strategy to engineer porous single&#8208;crystalline materials and paves a new venue for developing fast&#8208;charging materials for LIBs.

         <title>Boosting Energy Efficiency and Stability of Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Synergy between Ru Atom Clusters and Single&#8208;Atom Ru&#8211;N4 sites in the Electrocatalyst Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst comprising ruthenium (Ru) atomic clusters and single&#8208;atom sites (RuAC+SA) is fabricated for boosting the energy efficiency and stability of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. The improved CO2 reduction and evolution reaction kinetics stem from the unique electronic synergy between the adjacent Ru atomic cluster assemblies and Ru&#8211;N4 active sites.








Abstract
The Li&#8211;CO2 battery is a novel strategy for CO2 capture and energy&#8208;storage applications. However, the sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions cause large overpotential and poor cycling performance. Herein, a new catalyst containing well&#8208;defined ruthenium (Ru) atomic clusters (RuAC) and single&#8208;atom Ru&#8211;N4 (RuSA) composite sites on carbon nanobox substrate (RuAC+SA@NCB) (NCB = nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanobox) is fabricated by utilizing the different complexation effects between the Ru cation and the amine group (&#63743;NH2) on carbon quantum dots or nitrogen moieties on NCB. Systematic experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the vital role of electronic synergy between RuAC and Ru&#8211;N4 in improving the electrocatalytic activity toward the CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The electronic properties of the Ru&#8211;N4 sites are essentially modulated by the adjacent RuAC species, which optimizes the interactions with key reaction intermediates thereby reducing the energy barriers in the rate&#8208;determining steps of the CO2RR and CO2ER. Remarkably, the RuAC+SA@NCB&#8208;based cell displays unprecedented overpotentials as low as 1.65&#160;and 1.86&#160;V at ultrahigh rates of 1&#160;and 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and twofold cycling lifespan than the baselines. The findings provide a novel strategy to construct catalysts with composite active sites comprising multiple atom assemblies for high&#8208;performance metal&#8211;CO2 batteries.

Remarkably, the Ru&lt;sub&gt;AC+SA&lt;/sub&gt;@NCB-based cell displays unprecedented overpotentials as low as 1.65&#160;and 1.86&#160;V at ultrahigh rates of 1&#160;and 2&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and twofold cycling lifespan than the baselines. The findings provide a novel strategy to construct catalysts with composite active sites comprising multiple atom assemblies for high-performance metal&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Screen for Antiviral T&#8208;Cell Immunity with Nanowire Electrochemical Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible multichannel silicon&#8208;nanowire field&#8208;effect transistors, a device for rapid and label&#8208;free detection of human T&#8208;cell immune responses is developed. The generalizability of this approach is demonstrated by measuring T&#8208;cell responses against melanoma antigen MART1, common viruses CMV, EBV, flu, as well as emergent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Nanowire devices successfully assess SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;specific T&#8208;cells directly from peripheral blood samples of donors, demonstrating potential point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications in rapid detection of antigen&#8208;specific T cells.








Abstract
The ability to rapidly assess and monitor patient immune responses is critical for clinical diagnostics, vaccine design, and fundamental investigations into the presence or generation of protective immunity against infectious diseases. Recently, findings on the limits of antibody&#8208;based protection provided by B&#8208;cells have highlighted the importance of engaging pathogen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cells for long&#8208;lasting and broad protection against viruses and their emergent variants such as in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, low&#8208;cost and point&#8208;of&#8208;care tools for detecting engagement of T&#8208;cell immunity in patients are conspicuously lacking in ongoing efforts to assess and control population&#8208;wide disease risk. Currently available tools for human T&#8208;cell analysis are time and resource&#8208;intensive. Using multichannel silicon&#8208;nanowire field&#8208;effect transistors compatible with complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor, a device designed for rapid and label&#8208;free detection of human T&#8208;cell immune responses is developed. The generalizability of this approach is demonstrated by measuring T&#8208;cell responses against melanoma antigen MART1, common and seasonal viruses CMV, EBV, flu, as well as emergent pandemic coronavirus, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Further, this device provides a modular and translational platform for optimizing vaccine formulations and combinations, offering quick and quantitative readouts for acquisition and persistence of T&#8208;cell immunity against variant&#8208;driven pathogens such as flu and pandemic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>12.42% Monolithic 25.42 cm2 Flexible Organic Solar Cells Enabled by an Amorphous ITO&#8208;Modified Metal Grid Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
12.42% monolithic 25.42 cm2 flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) are reported based on the nanogrid electrodes modified by amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) modification layer. The modification of amorphous ITO also ensures excellent air shelf stability, as well as mechanical properties.








Abstract
Printed metal nanogrid electrode exhibits superior characteristics for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the high surface roughness and inhomogeneity between grid and blank region is adverse for performance improvement. In this work, a thin amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) film (&#945;&#8208;ITO) is introduced to fill the blank and to improve the charge transporting. The introduction of &#945;&#8208;ITO significantly improves the comprehensive properties of metal grid electrode, which exhibits excellent bending resistance and long&#8208;term stability under double 85 condition (under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity) for 200 h. Both experimental and simulation results reveal &#945;&#8208;ITO with a sheet resistance of 20&#8239;000 &#937; &#9633;&#8722;1 is sufficient to improve the charge transporting within the adjacent grids, leading to a remarkable efficiency of 16.54% for 1 cm2 flexible devices. With area increased to 4.00, 9.00, and 25.42 cm2, the devices still display a performance of 16.22%, 14.69%, and 12.42%, respectively, showing less efficiency loss during upscaling. And the 25.42 cm2 monolithic flexible device exhibits a certificated efficiency of 12.03%. Moreover, the device shows significantly improved air stability relative to conventional high&#8208;conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate&#8208;modified device. All these make the &#945;&#8208;ITO&#8208;modified Ag/Cu electrode promise to achieve high&#8208;efficient and long&#8208;term stable large&#8208;area flexible OSCs.

         <title>Passive Ultra&#8208;Conductive Thermal Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents passive ultra&#8208;conductive thermal metamaterials. A wide range of effective thermal conductivity beyond natural conductive materials is achieved, in the absence of extra energy payload. In addition, tunable thermal interfacial effect is unfolded in an &#8220;analog&#8221; fashion. The findings may open long&#8208;ignored possibilities of achieving ultra&#8208;conductive thermal materials and robust thermal management in the context of pure conduction.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;conductive heat transport showcases significant potentials in popular thermal managements with convection, phase change, and heat source. However, it is captivated impossible for passive thermal manipulation, usually bounded by intrinsic thermal conductivities of natural materials, to outperform these active recipes in need of extra energy payload. Here, a robust recipe to create passive ultra&#8208;conductive thermal metamaterials consisting of nothing but bulk natural materials is reported. Thanks to the local thermal resistance regulation by vertical thermal transport channel, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermal metamaterials experimentally demonstrate extreme effective conductivity (1915&#160;W&#160;m&#8211;1&#160;K&#8211;1) solely with naturally occurring materials. The purely conductive modulation without any external energy is comparable to active counterparts, and further reveals its robustness and unexpected convenience. The findings construct a high&#8208;efficient paradigm of passive thermal management with ultra&#8208;conductive heat transport, and further hint potentials in other Laplace fields, e.g., DC and magnetostatics.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intramolecular Motion&#8208;Induced Photothermy for Tumor Phototheranostics and Tooth Root Canal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused two isoindigo (DIID)&#8208;based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles are designed and synthesized with high near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;harvesting capacity, excellent photothermal conversion property due to the active excited&#8208;state intramolecular twist around the central double bonds in DIID, and amplified photoacoustic signal by enlarging the Gr&#252;neisen parameter. The nanoparticles give effective performances in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy of tumors and tooth root canal therapy.








Abstract
Much effort is devoted to develop agents with superior photoacoustic/photothermal properties for improved disease diagnosis and treatment. Herein, a new fused two isoindigo (DIID)&#8208;based semiconducting conjugated polymer (named PBDT&#8208;DIID) is rationally designed and synthesized with a strong near&#8208;infrared absorption band ranging from 700 to 1000&#160;nm. Water&#8208;dispersing nanoparticles (NPs) of PBDT&#8208;DIID are prepared with good biocompatibility and a rather high photothermal conversion efficiency (70.6%), as the active excited&#8208;state intramolecular twist around the central double bonds in DIID permits most of the absorbed excitation energy flow to heat deactivation pathway through internal conversion. The photoacoustic signal can be further magnified by incorporation of polylactide (PLA) in the NP core to confine the generated heat of PBDT&#8208;DIID within NPs. The resultant doped NPs show excellent performance in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in an orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. It is also found that the photothermal effect of the PBDT&#8208;DIID NPs is safe and quite efficacious to highly improve the root canal treatment outcome by heating the 1% NaClO solution inside the root canal upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation in a human extracted tooth root canal infection model.

         <title>Atomically Sharp Lateral Superlattice Heterojunctions Built&#8208;in Nitrogen&#8208;doped Nanoporous Graphene</title>

Abstract
Nanometer scale lateral heterostructures with atomically sharp band discontinuities can be conceived as the two&#8208;dimensional analogues of vertical Van der Waals heterostructures, where pristine properties of each component coexist with interfacial phenomena that result in a variety of exotic quantum phenomena. However, despite considerable advances in the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, controlling their covalent interfaces and band discontinuities with atomic precision, scaling down components and producing periodic, lattice&#8208;coherent superlattices still represent major challenges. Here, a synthetic strategy to fabricate nanometer scale, coherent lateral superlattice heterojunctions with atomically sharp band discontinuity is reported. By merging interdigitated arrays of different type of graphene nanoribbons by means of a novel on&#8208;surface reaction, superlattices of one&#8208;dimensional, chemically heterogeneous nanoporous junctions are obtained. The latter host subnanometer quantum dipoles and tunneling in&#8208;gap states, altogether expected to promote interfacial phenomena such as interribbon excitons or selective photocatalysis.

         <title>Adaptive Biosensing and Neuromorphic Classification Based on an Ambipolar Organic Mixed ionic&#8208;electronic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are central to bioelectronic applications such as biosensors, health monitoring devices and neural interfaces, and have facilitated efficient next&#8208;generation brain&#8208;inspired computing and biohybrid systems. Despite these examples, smart and adaptive circuits that can locally process and optimize biosignals have not yet been realized. Here we show a tunable sensing circuit that can locally modulate biologically relevant signals like electromyogram (EMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) that is based on a complementary logic inverter combined with a neuromorphic memory element and that is constructed from a single polymer mixed conductor. We demonstrate that a small neuromorphic array based on this material effects high classification accuracy in heartbeat anomaly detection. This high&#8208;performance material allows for straightforward monolithic integration, which reduces fabrication complexity while also achieving high on/off ratios with excellent ambient p&#8208; and n&#8208; type stability in transistor performance. This material opens a route towards simple and straightforward fabrication and integration of more sophisticated adaptive circuits for future smart bioelectronics.

         <title>Rational Development of a Polysaccharide&#8208;Protein&#8208;Conjugated Nanoparticle Vaccine Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants and Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has led to millions of deaths worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) remains a major cause of mortality in underdeveloped countries. A vaccine that prevents both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and S. pneumoniae infection represents a long&#8208;sought &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;. Herein, we rationally developed a nanoparticle vaccine, termed SCTV01B, by using the capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 (PPS14) as the backbone to conjugate with the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. The final formulation of conjugated nanoparticles in the network structure exhibits high thermal stability. Immunization with SCTV01B induces potent humoral and Type 1/Type 2 T helper cell (Th1/Th2) cellular immune responses in mice, rats and rhesus macaques. In particular, SCTV01B&#8208;immunized serum not only broadly cross&#8208;neutralizes all SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern (VOCs), including the most recent Omicron variant, but also shows high opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against S. pneumoniae serotype 14. Finally, SCTV01B vaccination confers protection against challenge with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mouse adapted strain and the original strain in established murine models. Collectively, these promising preclinical results support further clinical evaluation of SCTV01B, highlighting the potency of polysaccharide&#8208;RBD&#8208;conjugated nanoparticle vaccine platforms for the development of vaccines for COVID&#8208;19 and other infectious diseases.

         <title>Flexible Metamaterial Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over the last decade, extensive efforts have been made on utilizing advanced materials and structures to improve the properties and functionalities of flexible electronics. While the conventional ways are approaching their natural limits, a revolutionary strategy, namely metamaterials, is emerging toward engineering structural materials to break the existing fetters. Metamaterials exhibit supernatural physical behaviors, in aspects of mechanical, optical, thermal, acoustic, and electronic properties that are inaccessible in natural materials, such as tunable stiffness or Poisson's ratio, manipulating electromagnetic or elastic waves, and topological and programmable morphability. These salient merits motivate metamaterials as a brand&#8208;new research direction and have inspired extensive innovative applications in flexible electronics. Here, such a groundbreaking interdisciplinary field is first coined as &#8220;flexible metamaterial electronics&#8221;, focusing on enhancing and innovating functionalities of flexible electronics via the design of metamaterials. Herein, we review the latest progress and trends in this infant field whilst highlighting their potential value. First, a brief overview starts with introducing the combination of metamaterials and flexible electronics. Then, the developed applications are discussed, such as self&#8208;adaptive deformability, ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and multidisciplinary functionality, followed by the discussion of potential prospects. Finally, we summarize the challenges and opportunities facing flexible metamaterial electronics to advance this cutting&#8208;edge field.

         <title>Double&#8208;Lattice Packing of Pentagonal Gold Bipyramids in Supercrystals with Triclinic Symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pentagonal packing is a long&#8208;standing issue and a rich mathematical topic, brought to the fore by recent progress in nanoparticle design. Gold pentagonal bipyramids combine five&#8208;fold symmetry and anisotropy and their section varies along the length. In this work, we obtain colloidal supercrystals of pentagonal gold bipyramids in a compact arrangement that generalizes the optimal packing of regular pentagons in the plane. Multimodal investigations reveal a two&#8208;particle unit cell with triclinic symmetry, a lower symmetry than that of the building blocks. Monte Carlo computer simulations show that this lattice achieves the densest possible packing. Going beyond pentagons, further simulations show an odd&#8208;even effect of the number of sides on the packing: odd&#8208;sided bipyramids are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and require the double&#8208;lattice arrangement to recover inversion symmetry. The supercrystals display a facet&#8208;dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications and for fundamental studies of self&#8208;assembly processes.

         <dc:description>
This review paper addresses the key challenges in vat polymerization and bioresin development for use in tissue engineering and regenerative applications. The paper provides a perspective on the unique bioresin design criteria and processing strategies required to aid the development of novel bioresins for vat polymerization and unlock the next evolution of biofabrication.








Abstract
The field of bioprinting has made significant advancements in recent years and allowed for the precise deposition of biomaterials and cells. However, within this field lies a major challenge, which is developing high resolution constructs, with complex architectures. In an effort to overcome these challenges a biofabrication technique known as vat polymerization is being increasingly investigated due to its high fabrication accuracy and control of resolution (&#181;m scale). Despite the progress made in developing hydrogel precursors for bioprinting techniques, such as extrusion&#8208;based bioprinting, there is a major lack in developing hydrogel precursor bioresins for vat polymerization. This is due to the specific unique properties and characteristics required for vat polymerization, from lithography to the latest volumetric printing. This is of major concern as the shortage of bioresins available has a significant impact on progressing this technology and exploring its full potential, including speed, resolution, and scale. Therefore, this review discusses the key requirements that need to be addressed in successfully developing a bioresin. The influence of monomer architecture and bioresin composition on printability is described, along with key fundamental parameters that can be altered to increase printing accuracy. Finally, recent advancements in bioresins are discussed together with future directions.

         <title>Realization of a Half Metal with a Record&#8208;High Curie Temperature in Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half metals have promising applications in advanced spintronic devices. A new half metal LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 with a record&#8208;high Curie temperature (TC) in perovskite oxides, combining with a wide spin&#8208;up energy gap (Eg) and a large magnetization (MN), is synthesized. The current LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 thus shows the best synthetic performance (TC&#160;&#215; Eg&#160;&#215; MN) among all half&#8208;metallic oxides discovered so far.








Abstract
Half metals, in which one spin channel is conducting while the other is insulating with an energy gap, are theoretically considered to comprise 100% spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, and thus have promising applications in high&#8208;efficiency magnetic sensors, computer memory, magnetic recording, and so on. However, for practical applications, a high Curie temperature combined with a wide spin energy gap and large magnetization is required. Realizing such a high&#8208;performance combination is a key challenge. Herein, a novel A&#8208; and B&#8208;site ordered quadruple perovskite oxide LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 with the charge format of Cu2+/Fe3+/Re4.5+ is reported. The strong Cu2+(&#8593;)Fe3+(&#8593;)Re4.5+(&#8595;) spin interactions lead to a ferrimagnetic Curie temperature as high as 710 K, which is the reported record in perovskite&#8208;type half metals thus far. The saturated magnetic moment determined at 300 K is 7.0 &#956;B f.u.&#8722;1 and further increases to 8.0 &#956;B f.u.&#8722;1 at 2 K. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal a half&#8208;metallic nature with a spin&#8208;down conducting band while a spin&#8208;up insulating band with a large energy gap up to 2.27&#160;eV. The currently unprecedented realization of record Curie temperature coupling with the wide energy gap and large moment in LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 opens a way for potential applications in advanced spintronic devices at/above room temperature.

         <title>Negative Phototransistors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Weak&#8208;Light Detection Based on 1D/2D Molecular Crystal p&#8208;n Heterojunctions and their Application in Light Encoders</title>

Abstract
Anomalous negative phototransistors (NPTs) that the channel current decreases under light illumination hold potential to generate novel and multifunctional optoelectronic applications. Although a variety of design strategies have been developed to construct such devices, NPTs still suffer from far lower device performance compared to well&#8208;developed positive phototransistors (PPTs). Here, a novel 1D/2D molecular crystal p&#8208;n heterojunction, in which p&#8208;type 1D molecular crystal (1DMC) arrays are embedded into n&#8208;type 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs), is developed to produce ultrasensitive NPTs. The p&#8208;type 1DMC arrays act as light&#8208;absorbing layers to induce p&#8208;doping of n&#8208;type 2DMCs through charge transfer under illumination, resulting in ineffective gate control and significant negative photoresponses. As a result, the NPTs show remarkable performances in photoresponsivity (1.9&#215;108) and detectivity (1.7&#215;1017 Jones), which greatly outperform previously reported NPTs and are one of the highest values among all organic phototransistors. Moreover, the device exhibits intriguing characteristics undiscovered in PPTs, including precise control of the threshold voltage by controlling light signals and ultrasensitive detection of weak light. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NTPs are demonstrated as light encoders that can encrypt electrical signal by light. These findings represent a milestone for negative phototransistors, and pave the way for development of future novel optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Performance for Three&#8208;Way Catalysis</title>

Abstract
In response to growing levels of air pollution and emission regulations, novel three&#8208;way catalysts (TWCs) with high efficiency are highly coveted. Herein, we demonstrate a multi&#8208;step heating strategy to fabricate a unique dual&#8208;site catalyst composed of strongly&#8208;coupled Pt and Pd atoms located in neighboring positions on the surface of CeO2. They possess outstanding three&#8208;way catalytic performance, especially for NO elimination. Based on comprehensive investigations, the enhancement is attributed to the strong interactions between neighboring Pt and Pd atoms, which can separately serve as the active site for CO and NO adsorption, efficiently reducing the energy barrier and accelerating the reaction rate. These findings not only contribute to designing and constructing next&#8208;generation catalysts, but also provide a promising opportunity to improve fuel efficiency and control emissions.

         <title>Materials Engineering for Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in material and architecture engineering of air&#8208;water&#8208;harvesting materials have promoted remarkable progress toward the atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology. This perspective discusses the fundamental insights of how different material designs affect the water&#8208;material interactions in advancing AWH technology.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is emerging as a promising strategy to produce fresh water from abundant airborne moisture to overcome the global clean water shortage. The ubiquitous moisture resources allow AWH to be free from geographical restrictions and potentially realize decentralized applications, making it a vital parallel or supplementary freshwater production approach to liquid water resource&#8208;based technologies. Recent advances in regulating chemical properties and micro/nanostructures of moisture&#8208;harvesting materials have demonstrated new possibilities to promote enhanced device performance and new understandings. This perspective aims to provide a timely overview on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials design and how they serve as the active components in AWH. First, the key processes of AWH, including vapor condensation, droplet nucleation, growth, and departure are outlined, and the desired material properties based on the fundamental mechanisms are discussed. Then, how tailoring materials&#8208;water interactions at the molecular level play a vital role in realizing high water uptake and low energy consumption is shown. Last, the challenges and outlook on further improving AWH from material designs and system engineering aspects are highlighted.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Ultrathin Highly Crystalline Pt&#8211;Ni Nanostructure on a Metal Carbide Template for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;carbide&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth strategy is demonstrated as an effective method for fabricating highly active Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Owing to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;favored facets and high active surface area, the derived ultrathin highly crystalline Pt3Ni nanocages display excellent ORR activity. This novel method offers a promising and economical routine for design excellent noble metal electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Structure engineering strategies such as core&#8211;shell and hollow nanostructures are effective pathways to improve the utilization of noble metals for catalysis. However, nowadays materials design based on these strategies still largely rely on precious metal templates. Herein, the epitaxial growth of highly crystalline Pt3Ni overlayer on earth&#8208;abundant nickel carbide is reported, forming Ni3C@Pt3Ni core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with a well&#8208;defined interface through a new lattice&#8208;match&#8208;directed synthetic strategy. Derived from such core&#8211;shell nanostructures, ultrathin highly crystalline Pt3Ni nanocages have an advantageous configuration of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;favored facets and inherently high active surface area for the ORR, bringing high mass activity and specific activity as much as 4.71&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 and 5.14&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which are 26 and 20 times to that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. This novel epitaxial growth of platinum opens up new avenues to rationally design highly active and economical electrocatalysts.

         <title>Biodegradable Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Gated Organosilica for Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Unlocked Glutathione&#8208;Depletion&#8208;Enhanced Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;unlocked nanoformula is judiciously designed by the smart use of a biodegradable metal&#8211;organic framework to gate the pores of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles. This method can not only realize acidic&#8208;TME&#8208;responsive cisplatin release, but also deplete glutathione and simultaneously catalyze the generation of &#8226;OH via Cu2+ for highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific synergistic chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy against cancer with negligible biosafety concerns.








Abstract
The clinical employment of cisplatin (cis&#8208;diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP)) is largely constrained due to the non&#8208;specific delivery and resultant serious systemic toxicity. Small&#8208;sized biocompatible and biodegradable hollow mesoporous organosilica (HMOS) nanoparticles show superior advantages for targeted CDDP delivery but suffer from premature CDDP leakage. Herein, the smart use of a bimetallic Zn2+/Cu2+ co&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is made to block the pores of HMOS for preventing potential leakage of CDDP and remarkably increasing the loading capacity of HMOS. Once reaching the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), the outer MOF can decompose quickly to release CDDP for chemotherapy against cancer. Besides, the concomitant release of dopant Cu2+ can deplete the intracellular glutathione (GSH) for increased toxicity of CDDP as well as catalyzing the decomposition of intratumoral H2O2 into highly toxic &#8226;OH for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Moreover, the substantially reduced GSH can also protect the yielded &#8226;OH from scavenging and thus greatly improve the &#8226;OH&#8208;based CDT effect. In addition to providing a hybrid HMOS@MOF nanocarrier, this study is also expected to establish a new form of TME&#8208;unlocked nanoformula for highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific GSH&#8208;depletion&#8208;enhanced synergistic chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Van der Waals Heterostructures for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D van der Waals nanosheets from molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted electrochemical exfoliation are assembled to form building blocks for wafer&#8208;scale electronics. By using graphene, MoS2 and single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube, and oxidized HfS2 as metallic, n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type semiconducting, and insulating building blocks, various devices are realized including field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, p&#8211;n diodes, and complementary logic gates.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) materials have been considered as potential building blocks for use in fundamental elements of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as electrodes, channels, and dielectrics, because of their diverse and remarkable electrical properties. Furthermore, two or more building blocks of different electronic types can be stacked vertically to generate vdW heterostructures with desired electrical behaviors. However, such fundamental approaches cannot directly be applied practically because of issues such as precise alignment/positioning and large&#8208;quantity material production. Here, these limitations are overcome and wafer&#8208;scale vdW heterostructures are demonstrated by exploiting the lateral and vertical assembly of solution&#8208;processed 2D vdW materials. The high exfoliation yield of the molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted approach enables the production of micrometer&#8208;sized nanosheets in large quantities and its lateral assembly in a wafer&#8208;scale via vdW interactions. Subsequently, the laterally assembled vdW thin&#8208;films are vertically assembled to demonstrate various electronic device applications, such as transistors and photodetectors. Furthermore, multidimensional vdW heterostructures are demonstrated by integrating 1D carbon nanotubes as a p&#8208;type semiconductor to fabricate p&#8211;n diodes and complementary logic gates. Finally, electronic devices are fabricated via inkjet printing as a lithography&#8208;free manner based on the stable nanomaterial dispersions.

         <title>Ultrafast Shaped Laser Induced Synthesis of MXene Quantum Dots/Graphene for Transparent Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers an in situ, one&#8208;step strategy using temporally and spatially shapedlaser for simultaneous photochemically synthesizing of the transparent MXene quantum dot/laser reduced graphene oxide composite electrodes with ultrahigh transparency and energy storage. A new process for preparing transparent electrode is proposed, which also takes into account both high transparency and performance.








Abstract
Ultratransparent electrodes have attracted considerable attention in optoelectronics and energy technology. However, balancing energy storage capability and transparency remains challenging. Herein, an in situ strategy employing a temporally and spatially shaped femtosecond laser is reported for photochemically synthesizing of MXene quantum dots (MQDs) uniformly attached to laser reduced graphene oxide (LRGO) with exceptional electrochemical capacitance and ultrahigh transparency. The mechanism and plasma dynamics of the synthesis process are analyzed and observed at the same time. The unique MQDs loaded on LRGO greatly improve the specific surface area of the electrode due to the nanoscale size and additional edge states. The MQD/LRGO supercapacitor has high flexibility and durability, ultrahigh energy density (2.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2), long cycle life (97.6% after 12&#160;000 cycles), and excellent capacitance (10.42&#160;mF cm&#8722;2) with both high transparency (transmittance over 90%) and high performance. Furthermore, this method provides a means of preparing nanostructured composite electrode materials and exploiting quantum capacitance effects for energy storage.

         <title>Asymmetric Chemical Functionalization of Top&#8208;Contact Electrodes: Tuning the Charge Injection for High&#8208;Performance MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors and Schottky Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically functionalized electrodes are integrated in top&#8208;contact field&#8208;effect MoS2 transistors by contact engineering through the dry transfer of self&#8208;assembled monolayers pre&#8208;modified electrodes. Charge injection is optimized by using ad hoc thiolated molecules with controlled dipole moments, thereby boosting the device performance. When asymmetrically functionalized electrodes are employed, Schottky diodes with a high rectification ratio could be realized.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;performance (opto&#8208;)electronic devices based on 2D channel materials requires the optimization of the charge injection at electrode&#8211;semiconductor interfaces. While chemical functionalization with chemisorbed self&#8208;assembled monolayers has been extensively exploited to adjust the work function of metallic electrodes in bottom&#8208;contact devices, such a strategy has not been demonstrated for the top&#8208;contact configuration, despite the latter being known to offer enhanced charge&#8208;injection characteristics. Here, a novel contact engineering method is developed to functionalize gold electrodes in top&#8208;contact field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) via the transfer of chemically pre&#8208;modified electrodes. The source and drain Au electrodes of the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) FETs are functionalized with thiolated molecules possessing different dipole moments. While the modification of the electrodes with electron&#8208;donating molecules yields a marked improvement of device performance, the asymmetric functionalization of the source and drain electrodes with different molecules with opposed dipole moment enables the fabrication of a high&#8208;performance Schottky diode with a rectification ratio of &#8776;103. This unprecedented strategy to tune the charge injection in top&#8208;contact MoS2 FETs is of general applicability for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance (opto&#8208;)electronic devices, in which asymmetric charge injection is required, enabling tailoring of the device characteristics on demand.

         <title>Observation of 3D Biexcitons in Pristine&#8208;Quality CH3NH3PbBr3 Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the existence of biexcitons in high&#8208;quality 3D perovskite single crystals is demonstrated based on the series of clear&#8208;cut spectroscopic evidences: i) exciton&#8211;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two&#8208;photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann&#8208;type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs) are fascinating materials whose optoelectronic properties are arguably excitonic. In the HP family, biexcitons are known to exist only in low dimensions where exciton&#8211;exciton binding is strongly enhanced by quantum and dielectric confinements. In this paper, however, it is shown that they indeed do exist in 3D bulk CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) single crystals if the pristine crystal quality is ensured for subtle binding of two excitons. The existence of biexcitons is clearly evidenced below 30 K with a binding energy of &#8776;3.9 &#177; 0.3 meV according to i) exciton&#8211;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two&#8208;photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann&#8208;type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence. Because of the polariton effect, the two&#8208;photon resonance occurs at the excited biexciton state from which longitudinal&#8208;transverse splitting is calculated to be 3.7 meV. The discovery of the 3D biexcitons underscores the very quality of HP crystals for generating various many&#8208;body excitonic phases in MAPbBr3 and its analogues toward the improved understanding of their fundamental properties and highly efficient optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Photosensitizer Nanodot Eliciting Immunogenicity for Photo&#8208;Immunologic Therapy of Postoperative Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infection and Secondary Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By eliciting infection&#8208;related immunogenicity to achieve a higher level of active immunologic responses during acute phase infection and long&#8208;term immunosurveillance, AgB nanodots under near&#8208;infrared irradiation can demonstrate excellent antibacterial results through photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ions. This strategy could solve the predicament remaining in postoperative methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related infection and prevent recurrence.








Abstract
The treatment of postoperative infection caused by multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has become an intractable clinical challenge owing to its low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence. Apart from imperfect antibacterial therapies, induction of insufficient immunogenicity, required for the successful clearance of a pathogen, may also contribute to the problem. Herein, an ultra&#8208;micro photosensitizer, AgB nanodots, using photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ion sterilization, are utilized to efficiently clear invading MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. AgB nanodots are also found to upregulate host immunogenicity in a murine model and establish immunological memory by promoting the upregulated expression of danger signals that are commonly induced by stress&#8208;related responses, including sudden temperature spikes or excess reactive oxygen production. These stimulations boost the antibacterial effects of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, or even memory B cells, which is usually defined as infection&#8208;related immunogenic cell death. Hence, the proposed AgB nanodot strategy may offer a novel platform for the effective treatment of postoperative infection while providing a systematic immunotherapeutic strategy to combat persistent infections, thereby markedly reducing the incidence of recurrence following recovery from primary infections.

         <title>Spiral Growth of Adlayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of adlayer graphene spirals and onions with novel spiral arms by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is confirmed. These CVD&#8208;prepared graphene spirals and onions exhibit more than one arm (with two, three, four, and five arms) together with clockwise and anticlockwise direction of rotation of each arm, which can be reproduced by using the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.








Abstract
The morphology of as&#8208;grown graphene in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments is sensitive to the reaction environment. Understanding the mechanism of formation of different graphene morphologies is essential to achieve controlled graphene CVD growth. Here the growth and formation mechanism of adlayer graphene spirals are reported. An adlayer graphene spiral is formed by fast propagation of the tips of spiral arms along the edge of the first graphene layer. The driving force to form spirals is the limited availability of carbon diffusing from the Cu surface through the edge of the first graphene layer. In addition, it is found that graphene onions are formed by overlapping graphene spirals with clockwise and anticlockwise arms. Based on these features, a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method is demonstrated using which all the observed graphene spiral structures are successfully reproduced at the atomic level. This study thus unravels the hither&#8208;to unresolved mechanism of graphene onion growth and paves the way to the controllable growth of few&#8208;layer graphene by increasing the carbon supply at the edge of the first layer graphene.

         <title>Fluorination&#8208;Enhanced Surface Stability of Disordered Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of Mn&#8208;based cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathodes with increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Fx, x&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) is revealed. Associated with the reduced O redox activity, F in the DRX mitigates the formation of an O&#8208;deficient surface upon cycling, therefore leading to increased stability of the DRX cathode.








Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxides are a promising new class of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their capacity fade presents a major challenge. Partial fluorine (F) substitution into the oxygen (O) lattice appears to be an effective strategy for improving the cycling stability, but the underlying atomistic mechanism remains elusive. Here, using a combination of advanced transmission electron microscopy based imaging and spectroscopy techniques, the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of Mn&#8208;based DRX cathodes with an increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Fx, x&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) are probed. The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of the DRX is revealed. It is discovered that, due to the reduced O redox activity while with increasing F concentration, F in the DRX lattice mitigates the formation of an O&#8208;deficient surface layer upon cycling. For low F&#8208;substituted DRX, the O loss near the surface results in the formation of an amorphous cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer and nanoscale voids after extended cycling. Increased F concentration in the DRX lattice minimizes both O loss and the interfacial reactions between DRX and the liquid electrolyte, enhancing the surface stability of DRX. These results provide guidance on the development of next&#8208;generation cathode materials through anion substitution.

&lt;p&gt;The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high-level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of Mn-based cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathodes with increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;F&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) is revealed. Associated with the reduced O redox activity, F in the DRX mitigates the formation of an O-deficient surface upon cycling, therefore leading to increased stability of the DRX cathode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxides are a promising new class of high-energy-density cathode materials for next-generation Li-ion batteries. However, their capacity fade presents a major challenge. Partial fluorine (F) substitution into the oxygen (O) lattice appears to be an effective strategy for improving the cycling stability, but the underlying atomistic mechanism remains elusive. Here, using a combination of advanced transmission electron microscopy based imaging and spectroscopy techniques, the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of Mn-based DRX cathodes with an increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;F&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) are probed. The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high-level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of the DRX is revealed. It is discovered that, due to the reduced O redox activity while with increasing F concentration, F in the DRX lattice mitigates the formation of an O-deficient surface layer upon cycling. For low F-substituted DRX, the O loss near the surface results in the formation of an amorphous cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer and nanoscale voids after extended cycling. Increased F concentration in the DRX lattice minimizes both O loss and the interfacial reactions between DRX and the liquid electrolyte, enhancing the surface stability of DRX. These results provide guidance on the development of next-generation cathode materials through anion substitution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Competitive Coordination&#8208;Oriented Monodispersed Ruthenium Sites in Conductive MOF/LDH Hetero&#8208;Nanotree Catalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF)/layered double hydroxide (LDH) hetero&#8208;nanotree structure coupled with monodisperse Ru sites is constructed via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy. Based on a competitive coordination process, Ru&#63743;N sites are precisely anchored by rich&#8208;amino organic linkers. The chemical and electronic structure of the hetero&#8208;nanotree catalysts are well modified and lead to a superior overall water&#8208;splitting performance in alkaline media.








Abstract
Rational exploration of efficient, inexpensive, and robust electrocatalysts is critical for the efficient water splitting. Conjugated conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) with multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to construct bifunctional heterostructure catalysts are considered as an efficient but complicated strategy. Here, the fabrication of a cMOF/LDH hetero&#8208;nanotree array catalyst (CoNiRu&#8208;NT) coupled with monodispersed ruthenium (Ru) sites via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy is reported. Rich&#8208;amino hexaiminotriphenylene linkers coordinate with the LDH nanotrunk to form cMOF nanobranches, providing numerous anchoring sites to precisely confine and stabilize Ru&#63743;N4 sites. Moreover, monodispersed and reduced Ru moieties facilitate H2O adsorption and dissociation, and the heterointerface between the cMOF and the LDH further modifies the chemical and electronic structures. Optimized CoNiRu&#8208;NT displays a significant increase in electrochemical water&#8208;splitting properties in alkaline media, affording low overpotentials of 22&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 255&#160;mV at 20 mA cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. In an actual electrochemical system, CoNiRu&#8208;NT drives an overall water splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.47&#160;V to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This performance is comparable to that of pure noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials and superior to most reported MOF&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Vertical Extrusion Cryo(bio)printing for Anisotropic Tissue Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting technique is reported, which concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. This method is further extended to a multimaterial format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.








Abstract
Due to the poor mechanical properties of many hydrogel bioinks, conventional 3D extrusion bioprinting is usually conducted based on the X&#8211;Y plane, where the deposited layers are stacked in the Z&#8208;direction with or without the support of prior layers. Herein, a technique is reported, taking advantage of a cryoprotective bioink to enable direct extrusion bioprinting in the vertical direction in the presence of cells, using a freezing plate with precise temperature control. Of interest, vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. Skeletal myoblasts within the 3D&#8208;cryo&#8208;bioprinted hydrogel constructs show enhanced cell viability, spreading, and alignment, compared to the same cells in the standard hydrogel constructs. This method is further extended to a multimaterial format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, such as creation of the muscle&#8211;tendon unit and the muscle&#8211;microvascular unit. The unique vertical 3D cryo&#8208;bioprinting technique presented here suggests improvements in robustness and versatility to engineer certain tissue types especially those anisotropic in nature, and may extend broad utilities in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.

A cascade&#8208;targeting drug delivery system (DDS) based on mannose&#8208;decorated poly(&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;phenylalanine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;aminoalanine) is proposed. The DDS targets macrophages and intracellular MRSA in a cascade manner, going through a procedure of macrophages&#8208;specific endocytosis, lysosome escape, intracellular methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus targeting, and on&#8208;site rifampicin release. The DDS shows a distinguished performance for eliminating intracellular MRSA regardless of their latent or dormant states.








Abstract
Intracellular bacteria in latent or dormant states tolerate high&#8208;dose antibiotics. Fighting against these opportunistic bacteria has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, the design of a cascade&#8208;targeting drug delivery system (DDS) that can sequentially target macrophages and intracellular bacteria, exhibiting on&#8208;site drug delivery, is reported. The DDS is fabricated by encapsulating rifampicin (Rif) into mannose&#8208;decorated poly(&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;phenylalanine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;aminoalanine) nanoparticles, denoted as Rif@FAM NPs. The mannose units on Rif@FAM NPs guide the initial macrophage&#8208;specific uptake and intracellular accumulation. After the uptake, the detachment of mannose in acidic phagolysosome via Schiff base cleavage exposes the d&#8208;aminoalanine moieties, which subsequently steer the NPs to escape from lysosomes and target intracellular bacteria through peptidoglycan&#8208;specific binding, as evidenced by the in situ/ex situ co&#8208;localization using confocal, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Through the on&#8208;site Rif delivery, Rif@FAM NPs show superior in vitro and in vivo elimination efficiency than the control groups of free Rif or the DDSs lacking the macrophages&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;targeting moieties. Furthermore, Rif@FAM NPs remodel the innate immune response of the infected macrophages by upregulating M1/M2 polarization, resulting in a reinforced antibacterial capacity. Therefore, this biocompatible DDS enabling macrophages and bacteria targeting in a cascade manner provides a new outlook for the therapy of intracellular pathogen infection.

Multivariate analysis sets relevant statistical correlation between the X&#8208;ray structure and electronic features of [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ and their photo&#8208; and electroluminescent features in thin&#8208;films to elucidate the best complex design for the first blue and white light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells, outperforming the prior art.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) comprising only [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ have not been reported yet, as all the attempts toward blue&#8208;emitting complexes failed. Multivariate analysis, based on prior&#8208;art [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based thin&#8208;film lighting (&gt;90&#160;papers) and refined with computational calculations, identifies the best blue&#8208;emitting [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ design for LECs, that is, N^N: 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine and P^P: 4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene, to achieve predicted thin&#8208;film emission at 490&#160;nm and device performance of 3.8&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@170&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Validation comes from synthesis, X&#8208;ray structure, thin&#8208;film spectroscopic/microscopy/electrochemical characterization, and device optimization, realizing the first [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue&#8208;LEC with 3.6&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@180&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This represents a record performance compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tricoordinate Cu(I)&#8208;complexes blue&#8208;LECs (0.17&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@20&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2). Versatility is confirmed with the synthesis of the analogous complex with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyrazine (N^N), showing a close prediction/experiment match: &#955;&#160;=&#160;590/580&#160;nm; efficiency&#160;=&#160;0.55/0.60&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@30&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Finally, experimental design is applied to fabricate the best white multicomponent host:guest LEC, reducing the number of trial&#8208;error attempts toward the first white all&#8208;[Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;LECs with 0.6&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@30&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This corresponds to approximately ten&#8208;fold enhancement compared to previous LECs (&lt;0.05&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@&lt;12&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2). Hence, this work sets in the first multivariate approach to design emitters/active layers, accomplishing first&#8208;class [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue/white LECs that were&#160;previously elusive.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Printheads for Spatial and Temporal Control of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal printheads that are triggered by chemical/biochemical stimuli permit local control of the synthesis of a range of polymeric structures. The printheads use chemical/biochemical stimuli as inputs, perform on&#8208;board computations via interactions programmed by the liquid crystal, and then output spatially and temporally controlled polymerization processes.








Abstract
Polymerization reactions triggered by stimuli play a pivotal role in materials science, with applications ranging from lithography to biomedicine to adaptive materials. However, the development of chemically triggered, stimuli&#8208;responsive systems that can confer spatial and temporal control on polymerization remains a challenge. Herein, chemical&#8208;stimuli&#8208;induced polymerization based on a liquid crystal (LC) printhead is presented. The LC responds to a local chemical stimulus at its aqueous interface, resulting in the ejection of initiator into the solution to trigger polymerization. Various LC printhead geometries are designed, allowing programming of: i) bulk solution polymerization, ii) synthesis of a thin surface&#8208;confined polymeric coating, iii) polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers to form various nanostructures (sphere, worm&#8208;like, and vesicles), and iv) 3D polymeric structures printed according to local solution conditions. The approach is demonstrated using amphiphiles, multivalent ions, and biomolecules as stimuli.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Precisely Prescribed Multi&#8208;Prodrug Combination by an Engineered Nanocarrier enables Efficient Individualized Cancer Chemotherapy</title>

Polymeric prodrug strategy ensures ratiometric loading and synchronized release of in vitro screened drug combinations under the premise of uniform nanoproperty. The scalable nanoparticles made from a pre&#8208;determined prodrug combination and cascade&#8208;responsive vehicle precisely deliver any drug combination into tumor tissue, facilitating the translational research of individualized combination therapy.








Abstract
The limited anticancer drug library and the frequent occurrence of drug resistance have driven monotherapy&#8208;based cancer therapy into a difficult situation. Considering the formidable process of new drug discovery, combination therapy using currently available drugs is a potential alternative. Nevertheless, the barrier between in vitro combination screening and precise in vivo delivery remains insurmountable in the current free&#8208;drug&#8208; or nanoparticle (NP)&#8208;based combination therapy, which substantially hinders the application of combination therapy. Herein, a novel, precise drug delivery strategy to realize efficient and individualized combination therapy is proposed. Nanomedicine (NM) is engineered using a microfluidics&#8208;based mixer by combining rationally designed polymeric prodrugs of three commercial chemotherapeutics and a cascade&#8208;responsive block copolymer; the NM possesses ratiometric drug loading and synchronized drug release. In addition to quantitative drug loading and precisely controlled drug combination, consistent nanoproperties of these NPs make their in vivo fate predictable. Consequently, tumor growth and metastasis can be effectively inhibited by precisely prescribed NPs derived from in vitro combination screening. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study clearly reveals the feasibility of overcoming the current drug&#8208;library limitations through precise delivery of any predetermined drug combination, facilitating translational research of individualized combination therapy.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Electrical Conductivity in Filler&#8208;Free Polymeric Hydrogels Toward Thermoelectrics and Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEDOT:PSS hydrogels exhibit high conductivities up to &#8776;305 S cm&#8722;1, which is &#8776;8 times higher than the record of polymeric hydrogels without conductive fillers. The high electrical conductivity results in enhanced areal thermoelectric output power for hydrogel&#8208;based thermoelectric devices, and high specific electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency (an order in magnitude higher than that of reported of state&#8208;of&#8208;the art conductive hydrogels).








Abstract
Conducting hydrogels have attracted much attention for the emerging field of hydrogel bioelectronics, especially poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) based hydrogels, because of their great biocompatibility and stability. However, the electrical conductivities of hydrogels are often lower than 1 S cm&#8722;1 which are not suitable for digital circuits or applications in bioelectronics. Introducing conductive inorganic fillers into the hydrogels can improve their electrical conductivities. However, it may lead to compromises in compliance, biocompatibility, deformability, biodegradability, etc. Herein, a series of highly conductive ionic liquid (IL) doped PEDOT:PSS hydrogels without any conductive fillers is reported. These hydrogels exhibit high conductivities up to &#8776;305 S cm&#8722;1, which is &#8776;8 times higher than the record of polymeric hydrogels without conductive fillers in literature. The high electrical conductivity results in enhanced areal thermoelectric output power for hydrogel&#8208;based thermoelectric devices, and high specific electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency which is about an order in magnitude higher than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conductive hydrogels in literature. Furthermore, these stretchable (strain &gt;30%)&#160;hydrogels exhibit fast self&#8208;healing, and shape/size&#8208;tunable properties, which are desirable for hydrogel bioelectronics and wearable organic devices. The results indicate that these highly conductive hydrogels are promising in applications such as sensing, thermoelectrics, EMI shielding, etc.

         <title>Retina&#8208;Inspired Color&#8208;Cognitive Learning via Chromatically Controllable Mixed Quantum Dot Synaptic Transistor Arrays</title>

         <dc:description>
An artificial visual perception system that enables full&#8208;range visible color recognition by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of precisely designed size&#8208;mixed quantum dot photoabsorbers and amorphous In&#8211;Ga&#8211;Zn&#8211;O semiconducting channels is proposed. Moreover, this artificial photonic synapse shows chromatically controllable synaptic plasticity by gate field modulation, inducing multiple selective nonvolatile detection modes.








Abstract
Artificial photonic synapses are emerging as a promising implementation to emulate the human visual cognitive system by consolidating a series of processes for sensing and memorizing visual information into one system. In particular, mimicking retinal functions such as multispectral color perception and controllable nonvolatility is important for realizing artificial visual systems. However, many studies to date have focused on monochromatic&#8208;light&#8208;based photonic synapses, and thus, the emulation of color discrimination capability remains an important challenge for visual intelligence. Here, an artificial multispectral color recognition system by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of ratio&#8208;controllable mixed quantum dot (M&#8208;QD) photoabsorbers and metal&#8208;oxide semiconducting channels is proposed. The biological photoreceptor inspires M&#8208;QD photoabsorbers with a precisely designed red (R), green (G), and blue (B)&#8208;QD ratio, enabling full&#8208;range visible color recognition with high photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion efficiency. In addition, adjustable synaptic plasticity by modulating gate bias allows multiple nonvolatile&#8208;to&#8208;volatile memory conversion, leading to chromatic control in the artificial photonic synapse. To ensure the viability of the developed proof of concept, a 7 &#215; 7 pixelated photonic synapse array capable of performing outstanding color image recognition based on adjustable wavelength&#8208;dependent volatility conversion is demonstrated.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Synthesis of Flash Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash Joule heating is a process that synthesizes nanomaterials from low&#8208;value materials or waste. However, the parameters that drive this synthesis remain ambiguous. This work applies machine learning (ML) tools to study the crystallization of amorphous carbon into flash graphene by flash Joule heating. ML models show the ability to predict flash graphene crystallinity with an r2 score of 0.8051.








Abstract
Advances in nanoscience have enabled the synthesis of nanomaterials, such as graphene, from low&#8208;value or waste materials through flash Joule heating. Though this capability is promising, the complex and entangled variables that govern nanocrystal formation in the Joule heating process remain poorly understood. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are constructed to explore the factors that drive the transformation of amorphous carbon into graphene nanocrystals during flash Joule heating. An XGBoost regression model of crystallinity achieves an r2 score of 0.8051 &#177; 0.054. Feature importance assays and decision trees extracted from these models reveal key considerations in the selection of starting materials and the role of stochastic current fluctuations in flash Joule heating synthesis. Furthermore, partial dependence analyses demonstrate the importance of charge and current density as predictors of crystallinity, implying a progression from reaction&#8208;limited to diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics as flash Joule heating parameters change. Finally, a practical application of the ML models is shown by using Bayesian meta&#8208;learning algorithms to automatically improve bulk crystallinity over many Joule heating reactions. These results illustrate the power of ML as a tool to analyze complex nanomanufacturing processes and enable the synthesis of 2D crystals with desirable properties by flash Joule heating.

         <title>A Ferrotoroidic Candidate with Well&#8208;Separated Spin Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrotoroidic order is one of the four primary ferroic order forms. Ba6Cr2S10 is reported to be a rare ferrotoroidic candidate with well&#8208;separated 1D spin chain, where the spins are dimerized and antiferromagnetic&#8208;like coupled and the toroidal moment is composed of only two antiparallel spins.








Abstract
The search of novel quasi&#8208;1D materials is one of the important aspects in the field of material science. Toroidal moment, the order parameter of ferrotoroidic order, can be generated by a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail configuration of magnetic moment. It has been theoretically proposed that 1D dimerized and antiferromagnetic (AFM)&#8208;like spin chain hosts ferrotoroidicity and has the toroidal moment composed of only two antiparallel spins. Here, the authors report a ferrotoroidic candidate of Ba6Cr2S10 with such a theoretical model of spin chain. The structure consists of unique dimerized face&#8208;sharing CrS6 octahedral chains along the c axis. An AFM&#8208;like ordering at &#8776;10 K breaks both space&#8208; and time&#8208;reversal symmetries and the magnetic point group of mm&#8242;2&#8242;allows three ferroic orders in Ba6Cr2S10: (anti)ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferrotoroidic orders. Their investigation reveals that Ba6Cr2S10 is a rare ferrotoroid ic candidate with quasi 1D spin chain, which can be considered as a starting point for the further exploration of the physics and applications of ferrotoroidicity.

         <title>Emerging Long&#8208;Range Order from a Freeform Disordered Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general framework for emerging long&#8208;range ordered phase distribution in a freeform disordered metasurface is established based on disorder parameter engineering and topology optimization. Within this general framework, the order distribution and the corresponding functionality can be inversely optimized and artificially designed, offering a new freedom to design material functionality.








Abstract
Recently, disordered metasurfaces have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in imaging, holography, and wavefront shaping. However, how to emerge long&#8208;range ordered phase distribution in disordered metasurfaces remains an outstanding problem. Here, a general framework is proposed to generate a spatially homogeneous in&#8208;plane phase distribution from a disordered metasurface, by engineering disorder parameters together with topology optimization. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an all&#8208;dielectric disordered supercell metasurface with relatively homogeneous in&#8208;plane phase fluctuation is designed by disorder parameter engineering, manifesting as polarization conversion&#8208;dependent random scattering or unidirectional transmission. Then, a topology optimization approach is utilized to overcome the lattice coupling effect and to further improve the homogeneity of complex electric field fluctuation. In comparison with the initial supercell metasurface, both the phase fluctuation range and the relative efficiency of the topology&#8208;optimized freeform metasurface are significantly improved, leading to a long&#8208;range ordered electric field distribution. Moreover, three experimental realizations are performed, all of which agree well with the theoretical results. This methodology may inspire more exotic optical phenomena and find more promising applications in disordered metasurfaces and disordered&#160;optics.

         <title>Manipulating Exchange Bias in a Van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces are formed for generating a non&#8208;antisymmetric exchange bias, where ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 is coupled to antiferromagnetic CrSe with a noncollinear spin texture and oxidized Fe3GeTe2 with a weak antiferromagnetic order. This exchange bias can be manipulated with field coolings, which opens up new routes toward controlling 2D spintronic devices based on van der Waals magnets.








Abstract
Spintronics applications of thin&#8208;film magnets require control and design of specific magnetic properties. Exchange bias, originating from the pinning of spins in a ferromagnet by these of an antiferromagnet, is a part of the highly important elements for spintronics applications.

     alt="Manipulating Exchange Bias in a Van der Waals Ferromagnet"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces are formed for generating a non-antisymmetric exchange bias, where ferromagnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is coupled to antiferromagnetic CrSe with a noncollinear spin texture and oxidized Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a weak antiferromagnetic order. This exchange bias can be manipulated with field coolings, which opens up new routes toward controlling 2D spintronic devices based on van der Waals magnets.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spintronics applications of thin-film magnets require control and design of specific magnetic properties. Exchange bias, originating from the pinning of spins in a ferromagnet by these of an antiferromagnet, is a part of the highly important elements for spintronics applications. Here, an exchange bias of &#8776;90 mT in a van der Waals ferromagnet encapsulated by two antiferromagnets at 5 K, the value of which is highly tunable by the field coolings, is reported. The non-antisymmetric dependence of exchange bias on field cooling is explained through considering an uncompensated interfacial magnetic layer of an antiferromagnet with a noncollinear spin texture, and a weak antiferromagnetic order in the oxidized layer, at two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces. This work opens up new routes toward designing and controlling 2D spintronic devices made of atomically thin van der Waals magnets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene on Chromia: A System for Beyond&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust spin&#8208;dependent transport is demonstrated well beyond room temperature in heterostructures of graphene and the antiferromagnetic oxide chromia. The spin&#8208;dependent transport is attributed to the symmetry&#8208;breaking action of chromia, and persists at zero magnetic field and despite the absence of any ferromagnetic elements in the devices. These results represent an important advance for practical spintronics based on graphene.








Abstract
Evidence of robust spin&#8208;dependent transport in monolayer graphene, deposited on the (0001) surface of the antiferromagnetic (AFM)/magneto&#8208;electric oxide chromia (Cr2O3), is provided. Measurements performed in the non&#8208;local spin&#8208;Hall geometry reveal a robust signal that is present at zero external magnetic field and which is significantly larger than any possible ohmic contribution. The spin&#8208;related signal persists well beyond the N&#233;el temperature (&#8776;307 K) that defines the transition between the AFM and paramagnetic states, remaining visible at the highest studied temperature of close to 450 K. This robust character is consistent with prior theoretical studies of the graphene/Cr2O3 system, predicting that the lifting of sub&#8208;lattice symmetry in the graphene shall induce an effective spin&#8211;orbit term of &#8776;40 meV. Overall, the results indicate that graphene&#8208;on&#8208;chromia heterostructures are a highly promising framework for the implementation of spintronic devices, capable of operation well beyond room temperature.

         <title>Super Water&#8208;Extracting Gels for Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management in the Hydrological Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super water&#8208;extracting gels (SWEGs) based on hypercrosslinked hydrophilic polymeric networks are developed for pure vapor generation powered by sunlight. SWEGs reject volatile solutes in water and their dynamic hydrogen bonding networks allow water transport for evaporation. SWEGs achieve a VOCs removal ratio up to 99.99% by solar distillation under 1 sun.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are widely spread in the natural hydrological cycle, contaminating potential water sources, and leading to unexpected ecological hazards. However, water&#8208;purification technologies toward VOCs are energy&#8208;intensive and present unsatisfactory purity of the obtained water. The fundamental challenge is to differentiate the motion of water and VOC molecules by separators. Here, the concept of a super water&#8208;extracting gel (SWEG) for VOC&#8208;management and water purification via direct solar distillation is proposed. The strong hydrogen bonding effect in the hypercrosslinked hydrophilic polymeric networks enables the SWEG to extract water from VOC&#8208;containing water, which rejects the VOC solutes while allowing water through for interfacial evaporation. The obtained SWEG achieves a VOCs removal ratio up to 99.99% by solar distillation under 1 sun. A solar water&#8208;purification system is also demonstrated to produce clean water, which surpasses other competitive technologies based on electricity.

Patterned surfaces can enhance the sensitivity of laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry by segregating and concentrating analytes, but their fabrication can be challenging. A simple method to fabricate substrates patterned with micrometer&#8208;scale wells that yield more accurate and sensitive mass spectrometry measurements compared to a flat surface or cylindrical wells is presented. The wells can also concentrate and localize cells and beads for cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>A Solution&#8208;Processed Inorganic Emitter with High Spectral Selectivity for Efficient Subambient Radiative Cooling in Hot Humid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different emissive behaviors between a bulk film and particles in reststrahlen band are utilized and an emitter with excellent spectrum selectivity is achieved. This emitter successfully realizes good subambient cooling in hot and humid conditions, which is always a challenge for radiative cooling. The all&#8208;inorganic components and solution&#8208;based fabrication process render it durable and scalable simultaneously.








Abstract
Daytime radiative cooling provides an eco&#8208;friendly solution to space cooling with zero energy consumption. Despite significant advances, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative coolers show broadband infrared emission with low spectral selectivity, which limits their cooling temperatures, especially in hot humid regions. Here, an all&#8208;inorganic narrowband emitter comprising a solution&#8208;derived SiOxNy layer sandwiched between a reflective substrate and a self&#8208;assembly monolayer of SiO2 microspheres is reported. It shows a high and diffusive solar reflectance (96.4%) and strong infrared&#8208;selective emittance (94.6%) with superior spectral selectivity (1.46). Remarkable subambient cooling of up to 5&#160;&#176;C in autumn and 2.5&#160;&#176;C in summer are achieved under high humidity without any solar shading or convection cover at noontime in a subtropical coastal city, Hong Kong. Owing to the all&#8208;inorganic hydrophobic structure, the emitter shows outstanding resistance to ultraviolet and water in long&#8208;term durability tests. The scalable&#8208;solution&#8208;based fabrication renders this stable high&#8208;performance emitter promising for large&#8208;scale deployment in various climates.

         <title>Optical Rashba Effect in a Light&#8208;Emitting Perovskite Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical Rashba effect in active halide perovskite metasurfaces with broken in&#8208;plane inversion symmetry, which allows generation, routing, and enhancement of chiral photoluminescence, is demonstrated. A degree of circular polarization of 60% at room temperature and a sixfold enhancement of photoluminescence intensity are experimentally achieved.








Abstract
The Rashba effect, i.e., the splitting of electronic spin&#8208;polarized bands in the momentum space of a crystal with broken inversion symmetry, has enabled the realization of spin&#8208;orbitronic devices, in which spins are manipulated by spin&#8211;orbit coupling. In optics, where the helicity of light polarization represents the spin degree of freedom for spin&#8211;momentum coupling, the optical Rashba effect is manifested by the splitting of optical states with opposite chirality in the momentum space. Previous realizations of the optical Rashba effect relied on passive devices determining the surface plasmon or light propagation inside nanostructures, or the directional emission of chiral luminescence when hybridized with light&#8208;emitting media. An active device underpinned by the optical Rashba effect is demonstrated here, in which a monolithic halide perovskite metasurface emits highly directional chiral photoluminescence. An all&#8208;dielectric metasurface design with broken in&#8208;plane inversion symmetry is directly embossed into the high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index, light&#8208;emitting perovskite film, yielding a degree of circular polarization of photoluminescence of 60% at room temperature.

&lt;p&gt;The optical Rashba effect in active halide perovskite metasurfaces with broken in-plane inversion symmetry, which allows generation, routing, and enhancement of chiral photoluminescence, is demonstrated. A degree of circular polarization of 60% at room temperature and a sixfold enhancement of photoluminescence intensity are experimentally achieved.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Robust 120&#160;keV Hard X&#8208;Ray Imaging Detector based on Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn Single Crystals</title>

The CsPbBr2.9I0.1 (I0.1) detector shows the no&#8208;drift dark current and a record sensitivity of 6.3 &#215; 104&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#160;keV high&#8208;energy hard X&#8208;rays under a 5000&#160;V cm&#8722;1 electric field due to the suppressed ion migration. Moreover, clear X&#8208;ray imaging of the &#8220;pork rib&#8221; is realized using the I0.1 planar array detector under 120&#160;keV X&#8208;ray irradiation.








Abstract
The relatively low resistivity and severe ion migration in CsPbBr3 significantly degrade the performance of X&#8208;ray detectors due to their high detection limit and current drift. The electrical properties and X&#8208;ray detection performances of CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals are investigated by doping the iodine atoms into the melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3. The resistivity of CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals increases from 3.6 &#215; 109 (CsPbBr3) to 2.2 &#215; 1011 (CsPbBr2I) &#937; cm, restraining the leak current and decreasing the detection limit of the detector. Additionally, CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals exhibit stable dark currents, arising from their high ion migration activation energy. A record sensitivity of 6.3 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (CsPbBr2.9I0.1) and a low detection limit of 54 nGy s&#8722;1 (CsPbBr2I) are achieved by CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals for the 120 keV hard X&#8208;ray detection under a 5000 V cm&#8722;1 electrical field. The CsPbBr2.9I0.1 detector shows a stable current response with a dark current density of 0.58 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 for 30 days and clear imaging for 120 keV Xrays at ambient conditions. The effective iodine atom doping strategy makes the CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals promising for reproducible high&#8208;energy hard X&#8208;ray imaging systems.

         <title>Neisseria meningitidis Opca Protein/MnO2 Hybrid Nanoparticles for Overcoming the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier to Treat Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By loading the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate in hollow manganese dioxide nanoparticles with surface modification of Opca protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a bionic nanotherapeutic system is constructed to effectively overcome the blood&#8211;brain barrier for improved glioblastoma therapy.








Abstract
The major hurdle in glioblastoma therapy is the low efficacy of drugs crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Neisseria meningitidis is known to specifically enrich in the central nervous system through the guidance of an outer membrane invasion protein named Opca. Here, by loading a chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) in hollow manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles with surface modification of the Opca protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a bionic nanotherapeutic system (MTX@MnO2&#8208;Opca) is demonstrated to effectively overcome the BBB. The presence of the Opca protein enables the drug to cross the BBB and penetrate into tumor tissues. After accumulating in glioblastoma, the nanotherapeutic system catalyzes the decomposition of excess H2O2 in the tumor tissue and thereby generates O2, which alleviates tumor hypoxia and enhances the effect of chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. This bionic nanotherapeutic system may exhibit great potential in the treatment of glioblastoma.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Synthesis of Ultrathin, Flexible, and Transparent Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Thin Films via a Microfluidic&#8208;Based Solution Shearing Process</title>

         <dc:description>
A microfluidic&#8208;assisted solution shearing combined with post&#8208;synthetic rapid crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process is introduced, which enables the formation of high&#8208;quality conductive Ni3(HITP)2 thin&#8208;films with thickness controllability down to 10 nm in a rapid large&#8208;area scalable manner. This process can fabricate flexible and transparent Ni3(HITP)2 thin film for high&#8208;performance wearable gas sensors.








Abstract
Iminosemiquinone&#8208;linker&#8208;based conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted much attention as next&#8208;generation electronic materials due to their high electrical conductivity combined with high porosity. However, the utility of such c&#8208;MOFs in high&#8208;performance devices has been limited to date by the lack of high&#8208;quality MOF thin&#8208;film processing. Herein, a technique known as the microfluidic&#8208;assisted solution shearing combined with post&#8208;synthetic rapid crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process is introduced to generate a high&#8208;quality, flexible, and transparent thin&#8208;film of Ni3(hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) uniformly over a large&#8208;area in a high&#8208;throughput manner with thickness controllability down to tens of nanometers. The MASS&#8208;PRC process utilizes: 1) a micromixer&#8208;embedded blade to simultaneously mix and continuously supply the metal&#8211;ligand solution toward the drying front during solution shearing to generate an amorphous thin&#8208;film, followed by: 2) immersion in amine solution for rapid directional crystal growth. The as&#8208;synthesized c&#8208;MOF film has transparency of up to 88.8% and conductivity as high as 37.1 S cm&#8722;1. The high uniformity in conductivity is confirmed over a 3500 mm2 area with an arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) of 4.78&#160;nm. The flexible thin&#8208;film demonstrates the highest level of transparency for Ni3(HITP)2 and the highest hydrogen sulfide (H2S) sensing performance (2,085% at 5&#160;ppm) among c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based H2S sensors, enabling wearable gas&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>A Biocompatible Vibration&#8208;Actuated Omni&#8208;Droplets Rectifier with Large Volume Range Fabricated by Femtosecond Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vibration&#8208;actuated omni&#8208;droplets rectifier composed of an array of slippery ratchets is developed for manipulation of droplets with a large volume range in a compatible manner, which can achieve a fast, real&#8208;time, and robust transport of droplets in various modes, including transport of liquid slugs in tubes, programmable and sequential transport, and bidirectional transport, which demonstrates the great potential in biomedical detection and analysis.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance droplet transport is crucial for diverse applications including biomedical detection, chemical micro&#8208;reaction, and droplet microfluidics. Despite extensive progress, traditional passive and active strategies are restricted to limited liquid types, small droplet volume ranges, and poor biocompatibilities. Moreover, more challenges occur for biological fluids due to large viscosity and low surface tension. Here, a vibration&#8208;actuated omni&#8208;droplets rectifier (VAODR) consisting of slippery ratchet arrays fabricated by femtosecond laser and vibration platforms is reported. Through the relative competition between the asymmetric adhesive resistance originating from the lubricant meniscus on the VAODR and the periodic inertial driving force originating from isotropic vibration, the fast (up to &#8776;60&#160;mm s&#8722;1), programmable, and robust transport of droplets is achieved for a large volume range (0.05&#8211;2000&#160;&#181;L, Vmax/Vmin&#160;&#8776; 40&#8239;000) and in various transport modes including transport of liquid slugs in tubes, programmable and sequential transport, and bidirectional transport. This VAODR is general to a high diversity of biological and medical fluids, and thus can be used for biomedical detection including ABO blood&#8208;group tests and anticancer drugs screening. These strategies provide a complementary and promising platform for maneuvering omni&#8208;droplets that are fundamental to biomedical applications and other high&#8208;throughput omni&#8208;droplet operation fields.

         <title>Mechanically Guided Hierarchical Assembly of 3D Mesostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of multiple layers of independently prestretched elastomeric substrates in mechanically guided 3D assembly provides access to complex hierarchical 3D architectures that were&#160;previously inaccessible, including vertically aligned helices and fully closed 3D cages. These hierarchical assembly concepts create possibilities for a broad range of fields from microrobotics and reconfigurable metamaterials to bio&#8208;integrated electronics.








Abstract
3D, hierarchical micro/nanostructures formed with advanced functional materials are of growing interest due to their broad potential utility in electronics, robotics, battery technology, and biomedical engineering. Among various strategies in 3D micro/nanofabrication, a set of methods based on compressive buckling offers wide&#8208;ranging material compatibility, fabrication scalability, and precise process control. Previously reports on this type of approach rely on a single, planar prestretched elastomeric platform to transform thin&#8208;film precursors with 2D layouts into 3D architectures. The simple planar configuration of bonding sites between these precursors and their assembly substrates prevents the realization of certain types of complex 3D geometries. In this paper, a set of hierarchical assembly concepts is reported that leverage multiple layers of prestretched elastomeric substrates to induce not only compressive buckling of 2D precursors bonded to them but also of themselves, thereby creating 3D mesostructures mounted at multiple levels of 3D frameworks with complex, elaborate configurations. Control over strains used in these processes provides reversible access to multiple different 3D layouts in a given structure. Examples to demonstrate these ideas through both experimental and computational results span vertically aligned helices to closed 3D cages, selected for their relevance to 3D conformal bio&#8208;interfaces and multifunctional microsystems.

         <title>Assembling Diverse Skyrmionic Phases in Fe3GeTe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic effective Hamiltonians with spin invariants, which are all the possible interaction forms allowed by symmetry, are built by a new and general developed method. Application of this method to 2D magnet Fe3GeTe2 leads to discovery of diverse skyrmionic phases, with their origins being determined to be multiple fourth order interactions with novel expressions.








Abstract
Skyrmionic magnetic states are promising in advanced spintronics. This topic is experiencing recent progress in 2D magnets, with, for example, a near 300 K Curie temperature observed in Fe3GeTe2. However, despite previous studies reporting skyrmions in Fe3GeTe2, such a system remains elusive, since it has been reported to host either N&#233;el&#8208;type or Bloch&#8208;type textures, while a net Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) cannot occur in this compound for symmetry reasons. It is thus desirable to develop an accurate model to deeply understand Fe3GeTe2. Here, a newly developed method adopting spin invariants is applied to build a first&#8208;principle&#8208;based Hamiltonian, which predicts colorful topological defects assembled from the unit of Bloch lines, and reveals the critical role of specific forms of fourth&#8208;order interactions in Fe3GeTe2. Rather than the DMI, it is the multiple fourth&#8208;order interactions, with symmetry and spin&#8211;orbit couplings considered, that stabilize both N&#233;el&#8208;type and Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions, as well as antiskyrmions, without any preference for clockwise versus counterclockwise spin rotation. This study also demonstrates that spin invariants can be used as a general approach to study complex magnetic interactions.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Engineered Nanodecoys for the Multi&#8208;Target Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;engineered nanodecoys (NDs) based on programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208;expressing macrophage membrane (PRM) are developed for the multi&#8208;target management of autoimmune diseases. PRM NDs scavenge multiple pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and meanwhile reconstruct the programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory axis to inhibit CD4+ T cell activation and restore immune tolerance, which cooperatively reverses the immune&#8208;activation and interrupt the self&#8208;amplified inflammatory cascades.








Abstract
Overactivated T cells and overproduced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines form a self&#8208;amplified signaling loop to continuously exacerbate the dysregulated inflammatory response and propel the progression of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). Herein, immuno&#8208;engineered nanodecoys (NDs) based on poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles coated with programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208;expressing macrophage membrane (PRM) are developed to mediate multi&#8208;target interruption of the self&#8208;promoted inflammatory cascade in AIDs. The PRM collected from IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;treated RAW 264.7 cells possesses elevated surface levels of adhesion molecule receptors and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine receptors, and, thus, systemically administered PRM NDs afford higher accumulation level in inflamed tissues and stronger scavenging efficiency toward multiple pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. More importantly, IFN&#8208;&#947; treatment induces remarkable PD&#8208;L1 expression on PRM, thereby allowing PRM NDs to bind membrane&#8208;bound programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) on CD4+ T cell surfaces or neutralize free soluble PD&#8208;1, which reconstructs the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory axis to suppress CD4+ T cell activation and restore immune tolerance. As such, PRM NDs provoke potent and cooperative anti&#8208;inflammatory and immune&#8208;suppressive efficacies to alleviate autoimmune damages in Zymosan A&#8208;induced arthritis mice and dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis mice. This study provides an enlightened example for the immuno&#8208;engineering of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;based NDs, rendering promising implications into the treatment of AIDs via multi&#8208;target immune&#8208;modulation.

         <dc:description>
A fast and scalable electrophoretic&#8208;deposition&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly technique of photonic cellulose nanocrystal films, that can circumvent the long process evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA), is developed. Iridescent films with tunable color can be achieved in a few minutes by simple adjustment of the suspension properties. Co&#8208;assembly with plasmonic metal nanoparticles can be performed in one step with no addition of reducing agent.








Abstract
Nano&#8208;enabled, bio&#8208;based, functional materials are key for the transition to a sustainable society as they can be used, owing to both their performance and nontoxicity, to gradually replace existing nonrenewable engineering materials. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), produced by acid hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass, have been shown to possess distinct self&#8208;assembly, optical, and electromechanical properties, and are anticipated to play an important role in the fabrication of photonic, optoelectronic, and functional hybrid materials. To facilitate CNCs&#8217; technological viability, a method suitable for industrial exploitation is developed to produce photonic films possessing long&#8208;range chirality on conductive, rigid, or flexible, substrates within a few minutes. The approach is based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD)&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of CNCs, where photonic films of any size can be produced by controlling CNC surface properties and EPD parameters. CNC film coloration can be determined by the CNC aqueous suspension characteristics, while their reflected intensity can be tuned by changing the duration and number of electrodeposition cycles. EPD&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of CNCs is compatible with in situ reduction of gold precursors without the need to use additional reducing agents (some of which are considered toxic), thereby allowing the preparation of hybrid photonic films with tunable plasmonic response in a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Anisotropic Rod&#8208;Shaped Particles Influence Injectable Granular Hydrogel Properties and Cell Invasion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical and rod&#8208;shaped microparticles are fabricated using droplet microfluidics and assembled into injectable and porous granular hydrogels for tissue repair. Changing particle shape improves structural features such as pore anisotropy and increases bulk mechanics such as storage moduli. Hydrogels containing rod&#8208;shaped particles support robust endothelial cell sprouting in&#160;vitro and uninhibited cell invasion in vivo.








Abstract
Granular hydrogels have emerged as a new class of injectable and porous biomaterials that improve integration with host tissue when compared to solid hydrogels. Granular hydrogels are typically prepared using spherical particles and this study considers whether particle shape (i.e., isotropic spheres vs anisotropic rods) influences granular hydrogel properties and cellular invasion. Simulations predict that anisotropic rods influence pore shape and interconnectivity, as well as bead transport through granular assemblies. Photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable norbornene&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid is used to produce spherical and rod&#8208;shaped particles using microfluidic droplet generators and formed into shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing granular hydrogels, with particle shape influencing mechanics and injectability. Rod&#8208;shaped particles form granular hydrogels that have anisotropic and interconnected pores, with pore size and number influenced by particle shape and degree of packing. Robust in&#160;vitro sprouting of endothelial cells from embedded cellular spheroids is observed with rod&#8208;shaped particles, including higher sprouting densities and sprout lengths when compared to hydrogels with spherical particles. Cell and vessel invasion into granular hydrogels when injected subcutaneously in vivo are significantly greater with rod&#8208;shaped particles, whereas a gradient of cellularity is observed with spherical particles. Overall, this work demonstrates potentially superior functional properties of granular hydrogels with rod&#8208;shaped particles for tissue repair.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode with Reinforced Electrochemical Performance Enabled by Convertible Amorphous Li2CO3 Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;nickel cathode (Ni&#160;&#8805;&#160;90%) is developed through controlling the surface residual lithium composition with a formed amorphous Li2CO3 protective layer. This cathode can resist corrosion by air, and will be converted into a stable cathode electrolyte interphase during the electrochemical process, resulting in enhanced storage performance and extended cycle life for high&#8208;nickel cathodes.








Abstract
High&#8208;nickel (Ni &#8805; 90%) cathodes with high specific capacity hold great potential for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical application is restricted by the high interfacial reactivity under continuous air erosion and electrolyte assault. Herein, a stable high&#8208;nickel cathode is rationally designed via in situ induction of a dense amorphous Li2CO3 on the particle surface by a preemptive atmosphere control. Among the residual lithium compounds, Li2CO3 is the most thermodynamically stable one, so a dense Li2CO3 coating layer can serve as a physical protection layer to isolate the cathode from contact with moist air. Furthermore, amorphous Li2CO3 can be transformed into a robust F&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) during cycling, which reinforces the cathode's interfacial stability and improves the electrochemical performance. The assembled coin cell with this modified cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 232.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 with a superior initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 95.1%, and considerable capacity retention of 90.4% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, no slurry gelation occurs during the large&#8208;scale electrode fabrication process. This work opens a valuable perspective on the evolution of amorphous Li2CO3 in LIBs and provides guidance on protecting unstable high&#8208;capacity cathodes for energy&#8208;storage devices.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2107696, Il&#8208;Doo Kim, Steve Park, and co&#8208;workers introduce a microfluidic&#8208;based solution shearing combined with post&#8208;synthetic rapid crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process, which enables the formation of high&#8208;quality conductive, flexible and transparent Ni3(HITP)2 films with thickness controllability down to 10 nm in a rapid large&#8208;area scalable manner. They fabricate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas sensors using the film, which can detect the target gas under humid conditions, and exhibit the highest sensing performance to date.

Abate and co&#8208;workers introduce a simple method to pattern substrates with micrometer&#8208;scale wells yielding more&#8208;sensitive mass spectrometry measurements compared to flat&#8208;surface or cylindrical wells. The wells also concentrate and localize cells and beads for cell&#8208;based assays.

Spintronics
There has long been interest in exploiting the excellent spin coherence in graphene for applications in spintronics. In article 2105023, Keke He, Jonathan P. Bird, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate robust spin conduction in graphene, well beyond room temperature. This enhanced performance derives from pronounced spin&#8211;orbit coupling, introduced when a chromia substrate is used to break the natural symmetry of the carbon lattice.

Vaccines have been a major focus of the global SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 response. Advanced materials have played a role in enabling the current generation of effective vaccines that have been deployed, and also they have shown promise in next&#8208;generation vaccines that are being developed in response to the pandemic.








Abstract
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), has killed untold millions worldwide and has hurtled vaccines into the spotlight as a go&#8208;to approach to mitigate it. Advances in virology, genomics, structural biology, and vaccine technologies have enabled a rapid and unprecedented rollout of COVID&#8208;19 vaccines, although much of the developing world remains unvaccinated. Several new vaccine platforms have been developed or deployed against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, with most targeting the large viral Spike immunogen. Those that safely induce strong and durable antibody responses at low dosages are advantageous, as well are those that can be rapidly produced at a large scale. Virtually all COVID&#8208;19 vaccines and adjuvants possess nanoscale or microscale dimensions and represent diverse and unique biomaterials. Viral vector vaccine platforms, lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and multimeric display technologies for subunit vaccines have received much attention. Nanoscale vaccine adjuvants have also been used in combination with other vaccines. To deal with the ongoing pandemic, and to be ready for potential future ones, advanced vaccine technologies will continue to be developed in the near future. Herein, the recent use of advanced materials used for developing COVID&#8208;19 vaccines is summarized.

         <title>Programmable Matter: The Nanoparticle Atom and DNA Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable atom equivalents (PAEs) are nanoparticles functionalized with a dense shell of DNA containing short single&#8208;stranded regions called &#8220;sticky ends.&#8221; When PAEs with complementary sticky ends interact, hybridization leads to DNA &#8220;bonds&#8221; between nanoparticles. PAEs can be assembled into crystalline arrangements where unlike atomic systems, the &#8220;atom&#8221; (nanoparticle) and &#8220;bond&#8221; (DNA) can be tuned independently to yield designer materials.








Abstract
Colloidal crystal engineering with DNA has led to significant advances in bottom&#8208;up materials synthesis and a new way of thinking about fundamental concepts in chemistry. Here, programmable atom equivalents (PAEs), comprised of nanoparticles (the &#8220;atoms&#8221;) functionalized with DNA (the &#8220;bonding elements&#8221;), are assembled through DNA hybridization into crystalline lattices. Unlike atomic systems, the &#8220;atom&#8221; (e.g., the nanoparticle shape, size, and composition) and the &#8220;bond&#8221; (e.g., the DNA length and sequence) can be tuned independently, yielding designer materials with unique catalytic, optical, and biological properties. In this review, nearly three decades of work that have contributed to the evolution of this class of programmable matter is chronicled, starting from the earliest examples based on gold&#8208;core PAEs, and then delineating how advances in synthetic capabilities, DNA design, and fundamental understanding of PAE&#8208;PAE interactions have led to new classes of functional materials that, in several cases, have no natural equivalent.

         <title>Bioinks and Bioprinting Strategies for Skeletal Muscle Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 12, March 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benefits of 3D bioprinting technologies for skeletal muscle tissue engineering are highlighted. Skeletal muscle physiology, muscle regeneration following injury, and current treatments are discussed. Subsequently, bioprinting strategies implemented for muscle tissue engineering are critically reviewed. Recent advances in bioinks and bioprinting strategies to construct large tissues, boost myogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and enhance integration are discussed.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles play important roles in critical body functions and their injury or disease can lead to limitation of mobility and loss of independence. Current treatments result in variable functional recovery, while reconstructive surgery, as the gold&#8208;standard approach, is limited due to donor shortage, donor&#8208;site morbidity, and limited functional recovery. Skeletal muscle tissue engineering (SMTE) has generated enthusiasm as an alternative solution for treatment of injured tissue and serves as a functional disease model. Recently, bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for recapitulating the complex and highly organized architecture of skeletal muscles at clinically relevant sizes. Here, skeletal muscle physiology, muscle regeneration following injury, and current treatments following muscle loss are discussed, and then bioprinting strategies implemented for SMTE are critically reviewed. Subsequently, recent advancements that have led to improvement of bioprinting strategies to construct large muscle structures, boost myogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and enhance tissue integration are discussed. Bioinks for muscle bioprinting, as an essential part of any bioprinting strategy, are discussed, and their benefits, limitations, and areas to be improved are highlighted. Finally, the directions the field should expand to make bioprinting strategies more translational and overcome the clinical unmet needs are discussed.

         <title>Quantum sensing and imaging of spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven spin dynamics in noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn</title>

Abstract
Novel noncollinear antiferromagnets with spontaneous time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking, nontrivial band topology, and unconventional transport properties have received immense research interest over the past decade due to their rich physics and enormous promise in technological applications. One of the central focuses in this emerging field is exploring the relationship between the microscopic magnetic structure and exotic material properties. Here, the nanoscale imaging of both spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;induced deterministic magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers is reported. Direct evidence of the off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8208;dipole coupling between the spin dynamics in Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also demonstrated with NV relaxometry measurements. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of NV centers in accessing the local information of the magnetic order and dynamics in these emergent quantum materials and suggest new opportunities for investigating the interplay between topology and magnetism in a broad range of topological magnets.

         <title>Bioinspired, Omnidirectional, and Hypersensitive Flexible Strain Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the ultrasensitive and omnidirectional sensing function of scorpions to weak vibration signals, the biological mechanism is explored and a flexible strain sensor inspired by the slit sensillum embedded on the walking legs of scorpions is fabricated. Results demonstrate that the sensors also have hypersensitive, omnidirectional sensing, and direction discrimination to vibration stimuli, similar to that of scorpions.








Abstract
Sensors are widely used in various fields, among which flexible strain sensors that can sense minuscule mechanical signals and are easy to adapt to many irregular surfaces are attractive for structure health monitoring, early detection, and failure prevention in humans, machines, or buildings. In practical applications, subtle and abnormal vibrations generated from any direction are highly desired to detect and even orientate their directions initially to eliminate potential hazards. However, it is challenging for flexible strain sensors to achieve hypersensitivity and omnidirectionality simultaneously due to the restrictions of many materials with anisotropic mechanical/electrical properties and some micro/nanostructures they employed. Herein, it is revealed that the vision&#8208;degraded scorpion detects subtle vibrations spatially and omnidirectionally using a slit sensillum with fan&#8208;shaped grooves. A bioinspired flexible strain sensor consisting of curved microgrooves arranged around a central circle is devised, exhibiting an unprecedented gauge factor of over 18&#160;000 and stability over 7000 cycles. It can sense and recognize vibrations of diverse input waveforms at different locations, bouncing behaviors of a free&#8208;falling bead, and human wrist pulses regardless of sensor installation angles. The geometric designs can be translated to other material systems for potential applications including human health monitoring and engineering failure detection.

         <title>Light Emission of Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons in Inorganic Metal Halides for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) have recently attracted tremendous interest due to their broadband emission, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and self&#8208;absorption&#8208;free properties, which enable a large range of optoelectronic applications such as lighting, displays, radiation detection, and special sensors. Unlike free excitons (FEs), the formation of STEs requires strong coupling between excited state excitons and soft lattice in low electronic dimensional materials. The chemical and structural diversity of metal halides provides an ideal platform for developing efficient STE emission materials. Herein, we present an overview of recent progress on the STE emission materials for optoelectronic applications. The relationships between fundamental emission mechanisms, chemical compositions, and device performances are systematically reviewed. On this basis, we present currently existing challenges and possible development opportunities in this field

         <title>Printed Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectrics turns wasted heat energy into useful electrical energy. Current commercial manufacturing techniques are time and energy intensive, contributing to low utilization of thermoelectrics. This review explores how printing has been used to make thermoelectric materials and generators, and how advances in the last five years hold great promise for printing to become the dominant future manufacturing technique for thermoelectrics.








Abstract
The looming impact of climate change and the diminishing supply of fossil fuels both highlight the need for a transition to more sustainable energy sources. While solar and wind can produce much of the energy needed, to meet all our energy demands there is a need for a diverse sustainable energy generation mix. Thermoelectrics can play a vital role in this, by harvesting otherwise wasted heat energy and converting it into useful electrical energy. While efficient thermoelectric materials have been known since the 1950s, thermoelectrics have not been utilized beyond a few niche applications. This can in part be attributed to the high cost of manufacturing and the geometrical restraints of current commercial manufacturing techniques. Printing offers a potential route to manufacture thermoelectric materials at a lower price point and allows for the fabrication of generators that are custom built to meet the waste heat source requirements.

&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectrics turns wasted heat energy into useful electrical energy. Current commercial manufacturing techniques are time and energy intensive, contributing to low utilization of thermoelectrics. This review explores how printing has been used to make thermoelectric materials and generators, and how advances in the last five years hold great promise for printing to become the dominant future manufacturing technique for thermoelectrics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The looming impact of climate change and the diminishing supply of fossil fuels both highlight the need for a transition to more sustainable energy sources. While solar and wind can produce much of the energy needed, to meet all our energy demands there is a need for a diverse sustainable energy generation mix. Thermoelectrics can play a vital role in this, by harvesting otherwise wasted heat energy and converting it into useful electrical energy. While efficient thermoelectric materials have been known since the 1950s, thermoelectrics have not been utilized beyond a few niche applications. This can in part be attributed to the high cost of manufacturing and the geometrical restraints of current commercial manufacturing techniques. Printing offers a potential route to manufacture thermoelectric materials at a lower price point and allows for the fabrication of generators that are custom built to meet the waste heat source requirements. This review details the significant progress that has been made in recent years in printing of thermoelectric materials in all thermoelectric material groups and printing methods, and highlights very recent publications that show printing can now offer comparable performance to commercially manufactured thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nano&#8208;memristors with 4mV&#160;Switching Voltage Based On Surface&#8208;modified Copper Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of memristors operating at low switching voltages &lt;50&#160;mV&#160;could be very useful to avoid signal amplification in many types of circuits, such as those used in bioelectronic applications to interact with neurons and nerves. Here we report that 400&#8208;nm&#8208;thick films made of dalkyl&#8208;dithiophosphoric (DDP) modified copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) exhibit volatile threshold&#8208;type resistive switching (RS) at ultra&#8208;low switching voltage of &#8764;4&#160;mV. The RS has been observed in small nanocells with a lateral size of &lt;50&#160;nm2,&#160;during hundreds of cycles, and with an ultra&#8208;low variability. Atomistic calculations reveal that the switching mechanism is related to the modification of the Schottky barriers and insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition when ionic movement is induced via external bias. We also use the devices to model integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire neurons for spiking neural networks, and conclude that circuits employing DDP&#8208;CuNPs consume around 10 times less power than similar neurons implemented with a memristor that switches at 40&#160;mV.

         <title>Synergic Reaction Kinetics over Adjacent Ruthenium Sites for Superb Hydrogen Generation in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based electrocatalysts as platinum (Pt) alternatives in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are promising. However; achieving efficient reaction processes on Ru catalysts is still challenging; especially in alkaline media. Here; the well&#8208;dispersed Ru nanoparticles with adjacent Ru single atoms on carbon substrate (Ru1,n&#8208;NC) is demonstrated to be a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The obtained Ru1,n&#8208;NC exhibits ultralow overpotential (14.8&#160;mV) and high turnover frequency (1.25 H2 s&#8211;1 at &#8208;0.025&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode); much better than the commercial 40 wt% Pt/C. Our analyses reveal that Ru nanoparticles and single sites can promote each other to deliver electrons to the carbon substrate. Eventually; the electronic regulations bring accelerated water dissociation and reduced energy barriers of hydroxide/hydrogen desorption on adjacent Ru sites; then an optimized reaction kinetics for Ru1,n&#8208;NC is obtained to achieve superb hydrogen generation in alkaline media. This work provides a new insight into the catalyst design in simultaneous optimizations of the elementary steps to obtain ideal HER performance in alkaline media.

         <title>Bioinspired Tough Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Flexible Ultralong&#8208;Life Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>

Abstract
Manufacturing advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for flexible rechargeable batteries becomes increasingly important but remains grand challenge. The sophisticated structure of robust animal dermis and good water&#8208;retention of plant cell in nature provide archetypes and grant germane inspirations for the design of high&#8208;performance SSEs. Herein, tough bioinspired SSEs with intrinsic hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) conduction are constructed by in&#8208;situ formation of OH&#8722; conductive ionomer network within a hollow&#8208;polymeric&#8208;microcapsule&#8208; decorated hydrogel polymer network. By virtue of the bioinspired design and dynamic dual&#8208;penetrating network structure with the synergism of ionomer and molecular polymer, the bioinspired SSEs simultaneously obtain mechanical robustness with 1800% stretchability, good water uptake of 107&#160;g/g and water retention, and superhigh ion conductivity of 215 mS/cm. The nanostructure of bioinspired SSE and related ion&#8208;conduction mechanism are revealed and visualized by molecular dynamics simulation, where plenty of compact and superfast ion&#8208;transport channels are constructed, contributing to superhigh ion conductivity. As a result, the flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with bioinspired SSEs witness high power density of 148 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2, specific capacity of 758 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 and ultralong cycling stability of 320 hours as well as outstanding flexibility. The bioinspired methodology and deep insight of ion&#8208;conduction mechanism will shed light on the design of advanced nanostructured SSEs for flexible energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>A Vinylene&#8208;Linker&#8208;Based Polymer Acceptor Featuring Co&#8208;planar and Rigid Molecular Conformation Enables High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;art Y&#8208;series polymer acceptors are typically based on a mono&#8208;thiophene linker, which could cause some twisted molecular conformations and thus limit the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). In this paper, we report, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance polymer acceptor based on vinylene linkers, which lead to surprising changes in the polymers&#8217; molecular conformations, optoelectronic properties and enhanced photovoltaic performance. We find that the polymer acceptors based on thiophene or bithiophene linkers (PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947; &amp; PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;) display significant molecular twisting between end&#8208;groups and linker units, while the vinylene&#8208;based polymer (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) exhibits a more co&#8208;planar and rigid molecular conformation. As a result, PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947; demonstrates a better conjugation and tighter interchain stacking, which results in higher mobility and a reduced energetic disorder. Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations revealed that the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based blend exhibited a high domain purity and thus a better fill factor in its all&#8208;PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1% was achieved in PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all&#8208;PSCs to date. This work demonstrates that vinylene&#8208;linker is a superior unit to build polymer acceptors with more co&#8208;planar and rigid chain conformation that is beneficial for polymer aggregation and efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Highly Effective Stroke Therapy Enabled by Genetically Engineered Viral Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stroke results in the formation of a cavity in the infarcted brain tissue. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis are poor in the cavity, preventing brain tissue regeneration for stroke therapy. To regenerate brain tissue in the cavity, we genetically engineered filamentous phages, the human&#8208;safe nanofiber&#8208;like bacteria&#8208;specific viruses, to display many copies of RGD peptide on the sidewalls. The viral nanofibers, electrostatically coated on the biocompatible injectable silk protein microparticles, not only promoted the adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of neural stem cells (NSCs), but also induced NSCs to differentiate preferentially into neurons in basal medium within 3 days. After the NSC&#8208;loaded microparticles were injected into the stroke cavity of rat models, the phage nanofibers on the microparticles stimulated angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the stroke sites within 2 weeks for brain regeneration, leading to functional recovery of limb motor control of rats within 12 weeks. The viral nanofibers also brought about the desired outcomes for stroke therapy, such as reducing inflammatory response, decreasing thickness of astrocytes scars, and increasing neuroblasts response in the subventricular zone. Since virtually any functional peptide can be displayed on the phage by genetic means, the phage nanofibers hold promise as a unique and effective injectable biomaterial for stroke therapy.

To regenerate brain tissue in the cavity, we genetically engineered filamentous phages, the human-safe nanofiber-like bacteria-specific viruses, to display many copies of RGD peptide on the sidewalls. The viral nanofibers, electrostatically coated on the biocompatible injectable silk protein microparticles, not only promoted the adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of neural stem cells (NSCs), but also induced NSCs to differentiate preferentially into neurons in basal medium within 3 days. After the NSC-loaded microparticles were injected into the stroke cavity of rat models, the phage nanofibers on the microparticles stimulated angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the stroke sites within 2 weeks for brain regeneration, leading to functional recovery of limb motor control of rats within 12 weeks. The viral nanofibers also brought about the desired outcomes for stroke therapy, such as reducing inflammatory response, decreasing thickness of astrocytes scars, and increasing neuroblasts response in the subventricular zone. Since virtually any functional peptide can be displayed on the phage by genetic means, the phage nanofibers hold promise as a unique and effective injectable biomaterial for stroke therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rapid surface display of mRNA antigens by bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles for a personalized tumor vaccine</title>

Abstract
Therapeutic mRNA vaccination is an attractive approach to trigger antitumor immunity. However, the mRNA delivery technology for customized tumor vaccine is still limited. Herein, we employed bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as an mRNA delivery platform by genetically engineering with surface decoration of RNA binding protein, L7Ae, and lysosomal escape protein, listeriolysin O (OMV&#8208;LL). OMV&#8208;LL can rapidly adsorb box C/D sequence&#8208;labelled mRNA antigens through L7Ae binding (OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA) and deliver them into dendritic cells (DCs), following by the cross&#8208;presentation via listeriolysin O&#8208;mediated endosomal escape. OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA significantly inhibited melanoma progression and elicited a 37.5% complete regression in colon cancer model. OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA induced a long&#8208;term immune memory and protected the mice from tumor challenge after 60 days. In summary, this platform provides a delivery technology distinct from lipid nanoparticles (LNP) for personalized mRNA tumor vaccination, and with a &#8220;Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Display&#8221; strategy that enables its versatile application in mRNA vaccines.

         <title>A readily scalable, clinically demonstrated, antibiofouling zwitterionic surface treatment for implantable medical devices</title>

Abstract
Nosocomial infections lead to increased hospital readmissions, post&#8208;operation complications, and often death. Many of these infections originate from the use of synthetic materials in the body to which proteins and microorganisms anchor. Unlike growth on tissue, the microbes can grow freely on implantable devices with minimal immune system intervention and often form resilient biofilms that continuously pump out pathogenic cells. The efficacy of antibiotics used to treat infection is declining due to increased rates of pathogenic resistance. We have developed a simple, one&#8208;step zwitterionic surface modification to significantly reduce protein and microbial adhesion to synthetic materials and demonstrate the successful modification of several clinically relevant materials, including recalcitrant materials such as elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The treated surfaces exhibit robust adhesion resistance against proteins and microorganisms in both static and flow conditions. Furthermore, the surface treatment completely prevents the adhesion of mammalian fibroblast cells while displaying no cytotoxicity. To demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the novel technology in the real&#8208;world, we have developed a surface&#8208;treated, commercial silicone foley catheter that was cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (K192034). 16 long&#8208;term catheterized patients received surface&#8208;treated catheters and completed a Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI&#8208;I) questionnaire. 10 out of 16 patients described their urinary tract condition post&#8208;implantation as &#8220;much better&#8221; or &#8220;very much better&#8221; and 72% (n = 13) of patients desired to continue using the surface&#8208;treated catheter over conventional latex or silicone catheters. We propose that this universal, readily scalable antibiofouling surface treatment will improve the safety of implantable devices by reducing patient complications, morbidity, and mortality in hospitals

         <title>A Direct Writing Approach for Organic Semiconductor Single&#8208;Crystal Patterns with Unique Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving purely orientated single&#8208;crystal patterns is significant but challenging for uniform and desirable performance in device integration. A direct writing approach is presented to purify the orientation through delicately manipulating the microscale meniscus. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, based on the crystal patterns with unique orientation, exhibit remarkable performance, revealing great potential in organic electronics.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor single&#8208;crystal (OSSC) patterns with precisely controlled orientation are of great significance to the integrated fabrication of devices with high and uniform performance. However, it is still challenging to achieve purely oriented OSSC patterns due to the complex nucleation and growth process of OSSCs. Here, a general direct writing approach is presented to readily obtain high&#8208;quality OSSC patterns with unique orientation. In specific, a direct writing method is demonstrated wherein the microscale meniscus is manipulated, which makes it possible to precisely control the nucleation and growth process of the OSSC because of its comparable size to the crystal nuclei. The resulting OSSC patterns are highly crystalline and purely oriented, in which each ribbon crystal shows a deviation angle of 33&#176; to the printing direction. The mechanism of orientation purification is revealed experimentally and theoretically, and the results show that the TCL deformation caused by the difference in wettability and adhesive force, as well as the asymmetry of fluid concentration distribution, are the key factors leading to the selective deposition and unique orientation. Moreover, organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors are prepared based on the OSSC patterns with unique orientation, which exhibit higher device performance compared to the non&#8208;purely oriented crystal&#8208;based OFETs.

         <title>Enhancing the Reversibility of Lattice Oxygen Redox Through Modulated Transition Metal&#8208;Oxygen Covalency for Layered Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Utilizing reversible lattice oxygen redox (OR) in battery electrodes is an essential strategy to overcome the capacity limitation set by conventional transition metal redox. However, lattice OR reactions are often accompanied with irreversible oxygen oxidation, leading to local structural transformations and voltage/capacity fading. Herein, we propose that the reversibility of lattice OR can be remarkably improved through modulating transition metal&#8208;oxygen covalency for layered electrode of Na&#8208;ion batteries. By developing a novel layered P2&#8208;Na0.6Mg0.15Mn0.7Cu0.15O2 electrode, we demonstrate that the highly electronegative Cu dopants could improve the lattice OR reversibility to 95% compared to 73% for Cu&#8208;free counterpart, as directly quantified through high&#8208;efficiency mapping of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering. Crucially, the large energetic overlap between Cu 3d and O 2p states dictates the rigidity of oxygen framework, which effectively mitigates the structural distortion of local oxygen environment upon (de)sodiation and leads to the enhanced lattice OR reversibility. The electrode also exhibits a completely solid&#8208;solution reaction with an ultralow volume change of only 0.45% and a reversible metal migration upon cycling, which together ensure the improved electrochemical performance. Our results emphasize the critical role of transition metal&#8208;oxygen covalency for enhancing the reversibility of lattice OR toward high&#8208;capacity electrodes employing OR chemistry.

         <title>Blocking Cancer&#8211;Nerve Crosstalk for Treatment of Metastatic Bone Cancer Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In metastatic bone tumors, nerve and cancer cells are interdependent. The crosstalk between them promotes tumor progression, causing severe cancer pain. In this work, Mg/Al layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide nanoshells are constructed with AZ&#8208;23 loaded inside and alendronate decorated outside, which can target into bone tumors to block the nerve&#8208;cancer crosstalk for effective inhibition of tumor growth and pain relief.








Abstract
The tumor microenvironment is a complex milieu where neurons constitute an important non&#8208;neoplastic cell type. From &#8220;cancer neuroscience,&#8221; the crosstalk between tumors and neurons favors the rapid growth of both, making the cancer&#8211;nerve interaction a reciprocally beneficial process. Thus, cancer&#8211;nerve crosstalk may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention against cancer and cancer&#8208;related symptoms. We&#160;proposed a nerve&#8211;cancer crosstalk blocking strategy for metastatic bone cancer pain treatment, achieved by Mg/Al layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide nanoshells (Mg/Al&#8208;LDH) with AZ&#8208;23 loaded inside and alendronate decorated outside. The pain&#8208;causing H+ is rapidly eliminated by the LDH, with neurogenesis inhibited by the antagonist AZ&#8208;23. As positive feedback, the decreased pain reverses the nerve&#8208;to&#8208;cancer Ca2+ crosstalk&#8208;related cell cycle, dramatically inhibiting tumor growth. All experiments confirm the improved pain threshold and enhanced tumor inhibition. The study may inspire multidisciplinary researchers to focus on cancer&#8211;nerve crosstalk for treating cancer and accompanied neuropathic diseases.

In this work, Mg/Al layered-double-hydroxide nanoshells are constructed with AZ-23 loaded inside and alendronate decorated outside, which can target into bone tumors to block the nerve-cancer crosstalk for effective inhibition of tumor growth and pain relief.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumor microenvironment is a complex milieu where neurons constitute an important non-neoplastic cell type. From &#8220;cancer neuroscience,&#8221; the crosstalk between tumors and neurons favors the rapid growth of both, making the cancer&#8211;nerve interaction a reciprocally beneficial process. Thus, cancer&#8211;nerve crosstalk may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention against cancer and cancer-related symptoms. We&#160;proposed a nerve&#8211;cancer crosstalk blocking strategy for metastatic bone cancer pain treatment, achieved by Mg/Al layered-double-hydroxide nanoshells (Mg/Al-LDH) with AZ-23 loaded inside and alendronate decorated outside. The pain-causing H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is rapidly eliminated by the LDH, with neurogenesis inhibited by the antagonist AZ-23. As positive feedback, the decreased pain reverses the nerve-to-cancer Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; crosstalk-related cell cycle, dramatically inhibiting tumor growth. All experiments confirm the improved pain threshold and enhanced tumor inhibition. The study may inspire multidisciplinary researchers to focus on cancer&#8211;nerve crosstalk for treating cancer and accompanied neuropathic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dative Epitaxy of Commensurate Monocrystalline Covalent van der Waals Moir&#233; Supercrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dative epitaxy represents the Goldilocks&#8217; principle of epitaxy: it takes advantage of dative bonding for fixing the atomic registry and crystal orientation, while ensuring the full flexibility of van der Waals epitaxy. The globally commensurate Cr5Te8/WSe2 moir&#233; supercrystal is distinctly different from conventional incommensurate moir&#233; superlattices or local commensurate domains.








Abstract
Realizing van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy in the 1980s represents a breakthrough that circumvents the stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements in conventional covalent heteroepitaxy. However, due to the weak vdW interactions, there is little control over film qualities by the substrate. Typically, discrete domains with a spread of misorientation angles are formed, limiting the applicability of vdW epitaxy. Here, the epitaxial growth of monocrystalline, covalent Cr5Te8 2D crystals on monolayer vdW WSe2 by chemical vapor deposition is reported, driven by interfacial dative bond formation. The lattice of Cr5Te8, with a lateral dimension of a few tens of micrometers, is fully commensurate with that of WSe2 via 3 &#215; 3 (Cr5Te8)/7 &#215; 7 (WSe2) supercell matching, forming a single&#8208;crystalline moir&#233; superlattice. This work establishes a conceptually distinct paradigm of thin&#8208;film epitaxy, termed &#8220;dative epitaxy&#8221;, which takes full advantage of covalent epitaxy with chemical bonding for fixing the atomic registry and crystal orientation, while circumventing its stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements; conversely, it ensures the full flexibility of vdW epitaxy, while avoiding its poor orientation control. Cr5Te8 2D crystals grown by dative epitaxy exhibit square magnetic hysteresis, suggesting minimized interfacial defects that can serve as pinning sites.

         <title>Intrinsic Carbon Defects Induced Reversible Antimony Chemistry for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new antimony (Sb) anode with high areal capacity and long&#8208;lasting at practical levels is designed for advanced aqueous alkaline batteries (AABs). The massive intrinsic defect&#8208;modified carbon skeleton (D&#8208;CS) provides positive charge centers, and its homogeneous surface curvature endows a uniform local electric field, which promotes the ion kinetics behavior, effectively controls nucleation, and optimizes the plating/stripping electrochemistry.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;capacity, dendrite&#8208;free, and stable anode materials for robust aqueous alkaline batteries (AABs) is an ongoing challenge. Antimony (Sb) is predicated as an attractive anode material, but it still suffers from low capacity and poor stability caused by the obstructed kinetic behavior and uncontrollable nucleation for SbO2&#8722;. Herein, designing a new defect&#8208;modified carbon skeleton (D&#8208;CS), a highly reversible Sb anode with ultralong cycling stability is realized at practical levels of capacity and high depth of discharge (DOD). The abundant intrinsic carbon defects can effectively form positive charge centers to weaken electrostatic repulsion between SbO2&#8722; and electrode surface, facilitating the fast ion kinetics and provide generous controllable nucleation sites. In addition, the uniform electric field distribution of the D&#8208;CS induces manageable plating and stripping of the Sb metal, which effectively boosts its electrochemical reversibility and restrains adverse reactions. Accordingly, the Sb/D&#8208;CS electrode achieves a long cycle life of over 500 h with a capacity of 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Even at an ultrahigh capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, it can still work stably up to 40 h. Furthermore, its feasibility as advanced anode in AABs is also confirmed by assembled Ni//Sb/D&#8208;CS full batteries with an ultrahigh capacity of 13.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a considerable stability of 4500 cycles.

         <title>Process&#8208;aid solid engineering triggers delicately modulation of Y&#8208;series non&#8208;fullerene acceptor for efficient organic solar cells</title>

Abstract
Volatile solids with symmetric&#160;&#960;&#8208;backbone have been intensively implemented on manipulating the nanomorphology for improving the operability and stability of organic solar cells. However, due to the isotropic stacking, the announced solids with symmetric geometry cannot modify the microscopic phase separation and component distribution collaboratively, which would constrain the promotion of exciton splitting and charge collection efficiency. Inspired by the superiorities of asymmetric configuration, a novel process&#8208;aid solid (PAS) engineering is proposed. By coupling with BTP core unit in Y&#8208;series molecule, an asymmetric, volatile 1, 3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;chlorobenzene (DBCl) solid can induce the anisotropic dipole direction, elevated dipole moment, and interlaminar interaction spontaneously. Due to the synergetic effects on the favorable phase separation and desired component distribution, the PAS treated devices feature the evident improvement of exciton splitting, charge transport, and collection, accompanied by the suppressed trap&#8208;assisted recombination. Consequently, we achieve an impressive fill factor of 80.2% with maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5% in the PAS treated device. More strikingly, the PAS treated devices demonstrate a promising thickness&#8208;tolerance character, where a record PCE of 17.0% is yielded in PAS devices with a 300&#160;nm thickness photoactive layer, which represents the highest PCE for thick&#8208;film OSCs.

         <title>Engineering Hibiscus&#8208;like Riboflavin/ZIF&#8208;8 Microsphere Composites to Enhance Transepithelial Corneal Cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Riboflavin&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate (RF) is the most commonly used photosensitizer in corneal cross&#8208;linking (CXL), but its hydrophilicity and negative charge limit its penetration through the corneal epithelium into the stroma. To enhance the corneal permeability of RF and promote its efficacy in the treatment of keratoconus, novel hibiscus&#8208;like RF@ZIF&#8208;8 microsphere composites [6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF (nanoflake)] were prepared using ZIF&#8208;8 nanomaterials as carriers, which are characterized by their hydrophobicity, positive potential, biocompatibility, high loading capacities, and large surface areas. Both hematoxylin and eosin endothelial staining and TUNEL assays demonstrated excellent biocompatibility of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF. In in vivo studies, the 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF displayed excellent corneal permeation, and outstanding transepithelial CXL (TE&#8208;CXL) efficacy, slightly better than the conventional CXL protocol. Furthermore, the special hibiscus&#8208;like structures of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF meant that it had better TE&#8208;CXL efficacy than that of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NP (nanoparticles) due to the larger contact area with the epithelium and the shorter RF release passage. These results suggest that the 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF are promising for transepithelial corneal cross&#8208;linking, avoiding the need for epithelial debridement.

Abstract
Within the last decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of transistors utilizing 2D semiconductors. Also, small circuits consisting of a few transistors have been demonstrated, including inverters, ring oscillators, and SRAM cells. However, for industrial applications, both time&#8208;zero and time&#8208;dependent variability in the performance of the transistors appear critical. While time&#8208;zero variability is primarily related to immature processing, time&#8208;dependent drifts are dominated by charge trapping at defects located at the channel/insulator interface and in the insulator itself, which can substantially degrade the stability of circuits. At the current state of the art, 2D transistors typically exhibit a few orders of magnitude higher trap densities than silicon devices, which considerably increases their time&#8208;dependent variability, resulting in stability and yield issues. Here, the stability of currently available 2D electronics is carefully evaluated using circuit simulations to determine the impact of transistor&#8208;related issues on the overall circuit performance. Our&#160;results suggest that while the performance parameters of transistors based on certain material combinations are already getting close to being competitive with Si technologies, a reduction in variability and defect densities is required. Overall, our&#160;criteria for parameter variability serve as guidance for evaluating the future development of 2D&#160;technologies.

         <title>Intracellular Mechanical Drugs Induce Cell&#8208;Cycle Altering and Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;based chips, larger than cell mitotic diameter, are established in this work as intracellular mechanical drugs. Once internalized, these tools disrupt the correct development of the cell, inducing mechanical affection of the cell cycle and cell death. The intracellular mechanical drugs allow the study of how intracellular mechanical cues define cell function with relevance to fundamental cell mechanics and nanomedicine.








Abstract
Current advances in materials science have demonstrated that extracellular mechanical cues can define cell function and cell fate. However, a fundamental understanding of the manner in which intracellular mechanical cues affect cell mechanics remains elusive. How intracellular mechanical hindrance, reinforcement, and supports interfere with the cell cycle and promote cell death is described here. Reproducible devices with highly controlled size, shape, and with a broad range of stiffness are internalized in HeLa cells. Once inside, they induce characteristic cell&#8208;cycle deviations and promote cell death. Device shape and stiffness are the dominant determinants of mechanical impairment. Device structural support to the cell membrane and centering during mitosis maximize their effects, preventing spindle centering, and correct chromosome alignment. Nanodevices reveal that the spindle generates forces larger than 114 nN which overcomes intracellular confinement by relocating the device to a less damaging position. By using intracellular mechanical drugs, this work provides a foundation to defining the role of intracellular constraints on cell function and fate, with relevance to fundamental cell mechanics and nanomedicine.

         <title>Current and Future Trends for Polymer Micro/nano Processing in Industrial Applications</title>

Abstract
Polymers have been widely used in optical devices, electronic devices, energy&#8208;harvesting/storage devices, and sensors, owing to their low weight, excellent flexibility, and simple fabrication process. With advancements in micro/nano processing techniques and more demanding application requirements, it is becoming necessary to realize high&#8208;resolution fabrication of polymers to prepare miniaturized devices. This is particularly because, conventional processing technologies suffer from high thermal stress and strong adhesion/friction, which can irreversibly damage the micro/nanostructures of miniaturized devices. In addition, although the use of advanced fabrication methods to prepare high&#8208;resolution micro/nanostructures has been explored, these methods are limited to laboratory research or small&#8208;batch production. This review focuses on the micro/nano processing of polymeric materials and devices with high spatial precision and replication accuracy for industrial applications. Specifically, we discuss the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and future trends for micro/nano molding, high&#8208;energy beam processing, and micro/nano machining. Moreover, we provide an overview of the fabrication and applications of various polymer&#8208;based elements and devices such as microlenses, biosensors, and transistors. We expect these techniques to be widely applied for multiscale and multimaterial processing as well as for multifunction integration in next&#8208;generation integrated devices, such as photoelectric, smart and biodegradable devices.

         <title>Photonic&#8208;crafting of non&#8208;volatile and rewritable antiferromagnetic spin textures with drastic difference in electrical conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Antiferromagnetic spintronics is an emerging field of non&#8208;volatile data storage and information processing. The zero net magnetization and zero stray fields of antiferromagnetic materials eliminate interference between neighbor units, leading to high&#8208;density memory integrations. However, this invisible magnetic character at the same time also poses a great challenge in controlling and detecting magnetic states in antiferromagnets. Here, we discover two antiferromagnetic spin states close in energy in strained BiFeO3 thin films at room temperature. We can reversibly switch between these two non&#8208;volatile antiferromagnetic states by a moderate magnetic field and a non&#8208;contact optical approach. Importantly, the conductivity of the areas with each antiferromagnetic textures is drastically different. We conclusively demonstrate the capability of optical writing and electrical reading of this newly discovered bistable antiferromagnetic states in the BiFeO3 thin films.

         <title>Emerging Trends in Sustainable CO2 Management Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the rising level of atmospheric CO2 worsening climate change, a promising global movement toward carbon neutrality is forming urgently. Sustainable CO2 management based on carbon capture and utilization has garnered considerable interest due to its critical role in resolving emission&#8208;control and energy&#8208;supply challenges. Here we present a comprehensive review that summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in developing promising materials for sustainable CO2 management in terms of not only capture, catalytic conversion (thermochemistry, electrochemistry, photochemistry, and possible combinations), and direct utilization, but also emerging integrated capture and in situ conversion as well as artificial intelligence&#8208;driven smart material study. In particular, the review offers insights that span multiple scopes of material research, ranging from mechanistic comprehension of reactions, rational design and precise manipulation of key materials (e.g., carbon nanomaterials, MOFs, COFs, zeolites, ionic liquids), to industrial implementation. This review concludes with a summary and new perspectives, especially from multiple aspects of the society, which summarizes the major difficulties and future potential for implementing advanced materials and technologies in sustainable CO2 management. This work may serve as a guideline and road map for developing CO2 capture and utilization material systems, benefiting both scientists and engineers working in this growing and potentially game&#8208;changing area.

         <title>Molecular Programming of NIR&#8208;IIb&#8208;Emissive Semiconducting Small Molecules for In Vivo High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging Beyond 1500&#8201;nm</title>

Abstract
Materials with long&#8208;wavelength second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission are highly desired for in vivo dynamic visualizating of microstructures in deep tissues. Herein, by employing an atom&#8208;programming strategy, we developed a series of highly fluorescent semiconducting oligomers (SOMs) with tunable NIR&#8208;IIb emissions for bioimaging applications. After self&#8208;assembly into nanoparticles (NPs), they show good brightness, high photostability, and satisfactory biocompatibility. The SOM NPs were applied as probes for high&#8208;resolution imaging of whole&#8208;body and hind&#8208;limb blood vessels, biliary tract, and bladder with their emissions over 1500&#160;nm. This work demonstrates an atom&#8208;programming strategy for constructing semiconducting small molecules with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence for deep&#8208;tissue imaging, affording new insight for advancing molecular design of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

         <title>Physically Detachable and Operationally Stable Cs2SnI6 Photodetector Arrays Integrated with &#181;&#8208;LEDs for Broadband Flexible Optical Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable Cs2SnI6 (CSI) particles via hydriodic acid precursor optimization are reported. For system&#8208;level demonstration, physically detachable 3 &#215; 3 photodector (PD) arrays, assembled with micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (&#181;&#8208;LEDs) as light sources, are demonstrated to cover the broadband spectrum of UV&#8211;visible&#8211;near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) and hold great promise for future wireless optical interconnection.








Abstract
With the surge in perovskite research, practical features for future applications are desired to be secured, but the reliability of the materials and the use of hazardous Pb are longstanding problems. Here, an air&#8208;stable Cs2SnI6 (CSI) is prepared via diluted hydriodic acid solvent&#8208;based precursor optimization during scalable hydrothermal growth. Materials characterization is performed using various elemental peak analyses and crystallographic identification. The resulting CSI exhibits long&#8208;term operating stability over 6 months, i) at elevated temperatures, ii) in ambient air, and iii) under light illumination from UV to near&#8208;infrared. More importantly, to demonstrate an intriguing class of applications up to system level, physically detachable CSI photodetector arrays (PD&#8208;arrays), integrated with micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (&#956;&#8208;LEDs) arrays, are successfully fabricated. In addition, 3&#160;&#215; 3 flexible CSI PDs are fully operational, even in air, and their spatial uniformity in pixels is quantitatively evaluated. The charge&#8208;transport mechanisms of the CSI PDs under light and elevated temperature are assessed via temperature&#8208;dependent characterization from 148 to 373 K, implying the involvement of 3D variable&#8208;range hopping. Multicycle evaluation of the CSI PD&#8208;arrays confirms their operational stability in AC and DC modes, demonstrating this platform's potential benefit for wireless optical interconnection in advanced Si technology.

         <title>Transferring Liquid Metal to form a Hybrid Solid Electrolyte via a Wettability&#8208;Tuning Technology for Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;derived hybrid solid electrolyte is fabricated by a wettability&#8208;tuning transfer technique. By sandwiching liquid metal between electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conductive LiF and oxides, the resulting composite anodes can realize high cycling stability for &gt;4000 h at 1 mAh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Integrating solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) into Li&#8208;metal anodes has demonstrated great promise to unleash the high energy density of rechargeable Li&#8208;metal batteries. However, fabricating a highly cyclable SSE/Li&#8208;metal anode remains a major challenge because the densification of the SSE is usually incompatible with the reactive Li metal. Here, a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;derived hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) is proposed, and a facile transfer technology to construct an artificial HSE on the Li metal is reported. By tuning the wettability of the transfer substrates, electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;conductive liquid metal is sandwiched between electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conductive LiF and oxides to form the HSE. The transfer technology renders the HSE continuous, dense, and uniform. The HSE, having high ion transport, electron shut&#8208;off, and mechanical strength, makes the composite anode deliver excellent cyclability for over 4000 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell. When pairing with LiFePO4 and sulfur cathodes, the HSE&#8208;coated Li metal dramatically enhances the performance of full cells. Therefore, this work demonstrates that tuning the interfacial wetting properties provides an alternate approach to build a robust solid electrolyte, which enables highly efficient Li&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Alloying Co Species into Ordered and Interconnected Macroporous Carbon Polyhedra for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically ordered porous carbon&#8208;supported Co alloy nanoparticle (Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP) is rationally designed. Owing to the alloying effect, highly exposed active sites, and enhanced mass transfer, the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP exhibits an exceptional catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in a rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Engineering non&#8208;precious transition metal (TM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts to simultaneously achieve an optimal intrinsic activity, high density of active sites, and rapid mass transfer ability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, a hybrid composite consisting of FexCo alloy nanoparticles uniformly implanted into hierarchically ordered macro&#8208;/meso&#8208;/microporous N&#8208;doped carbon polyhedra (HOMNCP) is rationally designed. The combined results of experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the alloying of Co enables a favorable electronic structure for the formation of the *OH intermediate, while the periodically trimodal&#8208;porous structured carbon matrix structure not only provides highly accessible channels for active site utilization but also dramatically facilitates mass transfer in the catalytic process. As expected, the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP composite catalyst exhibits extraordinary ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.903&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), surpassing most Co&#8208;based catalysts reported to date. More remarkably, the use of the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP catalyst as the air electrode in a zinc&#8211;air battery results in superior open&#8208;circuit voltage and power density compared to a commercial Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst. The results of this study are expected to inspire the development of advanced TM&#8208;based catalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Modulating Electron Transfer in Vanadium&#8208;Based Artificial Enzymes for Enhanced ROS&#8208;Catalysis and Disinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new vanadium&#8208;based artificial enzyme (VOx&#8208;AE) for efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;catalysis is synthesized by modulating the d electrons in the active centers via a unique Zn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge structure. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the VOx&#8208;AE exhibits optimal adsorption/dissociation of oxygen&#8208;intermediates, thus showing enhanced ROS catalytic activity and augmented eradication of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and comparable wound&#8208;treatment indexes to antibiotics.








Abstract
Nanomaterials&#8208;based artificial enzymes (AEs) have flourished for more than a decade. However, it is still challenging to further enhance their biocatalytic performances due to the limited strategies to tune the electronic structures of active centers. Here, a new path is reported for the de novo design of the d electrons of active centers by modulating the electron transfer in vanadium&#8208;based AEs (VOx&#8208;AE) via a unique Zn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge for efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;catalysis. Benefiting from the electron transfer from Zn to V, the V site in VOx&#8208;AE exhibits a lower valence state than that in V2O5, which results in charge&#8208;filled V&#8208;dyz orbital near the Fermi level to interfere with the formation of sigma bonds between the V&#8208;dz2 and O&#8208;pz orbitals in H2O2. The VOx&#8208;AE exhibits a twofold Vmax and threefold turnover number than V2O5 when catalyzing H2O2. Meanwhile, the VOx&#8208;AE shows enhanced catalytic eradication of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and achieves comparable wound&#8208;treatment indexes to vancomycin. This modulating charge&#8208;filling of d electrons provides a new direction for the de novo design of nanomaterials&#8208;based AEs and deepens the understanding of ROS&#8208;catalysis.

A stretchable, breathable, and stable nanofiber composite (LPPS&#8208;NFC) through electrospinning of lead&#8208;free perovskite/poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene (SEBS) is reported. The Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskites exhibit great charge trapping capacity and energy level matching with PVDF&#8208;HFP. As a result, the LPPS&#8208;NFC&#8208;based energy harvester displays excellent electrical output (400&#160;V, 2.34 W m&#8722;2), setting a record of the output voltage among halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based nanogenerators.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based mechanical energy harvesters display excellent electrical output due to their unique ferroelectricity and dielectricity. However, their high toxicity and moisture sensitivity impede their practical applications. Herein, a stretchable, breathable, and stable nanofiber composite (LPPS&#8208;NFC) is fabricated through electrospinning of lead&#8208;free perovskite/poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene (SEBS). The Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskites serve as efficient electron acceptors and local nucleating agents for the crystallization of polymer chains, thereby enhancing the electron&#8208;trapping capacity and polar crystalline phase in LPPS&#8208;NFC. The excellent energy level matching between Cs3Bi2Br9 and PVDF&#8208;HFP boosts the electron transfer efficiency and reduces the charge loss, thereby promoting the electron&#8208;trapping process. Consequently, this LPPS&#8208;NFC&#8208;based energy harvester displays an excellent electrical output (400&#160;V, 1.63 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, and 2.34 W m&#8722;2), setting a record of the output voltage among halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based nanogenerators. The LPPS&#8208;NFC also exhibits excellent stretchability, waterproofness, and breathability, enabling the fabrication of robust wearable devices that convert mechanical energy from different biomechanical motions into electrical power to drive common electronic devices. The LPPS&#8208;NFC&#8208;based energy harvesters also endure extreme mechanical deformations (washing, folding, and crumpling) without performance degradation, and maintain stable electrical output up to 5 months, demonstrating their promising potential for use as smart textiles and wearable power sources.

         <title>An Electroluminodynamic Flexible Device for Highly Efficient Eradication of Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electroluminodynamic therapy (ELDT) strategy is presented based on electroluminescence&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under an electric field, which avoids the utilization of a physical light source, as used in photodynamic therapy, and achieves convenient and effective inhibition of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infection through a hydrogel&#8208;based flexible therapeutic device.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted wide attention in antibacterial applications due to its advantages of spatial&#8208;temporal selectivity, noninvasiveness, and low incidence to develop drug resistance. To make it more convenient, universal, and manipulatable for clinical application, a conceptually antibacterial strategy, namely &#8220;electroluminodynamic therapy&#8221; (ELDT), is presented by nanoassembly of an electroluminescent (EL) material and a photosensitizer, which is capable of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in situ under an electric field, i.e., the fluorescence emitted by the EL molecules excites the photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen (1O2), for the oxidative damage of pathogens. Based on the scheme of ELDT, a flexible therapeutic device is fabricated through a hydrogel loading with ELDT nanoagents, followed by integration with a flexible battery, satisfying the requirements of being light and wearable for wound dressings. The ELDT&#8208;based flexible device presents potent ROS&#8208;induced killing efficacies against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria (&gt;99.9%), so as to effectively inhibit the superficial infection and promote the wound healing. This research reveals a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ELDT strategy as a prospective alternative to PDT, which avoids the utilization of a physical light source, and achieves convenient and effective killing of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria through a hydrogel&#8208;based flexible therapeutic device.

         <title>Multiple 2D Phase Transformations in Monolayer Transition Metal Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase transformation lies at the heart of materials science because it allows for the control of structural phases of solids with desired properties. It has long been a challenge to manipulate phase transformations in crystals at the nanoscale with designed interfaces and compositions. Here we employ in&#8208;situ electron microscopy to fabricate novel 2D phases with different stoichiometries in monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2. We observe the multiphase transformations: MoS2 &#8594; Mo4S6 and MoSe2 &#8594; Mo6Se6 which are highly localized with atomically sharp boundaries. Their atomic mechanisms are determined as chalcogen 2H &#8596; 1T sliding, cation shift, and commensurate lattice reconstructions, resulting in decreasing direct bandgaps and even a semiconductor&#8208;metal transition. Our results will be a paradigm for the manipulation of multiphase heterostructures with controlled compositions and sharp interfaces, which will guide the future phase engineered electronics and optoelectronics of metal chalcogenides.

         <title>A Bi&#8208;layer Hydrogel Cardiac Patch Made of Recombinant Functional Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of minimally invasive cardiac patches, either as hemostatic dressing or treating myocardial infarction, is of clinical significance but remains a major challenge. Designing such patches often requires simultaneous consideration of several material attributes, including bioabsorption, non&#8208;toxicity, matching the mechanic properties of heart tissues, and working efficiently in wet and dynamic environments. Using genetically engineered multi&#8208;domain proteins, we report a printed bi&#8208;layer proteinaceous hydrogel patch for heart failure treatments. The intrinsic self&#8208;healing nature of hydrogel materials physically enables seamless interfacial integration of two disparate hydrogel layers and functionally endows the cardiac patches with the combinatorial advantages of each layer. Leveraging the biocompatibility, structural stability, and tunable drug release properties of the bi&#8208;layer hydrogel, we demonstrate promising effects of hemostasis, fibrosis reduction, and heart function recovery on mice with two myocardium damage models. Moreover, this proteinaceous patch is proved biodegradable in vivo without any additive inflammations. In conclusion, our work introduces a promising new type of minimally invasive patch based on genetically modified double&#8208;layer protein gel for treating heart&#8208;related injuries or diseases.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Robust and Extensible Fibrous Mechanical Sensors for Wearable Smart Healthcare</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fibrous material with high strength and large stretchability is an essential component of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic devices. Wearable electronic systems require a material that is strong to ensure durability and stability, and a wide range of strain to expand their applications. However, it is still challenging to manufacture fibrous materials with simultaneously high mechanical strength and the tensile property. Herein, we developed the ultra&#8208;robust (&#8764;17.6&#160;MPa) and extensible (&#8764;700%) conducting microfibers and demonstrated their applications in fabricating fibrous mechanical sensors. The mechanical sensor shows high sensitivity in detecting strains that have high strain resolution and a large detection range (from 0.0075% to 400%) simultaneously. Moreover, low frequency vibrations between 0 and 40&#160;Hz are also detected, which is covers most tremors that occur in the human body. As a further step, a wearable and smart health&#8208;monitoring system has been developed using the fibrous mechanical sensor, which is capable of monitoring health&#8208;related physiological signals, including muscle movement, body tremor, wrist pulse, respiration, gesture, and six body postures to predict and diagnose diseases, which will promote the wearable telemedicine technology.

Moreover, low frequency vibrations between 0 and 40&#160;Hz are also detected, which is covers most tremors that occur in the human body. As a further step, a wearable and smart health-monitoring system has been developed using the fibrous mechanical sensor, which is capable of monitoring health-related physiological signals, including muscle movement, body tremor, wrist pulse, respiration, gesture, and six body postures to predict and diagnose diseases, which will promote the wearable telemedicine technology.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Dependent Mechanochromism of Dion&#8211;Jacobson and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible mechanochromism of Dion&#8211;Jacobson and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper layered hybrid perovskites based on 1,4&#8208;phenylenedimethylammonium and benzylammonium spacers is demonstrated in the 0&#8211;0.35 GPa pressure range. X&#8208;ray scattering and density functional theory calculations under pressure reveal that this is related to the structural interplay between the spacer and the inorganic framework, providing critical insights that expand the perspectives for future applications.








Abstract
Layered Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) hybrid perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their modular structure. To fully exploit their functionality, mechanical stimuli can be used to control their properties without changing the composition. However, the responsiveness of these systems to pressure compatible with practical applications (&lt;1&#160;GPa) remains unexploited. Hydrostatic pressure is used to investigate the structure&#8211;property relationships in representative iodide and bromide DJ and RP 2D perovskites based on 1,4&#8208;phenylenedimethylammonium (PDMA) and benzylammonium (BzA) spacers in the 0&#8211;0.35&#160;GPa pressure range. Pressure&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal that lattices of these compositions monotonically shrink and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the structural changes within the organic spacer layer. These structural changes affect the optical properties; the most significant shift in the optical absorption is observed in (BzA)2PbBr4 under 0.35&#160;GPa pressure, which is attributed to an isostructural phase transition. Surprisingly, the RP and DJ perovskites behave similarly under pressure, despite the different binding modes of the spacer molecules. This study provides important insights into how the manipulation of the crystal structure affects the optoelectronic properties of such materials, whereas the reversibility of their response expands the perspectives for future applications.

         <title>Biomineralized Materials as Model Systems for Structural Composites: 3D Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomineralized load&#8208;bearing materials are intrinsically 3D composites and are widely used as model systems for developing novel structural materials with improved mechanical performance. This review presents recent progress in understanding the 3D architectural design of biomineralized composites. The emerging approaches to investigate their 3D structure&#8211;mechanical property&#8211;biomimetics relationships are also discussed.








Abstract
Biomineralized materials are sophisticated material systems with hierarchical 3D material architectures, which are broadly used as model systems for fundamental mechanical, materials science, and biomimetic studies. The current knowledge of the structure of biological materials is mainly based on 2D imaging, which often impedes comprehensive and accurate understanding of the materials&#8217; intricate 3D microstructure and consequently their mechanics, functions, and bioinspired designs. The development of 3D techniques such as tomography, additive manufacturing, and 4D testing has opened pathways to study biological materials fully in 3D. This review discusses how applying 3D techniques can provide new insights into biomineralized materials that are either well known or possess complex microstructures that are challenging to understand in the 2D framework. The diverse structures of biomineralized materials are characterized based on four universal structural motifs. Nacre is selected as an example to demonstrate how the progression of knowledge from 2D to 3D can bring substantial improvements to understanding the growth mechanism, biomechanics, and bioinspired designs. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiscale 3D tomographic techniques are discussed with a focus on their integration with 3D geometric quantification, 4D in situ experiments, and multiscale modeling. Outlook is given on the emerging approaches to investigate the synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;function&#8211;biomimetics relationship.

         <title>A Review on Mechanochemistry: Approaching Advanced Energy Materials with Greener Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry as a powerful tool to prepare advanced energy materials is reviewed, covering specific aspects of energy transformations from mechanical/optical/chemical energy to electrical energy. This review intends to comprehensively clarify mechanism, features, and methods of mechanochemistry and summarize the latest advances and progress in this field to inspire interdisciplinary research for developing novel energy materials with greener mechanical force.








Abstract
Mechanochemistry with solvent&#8208;free and environmentally friendly characteristics is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional liquid&#8208;phase&#8208;based reactions, demonstrating epoch&#8208;making significance in the realization of different types of chemistry. Mechanochemistry utilizes mechanical energy to promote physical and chemical transformations to design complex molecules and nanostructured materials, encourage dispersion and recombination of multiphase components, and accelerate reaction rates and efficiencies via highly reactive surfaces. In particular, mechanochemistry deserves special attention because it is capable of endowing energy materials with unique characteristics and properties. Herein, the latest advances and progress in mechanochemistry for the preparation and modification of energy materials are reviewed. An outline of the basic knowledge, methods, and characteristics of different mechanochemical strategies is presented, distinguishing this review from most mechanochemistry reviews that only focus on ball&#8208;milling. Next, this outline is followed by a detailed and insightful discussion of mechanochemistry&#8208;involved energy conversion and storage applications. The discussion comprehensively covers aspects of energy transformations from mechanical/optical/chemical energy to electrical energy. Finally, next&#8208;generation advanced energy materials are proposed. This review is intended to bring mechanochemistry to the frontline and guide this burgeoning field of interdisciplinary research for developing advanced energy materials with greener mechanical force.

         <title>Patterning of Wafer&#8208;Scale MXene Films for High&#8208;Performance Image Sensor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes are promising for future electronics and optoelectronics; however, previously reported patterning methods lack efficiency, resolution, and compatibility with mainstream semiconductor processing. Here, a wafer&#8208;scale combination patterning method with a resolution up to the micrometer scale is developed, resulting in an integrated array of 1024&#8208;pixel Ti3C2Tx/Si photodetectors with a record&#8208;high detectivity of 7.73 &#215; 1014 Jones.








Abstract
As a rapidly growing family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, MXenes are recognized as promising materials for the development of future electronics and optoelectronics. So far, the reported patterning methods for MXene films lack efficiency, resolution, and compatibility, resulting in limited device integration and performance. Here, a high&#8208;performance MXene image sensor array fabricated by a wafer&#8208;scale combination patterning method of an MXene film is reported. This method combines MXene centrifugation, spin&#8208;coating, photolithography, and dry&#8208;etching and is highly compatible with mainstream semiconductor processing, with a resolution up to 2&#160;&#181;m, which is at least 100 times higher than other large&#8208;area patterning methods reported previously. As a result, a high&#8208;density integrated array of 1024&#8208;pixel Ti3C2Tx/Si photodetectors with a detectivity of 7.73 &#215; 1014 Jones and a light&#8211;dark current ratio (Ilight/Idark) of 6.22 &#215; 106, which is the ultrahigh value among all reported MXene&#8208;based photodetectors, is fabricated. This patterning technique paves a way for large&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MXetronics compatible with mainstream semiconductor processes.

         <title>Nanosphere Lithography: A Versatile Approach to Develop Transparent Conductive Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanosphere lithography is a versatile platform for building 2D transparent nanomesh electrodes and optoelectronics. This review gives a critical overview of the recent research concerning the nanosphere lithography for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performing transparent conductive film design and fabrication toward flexible optoelectronics for energy conversion and storage, sensors, displays, and other applications.








Abstract
Transparent conductive films (TCFs) are irreplaceable components in most optoelectronic applications such as solar cells, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, sensors, smart windows, and bioelectronics. The shortcomings of existing traditional transparent conductors demand the development of new material systems that are both transparent and electrically conductive, with variable functionality to meet the requirements of new generation optoelectronic devices. In this respect, TCFs with periodic or irregular nanomesh structures have recently emerged as promising candidates, which possess superior mechanical properties in comparison with conventional metal oxide TCFs. Among the methods for nanomesh TCFs fabrication, nanosphere lithography (NSL) has proven to be a versatile platform, with which a wide range of morphologically distinct nanomesh TCFs have been demonstrated. These materials are not only functionally diverse, but also have advantages in terms of device compatibility. This review provides a comprehensive description of the NSL process and its most relevant derivatives to fabricate nanomesh TCFs. The structure&#8208;property relationships of these materials are elaborated and an overview of their application in different technologies across disciplines related to optoelectronics is given. It is concluded with a perspective on current shortcomings and future directions to further advance the field.

         <title>Controlled Crystal Plane Orientations in the ZnO Transport Layer Enable High&#8208;Responsivity, Low&#8208;Dark&#8208;Current Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presently, zinc oxide is the electron&#8208;transport layer of choice in colloidal quantum dot photodetectors; however, ZnO relies on continuous ultraviolet illumination to remove adsorbed oxygen and maintain high performance. This problem is addressed by developing an electroneutral plane composition at the ZnO surface, aided by atomic layer deposition, while maintaining high external quantum efficiency and low dark current.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQD) have emerged as attractive materials for infrared (IR) photodetector (PD) applications because of their tunable bandgaps and facile processing. Presently, zinc oxide is the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) of choice in CQD PDs; however, ZnO relies on continuous ultraviolet (UV) illumination to remove adsorbed oxygen and maintain high external quantum efficiency (EQE), speed, and photocurrent. Here, it is shown that ZnO is dominated by electropositive crystal planes which favor excessive oxygen adsorption, and that this leads to a high density of trap states, an undesired shift in band alignment, and consequent poor performance. Over prolonged operation without UV exposure, oxygen accumulates at the electropositive planes, trapping holes and degrading performance. This problem is addressed by developing an electroneutral plane composition at the ZnO surface, aided by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as the means of materials processing. It is found that ALD ZnO has 10&#215; lower binding energy for oxygen than does conventionally deposited ZnO. IR CQD PDs made with this ETL do not require UV activation to maintain low dark current and high EQE.

         <title>Influence of Oxidation On Structure, Performance, and Application of Metallic Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to their unique structure and outstanding properties, metallic glasses are a novel class of structural and functional materials with vast application prospects. However, the metastable amorphous structures and chemical activity of metallic glass constituent elements lead to frequent oxidation during preparation, processing, and application. Comprehensively understanding the oxidation behaviors and underlying mechanisms of metallic glasses is essential for gaining knowledge of metallic glass structures and properties and for promoting engineering applications. Although many studies have examined these issues, more investigations are still required to explore potential industrial applications of metallic glasses. This review consolidates recent research on metallic glass oxidation by summarizing the oxidation influence on metallic glass structure, performance, and application and discusses the possibilities and feasibility of oxidizing metallic glasses to reinforce materials or develop material systems.

         <title>Anion&#8208;exchange Driven Phase Transition in CsPbI3 Nanowires for Fabricating Epitaxial Perovskite Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange in halide perovskites provides a unique pathway of bandgap engineering for fabricating heterojunctions in low&#8208;cost photovoltaics and optoelectronics. However, it remains challenging to achieve robust and sharp perovskite heterojunctions, due to the spontaneous anion interdiffusion across the heterojunction in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites. Here, we show that the anionic behavior in 1D perovskites are fundamentally different, that the anion exchange can readily drive an indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap phase transition in CsPbI3 nanowires (NWs) and greatly lower the phase transition temperature. In addition, the heterojunction created by phase transition is epitaxial in nature, and its chemical composition can be precisely controlled upon post&#8208;annealing. Further study of the phase transition dynamics reveals a threshold&#8208;dominating anion exchange mechanism in these 1D NWs rather than the gradient&#8208;dominating mechanism in 3D systems. Our results provide important insights into the ionic behavior in halide perovskites, which is beneficial for applications in solar cells, LEDs, and other semiconductor devices.

         <title>Production of Large&#8208;Area Nucleus&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene&#8208;Mesh Metamaterials with Zigzag Edges</title>

Abstract
In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices. Herein, we demonstrate the controlled production of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films with zigzag edges. We utilize the 13C&#8208;isotopic labeling graphene&#8208;growth approach, large&#8208;area Raman mapping techniques, and a uniquely designed high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization etching method to directly remove the graphene nuclei. Subsequently, a hydrogen&#8208;assisted anisotropic etching process is employed for transforming irregular edges into the zigzag edges within the hexagonal&#8208;shaped holes, producing a large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;quality graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial film on a Cu(111) substrate. The carrier mobilities of the fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors on the as&#8208;produced films are measured. The findings of this study enable the large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials and provide insights for the application of integrated circuits based on graphene and other two&#8208;dimensional metamaterials.

         <title>The Universal Growth of Ultrathin Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskites have engaged significant attention owing to rich species and remarkable physical properties as well as optoelectronic applications. Compared to bulk counterparts, ultrathin perovskites exhibit more available compositions due to the breaking of bulk lattice limitation. Coupled with crystal lattice relaxation and quantum confinement, infinite intriguing properties of ultrathin perovskites deserve to be explored. Developing ultrathin perovskites with alterable composition and structure is a necessity to fully explore this versatile family. Herein, we conceived a universal strategy via constructing oriented solvent microenvironment induced by the interfacial electric field originated from the charge separation between solid and liquid phases, which is conducive to controlling the precursor distribution and makes crystals preferentially nucleate and grow in the preferentially lateral mode. From layered to non&#8208;layered, organic to inorganic, and toxic to low&#8208;toxic lead&#8208;free perovskite, we achieved a full&#8208;range synthesis of ultrathin perovskites. Our work opens up opportunities both for ultrathin perovskite exploration through compositional engineering and for device miniaturization in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Sequential Phase Conversion&#8208;Induced Phosphides Heteronanorod Arrays for Superior Hydrogen Evolution Performance to Pt in Wide pH Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing an efficient and non&#8208;precious pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst is highly desirable for hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting but remains a significant challenge. Herein, we built a hierarchical structure composed of heterostructured Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5 nanorod arrays rooted on Ni3S2 film (Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5@Ni3S2) via a simultaneous corrosion and sulfidation followed by a phosphidation treatment towards the metallic nickel foam. The combination of theoretical calculations with in/ex&#8208;situ characterizations unveils that such a unique sequential phase conversion strategy ensures the strong interfacial coupling between Ni2P and Ni12P5 as well as the robust stabilization of one dimensional heteronanorod arrays by Ni3S2 film, resulting in the promoted water adsorption/dissociation energy, the optimized hydrogen adsorption energy and the enhanced electron/proton transfer ability accompanied with an excellent stability. Consequently, Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5@Ni3S2/NF required only 32, 46 and 34&#160;mV overpotentials to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) electrolytes, respectively, exceeding almost all the previously reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work may pave a new avenue for the rational design of non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts towards pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution catalysis.

         <title>Fermi&#8208;Level Pinning&#8208;Free WSe2 Transistors via 2D van der Waals Metal Contacts and their Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Precise control over the polarity of transistors is a key necessity for the construction of complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits. However, the polarity control of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transistors remains a challenge because of the lack of a high&#8208;work&#8208;function electrode that completely eliminates Fermi&#8208;level pinning at metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces. Here, a creation of clean van der Waals contacts is demonstrated, wherein a metallic 2D material, chlorine&#8208;doped SnSe2 (Cl&#8211;SnSe2), is used as the high&#8208;work&#8208;function contact, providing an interface that is free of defects and Fermi&#8208;level pinning. Such clean contacts made from Cl&#8211;SnSe2 can pose nearly ideal Schottky barrier heights, following the Schottky&#8211;Mott limit and thus permitting polarity&#8208;controllable transistors. With the integration of Cl&#8211;SnSe2 as contacts, WSe2 transistors exhibit pronounced p&#8208;type characteristics, which are distinctly different from those of the devices with evaporated metal contacts, where n&#8208;type transport is observed. Finally, this ability to control the polarity enables the fabrication of functional logic gates and circuits, including inverter, NAND, and NOR.

         <title>A family of frost&#8208;resistant and icephobic coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anti&#8208;icing and icephobic materials play a crucial role in demanding applications ranging from energy to transportation systems operating in frigid climates. Despite remarkable advancements in the development of such surface coatings, the use of anti/de&#8208;icing chemicals remains one of the go&#8208;to solutions for ice management. However, they are notoriously prone to removal by shear forces and dissolution. Herein, we report the design rationale for developing a family of cryoprotectant and phase change material&#8208;based compositions in the form of mixtures, non&#8208;aqueous emulsions&#8208;creams, and gels that can substantially overcome such challenges. This is achieved through the sustenance of an in situ generated surface hydration layer that protects the underlying substrate from a variety of foulants, varying from ice to disease&#8208;causing bacteria. Each formulation utilizes unique chemistry to curtail the embodied cryoprotectant loss and can be easily applied as an all&#8208;in&#8208;one sprayable/paintable coating capable of significantly outperforming untreated industrial materials in terms of their ability to delay condensation&#8208;frosting and shed ice simultaneously. Concomitantly, an array of formulation&#8208;specific functionalities is observed in the family, which include optical transparency, mechanical durability, high shear flow stability, and self&#8208;healing characteristics.

         <title>Inhibition and Reconstruction of Zener Tunneling in Photonic Honeycomb Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum coherence is the central element of particle states and characterizes the overall performance of various quantum materials. Bloch oscillation is a fundamental coherent behavior of particles under a static potential, which can be easily destructed by Zener tunneling in multiband two&#8208;dimensional lattice materials. The control of Zener tunneling therefore plays the key role in quantum engineering for complicated physical systems. Here, we&#160;experimentally demonstrate the inhibition and reconstruction of Zener tunneling in photonic honeycomb lattices. We&#160;integrate deformed honeycomb lattices and realize an effective static potential on the two&#8208;dimensional lattice materials. Zener tunneling disappears in stretch&#8208;type lattices and wave packets stay in the dispersionless upper energy band. On the contrary, Zener tunneling is greatly enhanced in compress&#8208;type lattices and wave packets exhibit directional oscillations without branches, which manifest the preserved coherence of wave packets. Our&#160;results demonstrate the protection for photonic coherence by structurally controlling the Zener tunneling, representing a step towards flexible quantum engineering for large&#8208;scale artificial quantum&#160;materials.&#160;

         <title>Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Long&#8208;term Tumor Tracking with Incremental NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report the design and synthesis of the NIR&#8208;II emissive conjugated oligoelectrolyte COE&#8208;BBT. COE&#8208;BBT has a solubility in aqueous media greater than 50&#160;mg mL&#8722;1, low toxicity and a propensity to intercalate lipid bilayers, wherein it exhibits a higher emission quantum yields relative to aqueous media. Addition of COE&#8208;BBT to cells provides two emission channels, at &#8764;500&#160;nm and &#8764;1020&#160;nm, depending on the excitation wavelength, which facilitate in vitro confocal microscopy and in vivo animal imaging. The NIR&#8208;II emission of COE&#8208;BBT was used to track intracranial and subcutaneous tumor progression in mice. Of relevance is that the total NIR&#8208;II intensity increases over time. We attribute this phenomenon to a progressive attenuation of a COE&#8208;BBT self&#8208;quenching effect within the cells due to the expected dye dilution per cell as the tumor proliferates.

         <title>A Magnetically Separable Pd Single&#8208;atom Catalyst for Efficient Selective Hydrogenation of Phenylacetylene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes plays a crucial role in the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, how to achieve high selectivity and effective separation of catalyst and substrates while obtaining high activity is the key for this reaction. In this work, Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) was anchored to the shell of magnetic core&#8208;shell particles that are consisted of the Ni&#8208;nanoparticles core and the graphene sheets shell (Ni@G) for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, delivering 93% selectivity to styrene at full conversion with robust turnover frequency (TOF) of 7074 h&#8211;1 under mild reaction conditions (303 K, 2&#160;bar H2). Moreover, the catalyst can be recovered promptly from the liquid phase due to its magnetic separability, which makes it present good stability for enduring five cycles. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that H2 and substrates were activated by atomically dispersed Pd atoms and Ni@G hybrid support, respectively. The hydrogenation reaction occurred on the surface of Ni@G via hydrogen spillover from metal to support. Such a strategy opens an avenue for designing highly active, selective and magnetically recyclable catalysts for selective hydrogenation in liquid reaction systems.

         <title>A Highly Conducting Polymer for Self&#8208;Healable, Printable and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistor Arrays and Near Hysteresis&#8208;Free Soft Tactile Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A stretchable and self&#8208;healable conductive material with high conductivity is critical to high&#8208;performance wearable electronics and integrated devices for applications where large mechanical deformation is involved. While there has been great progress in developing stretchable and self&#8208;healable conducting materials, it remains challenging to concurrently maintain and recover such functionalities before and after healing. Here, we report a highly stretchable and autonomic self&#8208;healable conducting film consisting of a conducting polymer (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) and a soft&#8208;polymer (poly(2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid, PAAMPSA). The optimal film exhibits outstanding stretchability as high as 630% and high electrical conductivity of 320 S/cm, while possessing the ability to repair both mechanical and electrical breakdowns when undergoing severe damage at ambient conditions. We further utilized this polymer composite film in a tactile sensor, which exhibits good pressure sensitivity of 164.5 kPa&#8315;1, near hysteresis&#8208;free, an ultrafast response time of 19&#160;ms, and excellent endurance over 1500 consecutive presses. Additionally, we successfully demonstrated an integrated 5 &#215; 4 stretchable and self&#8208;healable organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) array with great device performance (including high transconductance of 12.95&#160;&#177; 1.85 mS and good operational stability). The developed stretchable and autonomic self&#8208;healable conducting film significantly increases the practicality and shelf life of wearable electronics, which in turn, reduces maintenance costs and build&#8208;up of electronic waste.

         <title>A Photoelectric Spiking Neuron for Visual Depth Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The biological visual system encodes optical information into spikes and processes them by the neural network, which enables the perception with high throughput of visual processing with ultralow energy budget. This has inspired a wide spectrum of devices to imitate such neural process, while precise mimicking such procedure is still highly required. Here, we present a highly bio&#8208;realistic photoelectric spiking neuron for visual depth perception. The firing spikes generated by the TaOX memristive spiking encoders have a biologically similar frequency range of 1&#8211;200&#160;Hz and sub&#8208;micro watts power. Such spiking encoder is integrated with a photodetector and a network of neuromorphic transistors, for information collection and recognition tasks, respectively. The distance&#8208;dependent response and eye fatigue of biological visual systems have been mimicked based on such photoelectric spiking neuron. The simulated depth perception shows a recognition improvement by adapting to sights at different distances. Our results would advance the technologies in bioinspired or robotic systems that might be endowed them with depth perception and power efficiency at the same time.

         <title>Review of Semiconductor Flash Memory Devices for Material and Process Issues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vertically integrated NAND (V&#8208;NAND) flash memory is the main data storage in modern handheld electronic devices, widening its share even in the data centers where installation and operation costs are critical. While the conventional scaling rule has been applied down to the design rule of &#8764;15&#160;nm (year 2013), the current method of increasing device density is stacking up layers. Currently, 176 layer&#8208;stacked V&#8208;NAND flash memory is available on the market. Nonetheless, increasing the layers invokes several challenges, such as film stress management and deep contact hole etching. Also, there should be an upper bound for the attainable stacking layers (400&#8211;500) due to the total allowable chip thickness, which will be reached within 6&#8211;7 years. This review summarizes the current status and critical challenges of charge&#8208;trap&#8208;based flash memory devices, with a focus on the material (floating&#8208;gate versus charge&#8208;trap&#8208;layer), array&#8208;level circuit architecture (NOR versus NAND), physical integration structure (two&#8208;dimensional versus three&#8208;dimensional), and cell&#8208;level programming technique (single versus multiple levels). Current efforts to improve fabrication processes and device performances using new materials are also introduced. The review suggests directions for future storage devices based on the ionic mechanism, which may overcome the inherent problems of flash memory devices.

         <title>Strain Engineering: A Boosting Strategy for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Whilst the photocatalytic technique is considered to be one of the most significant routes to address the energy crisis and global environmental challenges, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is still far from satisfying practical industrial requirements, which can be traced to the suboptimal bandgap and electronic structure of photocatalysts. Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, to explore promising directions for certain breakthroughs in strained photocatalysts, we provide an overview on the recent advances of strain engineering from the basics of strain effect, creations of strained materials, as well as characterizations and simulations of strain level. Besides, we further summarize the potential applications of strain engineering in photocatalysis, and a vision for the future controllable&#8208;electronic&#8208;structure photocatalysts by strain engineering is also given. Finally, the perspectives on challenges for future strain&#8208;promoted photocatalysis are chiefly discussed, placing emphasis on the creation and decoupling of strain effect, and the modification of theoretical frameworks.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Switch&#8208;Embedded Organic Photodiode for Capturing Images against Strong Backlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded organic photodiode exhibits an autonomous transition of the operation mode between photovoltaic&#8208; and photomultiplication&#8208;type photodiodes, resulting in the extension of the photoresponse linearity to 434 W cm&#8722;2. This mechanism is enabled by the light&#8208;intensity&#8208;adjusted cyclization&#8211;cycloreversion equilibrium of diarylethene&#8208;based molecular switches. Consequently, prototype image sensors with reliable sensitivity against strong backlight are demonstrated.








Abstract
When the intensity of the incident light increases, the photocurrents of organic photodiodes (OPDs) exhibit relatively early saturation, due to which OPDs cannot easily detect objects against strong backlights, such as sunlight. In this study, this problem is addressed by introducing a light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent transition of the operation mode, such that the operation mode of the OPD autonomously changes to overcome early photocurrent saturation as the incident light intensity passes the threshold intensity. The photoactive layer is doped with a strategically designed and synthesized molecular switch, 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanobiphenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;thienyl)tetrafluorobenzene (DAB). The proposed OPD exhibits a typical OPD performance with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &lt;100% and a photomultiplication behavior with an EQE of &gt;100% under low&#8208;intensity and high&#8208;intensity light illuminations, respectively, thereby resulting in an extension of the photoresponse linearity to a light intensity of 434&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This unique and reversible transition of the operation mode can be explained by the unbalanced quantum yield of photocyclization/photocycloreversion of the molecular switch. The details of the operation mechanism are discussed in conjunction with various photophysical analyses. Furthermore, they establish a prototype image sensor with an array of molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded OPD pixels to demonstrate their extremely high sensitivity against strong light illumination.

         <title>Decoupling and Reprogramming the Wiggling Motion of Midge Larvae Using a Soft Robotic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic soft robotic platform to decouple and reprogram complex wiggling motion adopted by invertebrates is presented. By using magnetic soft robot and programmed magnetic field inputs, it is unveiled that the synchronization of body curling and rotation, and the optimal rotation amplitude greatly enhance motility. The robotic platform offers a new toolbox to develop optimized soft&#8208;bodied swimmers with enhanced motility.








Abstract
The efficient motility of invertebrates helps them survive under evolutionary pressures. Reconstructing the locomotion of invertebrates and decoupling the influence of individual basic motion are crucial for understanding their underlying mechanisms, which, however, generally remain a challenge due to the complexity of locomotion gaits. Herein, a magnetic soft robot to reproduce midge larva's key natural swimming gaits is developed, and the coupling effect between body curling and rotation on motility is investigated. Through the authors&#8217; systematically decoupling studies using programmed magnetic field inputs, the soft robot (named LarvaBot) experiences various coupled gaits, including biomimetic side&#8208;to&#8208;side flexures, and unveils that the optimal rotation amplitude and the synchronization of curling and rotation greatly enhance its motility. The LarvaBot achieves fast locomotion and upstream capability at the moderate Reynolds number regime. The soft robotics&#8208;based platform provides new insight to decouple complex biological locomotion, and design programmed swimming gaits for the fast locomotion of soft&#8208;bodied swimmers.

         <title>Chemical Potential Diagram Guided Rational Tuning of Electrical Properties: A Case Study of CsPbBr3 for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical results indicate that the electrical properties of CsPbBr3 can be tuned from weak n&#8208;type under the Pb&#8208;rich condition to moderate p&#8208;type under the Br&#8208;rich condition. Experimentally, a large Fermi level tunability of 1.0 eV is achieved for the CsPbBr3 films by posterior Br2 treatment. The intrinsic CsPbBr3 films are proven to lead to excellent X&#8208;ray detection performance.








Abstract
Controlling the carrier polarity and concentration underlies most electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, for the intensively studied lead halide perovskites, the doping tunability is inefficient. In this work, taking CsPbBr3 as an example, it is revealed that the coexistence of metallic Pb or CsBr3/Br2, rather than the precursor ratio, can provide Pb&#8208;rich/Br&#8208;poor or Br&#8208;rich/Pb&#8208;poor chemical conditions, enabling the tunability of electrical properties from weak n&#8208;type, intrinsic, to moderate p&#8208;type. Experimentally, under Br2&#8208;exposure treatment, a shift of the Fermi level as large as 1.00 eV is achieved, which is one of the highest value among all kinds of doping methods. The X&#8208;ray detector based on the intrinsic CsPbBr3 exhibits excellent performance, with a negligible dark&#8208;current drift of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8722;4 nA cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1, a low detection limit of 103.6 nGyair s&#8722;1, and a high sensitivity of 9085 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This work provides a critical understanding and guidance for tuning the electrical properties of lead halide perovskites, which establishes good foundations for achieving intrinsic perovskite semiconductors and also constructing potential homojunction devices.

         <title>Ion Migration in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Mechanism, Characterizations, and Material and Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental and engineering aspects of ion&#8208;related issues in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are reviewed, including the origins and driving mechanisms of ion migration, characterization approaches for probing ion distribution, impact of ion migration on device performance and stability, and strategies for ion management in PeLEDs. Perspectives on the remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted.








Abstract
In recent years, perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising new lighting technology with high external quantum efficiency, color purity, and wavelength tunability, as well as, low&#8208;temperature processability. However, the operational stability of PeLEDs is still insufficient for their commercialization. The generation and migration of ionic species in metal halide perovskites has been widely acknowledged as the primary factor causing the performance degradation of PeLEDs. Herein, this topic is systematically discussed by considering the fundamental and engineering aspects of ion&#8208;related issues in PeLEDs, including the material and processing origins of ion generation, the mechanisms driving ion migration, characterization approaches for probing ion distributions, the effects of ion migration on device performance and stability, and strategies for ion management in PeLEDs. Finally, perspectives on remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted.

         <title>Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Minimized Optical and Energetic Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic metal&#8208;halide perovskite tandem solar cells reach a power conversion efficiency of 23% after passivating the interfaces of the wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites with the C60 electron transport layer and minimizing the optical losses in the cell by using a hydrogenated indium oxide front contact and a thin hole transporting layers.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based multijunction solar cells are a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology that can help surpass the efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices. However, both mixed&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and lead&#8208;tin narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites suffer from non&#8208;radiative recombination due to the formation of bulk traps and interfacial recombination centers which limit the open&#8208;circuit voltage of sub&#8208;cells and consequently of the integrated tandem. Additionally, the complex optical stack in a multijunction solar cell can lead to losses stemming from parasitic absorption and reflection of incident light which aggravates the current mismatch between sub&#8208;cells, thereby limiting the short&#8208;circuit current density of the tandem. Here, an integrated all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell is presented that uses surface passivation strategies to reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination at the perovskite&#8208;fullerene interfaces, yielding a high open&#8208;circuit voltage. By using optically benign transparent electrode and charge&#8208;transport layers, absorption in the narrow&#8208;bandgap sub&#8208;cell is improved, leading to an improvement in current&#8208;matching between sub&#8208;cells.

&lt;p&gt;Monolithic metal-halide perovskite tandem solar cells reach a power conversion efficiency of 23% after passivating the interfaces of the wide- and narrow-bandgap perovskites with the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; electron transport layer and minimizing the optical losses in the cell by using a hydrogenated indium oxide front contact and a thin hole transporting layers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite-based multijunction solar cells are a potentially cost-effective technology that can help surpass the efficiency limits of single-junction devices. However, both mixed-halide wide-bandgap perovskites and lead-tin narrow-bandgap perovskites suffer from non-radiative recombination due to the formation of bulk traps and interfacial recombination centers which limit the open-circuit voltage of sub-cells and consequently of the integrated tandem. Additionally, the complex optical stack in a multijunction solar cell can lead to losses stemming from parasitic absorption and reflection of incident light which aggravates the current mismatch between sub-cells, thereby limiting the short-circuit current density of the tandem. Here, an integrated all-perovskite tandem solar cell is presented that uses surface passivation strategies to reduce non-radiative recombination at the perovskite-fullerene interfaces, yielding a high open-circuit voltage. By using optically benign transparent electrode and charge-transport layers, absorption in the narrow-bandgap sub-cell is improved, leading to an improvement in current-matching between sub-cells. Collectively, these strategies allow the development of a monolithic tandem solar cell exhibiting a power-conversion efficiency of over 23%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>P&#8208;Doped NiTe2 with Te&#8208;Vacancies in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries Prevents Shuttling and Promotes Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doped NiTe2 electrocatalysts with Te&#8208;vacancies are fabricated on maize&#8208;straw carbon nanosheets to act as separators in Li&#8211;S batteries. They exhibit high conductivities and strong polysulfide adsorption, which increase redox conversions and sulfur electrochemistry.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish polysulfide conversion kinetics. Here, a P&#8208;doped nickel tellurium electrocatalyst with Te&#8208;vacancies (P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x) anchored on maize&#8208;straw carbon (MSC) nanosheets, served as a functional layer (MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x) on the separator of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. The P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x electrocatalyst enhanced the intrinsic conductivity, strengthened the chemical affinity for polysulfides, and accelerated sulfur redox conversion. The MSC nanosheets enabled NiTe2 nanoparticle dispersion and Li+ diffusion. In situ Raman and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra confirmed that the MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x restrained the shuttle effect and accelerated the redox conversion. The MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x&#8208;based cell has a cyclability of 637 mAh g&#8208;1 at 4 C over 1800 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.0139% per cycle, high rate performance of 726 mAh g&#8208;1 at 6 C, and a high areal capacity of 8.47 mAh cm&#8208;2 under a sulfur configuration of 10.2&#160;mg cm&#8208;2, and a low electrolyte/sulfur usage ratio of 3.9. This work demonstrates that vacancy&#8208;induced doping of heterogeneous atoms enables durable sulfur electrochemistry and can impact future electrocatalytic designs related to various energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Doping Control of Magnetic Anisotropy for Stable Antiskyrmion Formation in Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. It is demonstrated that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy, and subtle balance between uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, vortex&#8208;like topological spin textures, have attracted much interest in a wide range of research fields from fundamental physics to spintronics applications. Recently, growing attention is also paid to antiskyrmions emerging with opposite topological charge in non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnets with D2d or S4 symmetry. In these magnets, complex interplay among anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic dipolar interactions generates various magnetic textures. However, the precise role of these magnetic interactions in stabilizing antiskyrmions remains to be elucidated. In this work, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. The authors&#8217; magnetometry study, supported by ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, shows that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy. In particular, doping with Pd induces easy&#8208;axis anisotropy, giving rise to formation of antiskyrmions, while a temperature&#8208;induced spin reorientation is observed in an Rh&#8208;doped compound. In combination with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, the stability of antiskyrmion as functions of uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is quantitatively analyzed, and demonstrated that subtle balance between them is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.

         <title>Sulfuration of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Multianionic Redox and Stabilized Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurization of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs) can be achieved by ion&#8208;exchange reaction to incorporate sulfur atoms in the lattice structure of LLOs, while the surface polyanions&#8208;formation leads to the protecting layer. This facile and economical way to sulfurize LLO materials can provide multianionic redox and stabilized coordination environment thus for outstanding battery performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich transition metal oxides (LLOs) can deliver high specific capacity over 250 mAh g&#8722;1, stemming from additional contribution of oxygen redox. However, the formation of O(2&#8722;n)&#8722; (0 &lt; n&#160;&lt; 2) species and even oxygen gas during the deep oxidation stage leads to progressive structural transformation that cause voltage decay/hysteresis, sluggish kinetics, and poor thermostability, preventing real&#8208;world application of LLOs. Therefore, the substantive key relies on enhancing the anionic redox stability in LLOs. Here, a sulfuration procedure of LLOs (S&#8208;LLOs) is proposed, in which sulfur anions are incorporated into oxygen sites in the lattice structure and form polyanions on the surface. Proved by structural characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, sulfur anions in the interior lattice can reversibly participate in the redox process and enhance the integral coordination stability by mitigating undesired oxygen redox. Moreover, S polyanions at the surface form a protecting layer for interfacial stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that S&#8208;LLO demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 307.8 mAh g&#8722;1, an outstanding capacity retention rate of 91.5% after 200 cycles, along with excellent voltage maintenance, rate capability, and thermostability. The sulfuration process of LLOs with multianionic redox mechanism highlights a promising strategy to design novel high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials with superior cycling performance.

         <title>A Logic&#8208;Based Diagnostic and Therapeutic Hydrogel with Multistimuli Responsiveness to Orchestrate Diabetic Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel responsive to diabetic microenvironmental cues combined with the controlled delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory and osteogenic protein drugs. The logic&#8208;based drug release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects.








Abstract
The regeneration of diabetic bone defects remains challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by glucose fluctuation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and overexpression of proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual&#8208;logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel consisting of phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and gelatin colloids.

     alt="A Logic-Based Diagnostic and Therapeutic Hydrogel with Multistimuli Responsiveness to Orchestrate Diabetic Bone Regeneration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual logic-based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is developed through the design of a double-network hydrogel responsive to diabetic microenvironmental cues combined with the controlled delivery of anti-inflammatory and osteogenic protein drugs. The logic-based drug release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria-related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regeneration of diabetic bone defects remains challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by glucose fluctuation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and overexpression of proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual-logic-based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a double-network hydrogel consisting of phenylboronic-acid-crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and gelatin colloids. It exhibits a &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; logic to interpret pathological cues (glucose fluctuation, ROS, MMPs) and determines when to release drug in a diabetic microenvironment and a therapeutic logic to program different cargo release to match immune-osteo cascade for better tissue regeneration. The hydrogel is also shown to be mechanically adaptable to the local complexity at the bone defect. Furthermore, the underlying therapeutic mechanism is elucidated, whereby the logic-based cargo release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria-related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects. This study provides critical insight into the design and biological mechanism of dual-logic-based tissue-engineering strategies for diabetic bone regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Wide&#8208;Gamut Coloration at the Diffraction Limit in Flexible, Self&#8208;Assembled Hierarchical Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric structural coloration platform that simultaneously addresses all areas required for real&#8208;world commercial applications is implemented: wide colors gamut, also exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum, low manufacturing costs, large&#8208;scale printing demonstrated on entire wafers and 4 in. flexible substrates, and high printing resolutions at a constant 101&#8201;600 dots per inch.








Abstract
Unveiling physical phenomena that generate controllable structural coloration is at the center of significant research efforts due to the platform potential for the next generation of printing, sensing, displays, wearable optoelectronics components, and smart fabrics. Colors based on e&#8208;beam facilities possess high resolutions above 100k dots per inch (DPI), but limit manufacturing scales up to 4.37&#160;cm2, while requiring rigid substrates that are not flexible. State&#8208;of&#8208;art scalable techniques, on the contrary, provide either narrow gamuts or small resolutions. A common issue of current methods is also a heterogeneous resolution, which typically changes with the color printed. Here, a structural coloration platform with broad gamuts exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum in inexpensive, thermally resistant, flexible, and metallic&#8208;free structures at constant 101&#8201;600&#160;DPI (at the diffraction limit), obtained via mass&#8208;production manufacturing is demonstrated. This platform exploits a previously unexplored physical mechanism, which leverages the interplay between strong scattering modes and optical resonances excited in fully 3D dielectric nanostructures with suitably engineered longitudinal profiles. The colors obtained with this technology are scalable to any area, demonstrated up to the single wafer (4 in.). These results open real&#8208;world applications of inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution, large&#8208;scale structural colors with broad chromatic spectra.

         <title>A New Strategy for Microbial Taxonomic Identification through Micro&#8208;Biosynthetic Gold Nanoparticles and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is developed for the identification of multiple classifications of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi, from kingdom to species. The features of gold nanoparticles biosynthesized by different microorganisms are analyzed by machine&#8208;learning algorithms. The levels of glucose, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#8208;dependent reductase are related to the underlying mechanism of micro&#8208;biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles.








Abstract
Microorganisms can serve as biological factories for the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials that can become useful as nanocatalysts, energy&#8208;harvesting&#8211;storage components, antibacterial agents, and biomedical materials. Herein, the development of biosynthesis of inorganic nanomaterials into a simple, stable, and accurate strategy for distinguishing microorganisms from multiple classification levels (i.e., kingdom, order, genus, and species) without gene amplification, biochemical testing, or target recognition is reported. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) biosynthesized by different microorganisms differ in color of the solution, and their features can be characterized, including the particle size, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrum, and the surface potential. The inter&#8208;relation between the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and the classification of microorganisms are exploited at different levels through machine learning to establish a taxonomic model. This model agrees well with traditional classification methods that offers a new strategy for microbial taxonomic identification. The underlying mechanism of this strategy is related to the biomolecules produced by different microorganisms including glucose, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#8208;dependent reductase that regulate the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs. This work broadens the application of biosynthesis of inorganic materials through micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and machine learning, which holds great promise as a tool for biomedical research.

         <title>Creating a Ferromagnetic Ground State with Tc Above Room Temperature in a Paramagnetic Alloy through Non&#8208;Equilibrium Nanostructuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hitherto&#8208;unknown ferromagnetic ground state with Curie temperature above room temperature can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by non&#8208;equilibrium nanostructuring. The ferromagnetic ground state originates from surface stress&#8208;induced tetragonal distortion in the ligaments of the nanoporous network. The study demonstrates a route for reaching conventionally inaccessible magneto&#8208;electronic states and achieving an on/off ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic switching for potential applications.








Abstract
Materials with strong magnetostructural coupling have complex energy landscapes featuring multiple local ground states, thus making it possible to switch among distinct magnetic&#8208;electronic properties. However, these energy minima are rarely accessible by a mere application of an external stimuli to the system in equilibrium state. A ferromagnetic ground state, with Tc above room temperature, can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by nonequilibrium nanostructuring. By a dealloying process, bulk chemically disordered FeRh alloys are transformed into a nanoporous structure with the topology of a few nanometer&#8208;sized ligaments and nodes. Magnetometry and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy reveal the coexistence of two magnetic ground states, a conventional low&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;glass and a hitherto&#8208;unknown robust ferromagnetic phase. The emergence of the ferromagnetic phase is validated by density functional theory calculations showing that local tetragonal distortion induced by surface stress favors ferromagnetic ordering. The study provides a means for reaching conventionally inaccessible magnetic states, resulting in a complete on/off ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic switching over a broad temperature range.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Confined Printing of Programmable Organic Microcrystal Assemblies for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable organic microcrystal assemblies with dynamic tunable shapes and orientations are manufactured using a virtual, dynamic, noncontact template created by magnetic domain confined printing method. The highly reproducible shape switching enables it to be encoded into a multilevel QR code that encrypts, decrypts, and erases security information by applying a magnetic field.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale assembly of organic micro/nanocrystals into well&#8208;defined patterns with programmable structures is essential for applications such as information encryption at both high data density and high security level. Here, a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted approach that produces programmable assemblies of organic microcrystals with various shapes and orientations, using the magnetic domains of the underlying ferromagnetic metal microarrays as the printing templates, is developed. The diamagnetic microcrystals tend to aggregate in the regions of minimal field strength, and thus their assembly behavior is precisely controlled by the local field distribution on top of magnetic domains on substrate. The dynamic assembly process of microcrystal assemblies can be programmed upon the sequence of applied field, and their shape changes are &#8776;100% reproducible on a large scale (&gt;20&#8201;000 sites over 1 cm2). These features of magnetically programmable assemblies are ideally suited for information encryption, for which the encryption&#8211;decryption&#8211;erasing of multilevel information from a QR&#8208;code pattern based on the microcrystal assemblies under magnetic field is demonstrated.

Through changing mixed stacking into segregated stacking mode, triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex demonstrates a low CT degree and a small counter pitch angle between TP and F4TCNQ molecules, benefiting for breaking the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state for realizing the near&#8208;infrared emission with a maximum peak of 770 nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 5.4%.








Abstract
Harvesting the narrow bandgap excitons of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes for the achievement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission has attracted intensive attention for its fundamental importance and practical application. Herein, the triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) CT organic complex is designed and fabricated via the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process, which demonstrates the NIR emission with a maximum peak of 770&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.4%. The segregated stacking mode of TP&#8208;F4TCNQ CT complex based on the multiple types of intermolecular interaction has a low CT degree of 0.00103 and a small counter pitch angle of 40&#176; between F4TCNQ and TP molecules, which breaks the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state, resulting in the effective NIR emission. Acting as the promising candidates for the active optical waveguide in the NIR region beyond 760&#160;nm, the self&#8208;assembled TP&#8208;F4TCNQ single&#8208;crystalline organic microwires display an ultralow optical&#8208;loss coefficient of 0.060&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. This work holds considerable insights for the exploration of novel NIR&#8208;emissive organic materials via an universal &#8220;cocrystal engineering&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Controlled Activation of TRPV1 Channels on Microglia to Boost Their Autophagy for Clearance of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein and Enhance Therapy of Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugates of ultra&#8208;small Cu2&#8211;xSe nanoparticles and TRPV1 antibody can efficiently target microglia and photothermally activate their TRPV1 channels under the second near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, which promotes the efficient influx of Ca2+ to boost their autophagy. The enhanced autophagy of microglia improves the phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn and boosts the therapeutic efficacy of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized with accumulation of Lewy bodies with a major component of fibrillar alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn). Herein, boosting PD therapeutic efficacy by enhancing the autophagy of microglia to phagocytose and degrade &#945;&#8208;syn via controlled opening of their surface TRPV1 channels with rationally designed photothermal nanoagent is reported. The Cu2&#8722;xSe&#8208;anti&#8208;TRPV1 nanoparticles (CS&#8208;AT NPs) are fabricated to target the microglia and open their surface TRPV1 channels under the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) laser irradiation to cause influx of Ca2+ to activate ATG5 and Ca2+/CaMKK2/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, which promote phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn. The CS&#8208;AT NPs are efficiently delivered by focused ultrasound into striatum of PD mice with high expression of TRPV1 receptors. The athletic ability of PD mice treated by CS&#8208;AT NPs and NIR&#8208;II irradiation is significantly improved due to the phagocytotic clearance of &#945;&#8208;syn by microglia with enhanced autophagy. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, ionized calcium binding adapter protein 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and pSer129&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn (p&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn) of treated PD mice are almost recovered to the normal levels of healthy mice. This study provides insights into the activation of microglial autophagy by targeting surface ion channels to improve the treatment of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>3D Microvascularized Tissue Models by Laser&#8208;Based Cavitation Molding of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel method to generate channels in collagen hydrogels with sub&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m resolution using non&#8208;ablative cavitation&#8208;based laser patterning. These channels can be used for the direct seeding of endothelial cells to form an artificial microvasculature. Cavitation&#8208;based patterning preserves the viability of cells in the hydrogels arranged either as single cells or spheroids, enabling complex microvascularized tissue models.








Abstract
3D tissue models recapitulating human physiology are important for fundamental biomedical research, and they hold promise to become a new tool in drug development. An integrated and defined microvasculature in 3D tissue models is necessary for optimal cell functions. However, conventional bioprinting only allows the fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds containing vessel&#8208;like structures with large diameters (&gt;100&#160;&#181;m) and simple geometries. Recent developments in laser photoablation enable the generation of this type of structure with higher resolution and complexity, but the photo&#8208;thermal process can compromise cell viability and hydrogel integrity. To address these limitations, the present work reports in situ 3D patterning of collagen hydrogels by femtosecond laser irradiation to create channels and cavities with diameters ranging from 20 to 60&#160;&#181;m. In this process, laser irradiation of the hydrogel generates cavitation gas bubbles that rearrange the collagen fibers, thereby creating stable microchannels. Such 3D channels can be formed in cell&#8208; and organoid&#8208;laden hydrogel without affecting the viability outside the lumen and can enable the formation of artificial microvasculature by the culture of endothelial cells and cell media perfusion. Thus, this method enables organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and 3D tissue models featuring complex microvasculature.

         <title>Preconstructing Asymmetric Interface in Air Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries is proposed. Precise loading of the electrocatalysts at the asymmetric interface is achieved to obtain zinc&#8211;air batteries cycling at 25 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to various electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford great potential toward next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage. Nevertheless, the oxygen redox reactions at the air cathode are highly sluggish in kinetics to induce poor energy efficiency and limited cycling lifespan. Air cathodes with asymmetric configurations significantly promote the electrocatalytic efficiency of the loaded electrocatalysts, whereas rational synthetic methodology to effectively fabricate asymmetric air cathodes remains insufficient. Herein, a strategy of asymmetric interface preconstruction is proposed to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for high&#8208;performance rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, the asymmetric interface is preconstructed by introducing immiscible organic&#8211;water diphases within the air cathode, at which the electrocatalysts are in situ formed to achieve an asymmetric configuration. The as&#8208;fabricated asymmetric air cathodes realize high working rates of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, long cycling stability of 3400 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and over 100 cycles under harsh conditions of 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 25 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to many electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up. This work provides an effective strategy toward advanced asymmetric air cathodes with high electrocatalytic efficiency and significantly promotes the performance of rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions in a Thickness Tunable 2D Ferromagnet from a Defect Driven Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of skyrmions in 2D materials has opened a door to novel tunability of their magnetic structure. Here, it is shown that the chiral N&#233;el skyrmions are stabilized in the metallic 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, as a result of breaking of the inversion symmetry of its crystal structure that is derived from an asymmetric distribution of Fe atoms in alternate layers in the compound. It is found that the skyrmion size in this compound is strongly influenced by the sample thickness and changes from &#8776;100 to &#8776;700&#160;nm as the sample thickness is increased from &#8776;90&#160;nm to &#8776;2 &#181;m.








Abstract
There is considerable interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials as potential hosts for chiral skyrmionic spin textures. Of particular interest is the ferromagnetic, metallic compound Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), which has a comparatively high Curie temperature (150&#8211;220 K). Several recent studies have reported the observation of chiral N&#233;el skyrmions in this compound, which is inconsistent with its presumed centrosymmetric structure. Here the observation of N&#233;el type skyrmions in single crystals of FGT via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) is reported. It is shown from detailed X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis that FGT lacks an inversion symmetry as a result of an asymmetric distribution of Fe vacancies. This vacancy&#8208;induced breaking of the inversion symmetry of this compound is a surprising and novel observation and is a prerequisite for a Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya vector exchange interaction which accounts for the chiral N&#233;el skyrmion phase. This phenomenon is likely to be common to many 2D vdW materials and suggests a path to the preparation of many such acentric compounds. Furthermore, it is found that the skyrmion size in FGT is strongly dependent on its thickness: the skyrmion size increases from &#8776;100 to &#8776;750&#160;nm as the thickness of the lamella is increased from &#8776;90&#160;nm to &#8776;2&#160;&#181;m. This extreme size tunability is a feature common to many low symmetry ferro&#8208; and ferri&#8208;magnetic compounds.

         <title>Andreev Interference in the Surface Accumulation Layer of Half&#8208;Shell InAsSb/Al Hybrid Nanowires</title>

         <dc:description>
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. The gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al hybrid nanowires is studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field.








Abstract
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. In this letter, the gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al nanowires is studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field. Both uniform hybrid nanowires and devices featuring a short Josephson junction fabricated by shadow lithography, exhibit periodic modulation of the switching current. The period corresponds to a flux quantum through the nanowire diameter and is consistent with Andreev bound states occupying a cylindrical surface accumulation layer. The spatial distribution is tunable by a gate potential as expected from electrostatic models.

         <title>Electronic Properties and Carrier Dynamics at the Alloy Interfaces of WS2xSe2&#8722;2x Spiral Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2xSe2&#8722;2x spiral nanosheets demonstrate quadratically enhanced strong layer&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation effects. The atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images and scanning tunneling spectroscopy maps at the WS/WSe interfaces demonstrate electron scattering at the alloy interfaces at deeper energy levels, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes inferred from pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy measurements.








Abstract
Electronic properties at the interfaces between different&#8208;composition domains of 2D&#8208;alloys are key for their optical, electronic, and optoelectronic applications. Understanding the interfacial electronic structures and carrier dynamics is essential for designing and fabricating devices that use these alloys. Here, WS2xSe2&#8722;2x spiral nanosheets are prepared using the physical vapor deposition method, and the nonlinear optical and electronic properties, as well as the carrier dynamics at the interfaces between the WS and WSe domains, are studied. Second&#8208;harmonic generation tests demonstrate that these nanosheets exhibit a very strong layer&#8208;dependent nonlinear optical effect. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal that S and Se atoms are non&#8208;uniformly distributed, forming WS domains, WSe domains, and defect&#8208;related areas. Atomic STM images and STS maps reveal enhanced local density of states by electron scattering at the WS/WSe interfaces, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes observed in pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy measurements. This work provides valuable interfacial characterization of 2D&#8208;alloy materials, using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The obtained insights are likely to be useful for prospective applications.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Flux Nanoporous Graphene Membrane for Sustainable Seawater Desalination using Low&#8208;Grade Heat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin nanoporous graphene membrane is developed, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The fabrication process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes generally required for graphene membranes. In direct&#8208;contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature gradient, the membrane shows outstanding performance and holds great potential for water desalination toward a low&#8208;carbon future.








Abstract
Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development of sustainable desalination and zero&#8208;discharge processes because of its possibility of recovering 100% water and the potential for integration with low&#8208;grade heat, such as solar energy. However, the conventional membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing its practical application. Here, ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes are reported by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top edges of a highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the direct&#8208;contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair of 65/25&#160;&#176;C,&#160;the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average water flux of 421.7 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with over 99.8% salt rejection, which is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes. The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using water from the Red Sea heated under direct sunlight radiation show that the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from 8 am to 8 pm, showing a great potential for real applications in seawater desalination.

A deep&#8208;learning machine is created to segment sparse, multiclass microdamage in advanced composite laminates that feature complex microstructures and failure behavior, with &#8776;99.99% binary accuracy using 65&#160;000 tomograms in 3D X&#8208;ray datasets. The deep&#8208;learning approach accelerates heterogeneous materials knowledge creation by two orders of magnitude in a generalizable way, breaking a longstanding bottleneck while additionally introducing objectivity.








Abstract
Four&#8208;dimensional quantitative characterization of heterogeneous materials using in situ synchrotron radiation computed tomography can reveal 3D sub&#8208;micrometer features, particularly damage, evolving under load, leading to improved materials. However, dataset size and complexity increasingly require time&#8208;intensive and subjective semi&#8208;automatic segmentations. Here, the first deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation of multiclass microscale damage in heterogeneous bulk materials is presented, teaching on advanced aerospace&#8208;grade composite damage using &#8776;65&#160;000 (trained) human&#8208;segmented tomograms. The trained CNN machine segments complex and sparse (&lt;&lt;1% of volume) composite damage classes to &#8776;99.99% agreement, unlocking both objectivity and efficiency, with nearly 100% of the human time eliminated, which traditional rule&#8208;based algorithms do not approach. The trained machine is found to perform as well or better than the human due to &#8220;machine&#8208;discovered&#8221; human segmentation error, with machine improvements manifesting primarily as new damage discovery and segmentation augmentation/extension in artifact&#8208;rich tomograms. Interrogating a high&#8208;level network hyperparametric space on two material configurations, DL is found to be a disruptive approach to quantitative structure&#8211;property characterization, enabling high&#8208;throughput knowledge creation (accelerated by two orders of magnitude) via generalizable, ultrahigh&#8208;resolution feature segmentation.

         <title>Constructing Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cell with Efficiency of 22.0% via Reduced Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss and Broadened Absorption Spectra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing ClFA+ cation to reduce the voltage loss of perovskite front subcell and using chloride substitution to broaden the absorption spectra of organic rear subcell, a monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell is constructed, and the power conversion efficiency reaches 22.0%.








Abstract
Combining the high stability under UV light of the wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) and the broad near&#8208;infrared absorption spectra of the narrow bandgap (NBG) organic solar cells (OSCs), the perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as front cell and the NBG OSC as rear cell have attracted attention . However, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite/organic TSCs needs to be further improved. Herein, nonradiative charge recombination loss is reduced through bulk defect passivation in the WBG pero&#8208;SC front subcell and broadening the range of absorption spectra of the NBG OSC rear cell. For the WBG pero&#8208;SCs, an organic cation chloro&#8208;formamidinium is introduced into FA0.6MA0.4Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 to passivate the bulk defects in the perovskite film and the WBG pero&#8208;SC displays high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and high fill factor of 83.0%. For the NBG OSCs, a new infrared&#8208;absorbing organic small molecule acceptor BTPV&#8208;4Cl&#8208;eC9 is designed and synthesized. Then, a monolithic perovskite/organic TSC is fabricated with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as the front cell and the NBG OSC as the rear cell, and the TSC demonstrates high power conversion efficiency up to 22.0%. The results indicate that the perovskite/organic TSC is promising for future commercialization.

         <title>Stretchable Mesh Nanoelectronics for 3D Single&#8208;Cell Chronic Electrophysiology from Developing Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building cyborg brain organoids through the integration of stretchable mesh nanoelectronics with human induced pluripotent stem cell derived progenitors and neurons through organogenesis is reported. The stretchable mesh nanoelectronics can adapt the morphogenesis of organoids and record organoid&#8208;wide electrophysiology at single&#8208;cell, millisecond resolution, chronically and noninvasively. Emergence and evolution of single&#8208;unit action potentials over the time course of brain organoid development are measured.








Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived brain organoids have shown great potential for studies of human brain development and neurological disorders. However, quantifying the evolution of the electrical properties of brain organoids during development is currently limited by the measurement techniques, which cannot provide long&#8208;term stable 3D bioelectrical interfaces with developing brain organoids. Here, a cyborg brain organoid platform is reported, in which &#8220;tissue&#8208;like&#8221; stretchable mesh nanoelectronics are designed to match the mechanical properties of brain organoids and to be folded by the organogenetic process of progenitor or stem cells, distributing stretchable electrode arrays across the 3D organoids. The tissue&#8208;wide integrated stretchable electrode arrays show no interruption to brain organoid development, adapt to the volume and morphological changes during brain organoid organogenesis, and provide long&#8208;term stable electrical contacts with neurons within brain organoids during development. The seamless and noninvasive coupling of electrodes to neurons enables long&#8208;term stable, continuous recording and captures the emergence of single&#8208;cell action potentials from early&#8208;stage brain organoid development.

         <title>Reshaping the Tumor Immune Microenvironment Based on a Light&#8208;Activated Nanoplatform for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#160;self&#8208;supplying&#160;nanoplatform&#160;for&#160;enhancing PDT/RT and reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment exhibits effective inhibition of the growth of both primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. Light activation of hole generation can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to produce oxygen for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy, but also promotes the TAMs&#8217; polarization to M1 phenotype, and decreases the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;.








Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) always causes poor antitumor immune efficacy, prone to relapse and metastasis. Herein, novel poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) modified BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 (BFO/BWO) with a p&#8211;n type heterojunction is constructed for reshaping the immunosuppressive TME. Reactive oxygen species can be generated under light activation by the well&#8208;separated hole (h+)&#8211;electron (e&#8722;) pairs owing to the heterojunction in BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs. Interestingly, h+ can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to generate O2 for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiotherapy (RT), but also promotes tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, which is beneficial to decrease the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Importantly, such a light&#8208;activated nanoplatform, combining with RT can efficiently activate and recruit cytotoxic T lymphocytes to infiltrate in tumor tissues, as well as stimulate TAMs to M1 phenotype, dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive TME into an immunoactive one, and further boost immune memory responses. Moreover, BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs also present high performance for computed tomography imaging contrast. Taken together, this work offers a novel paradigm for achieving O2 self&#8208;supply of inorganic nanoagents and reshaping of the tumor immune microenvironment for effective inhibition of cancer as well as metastasis and recurrence.

         <title>Strain Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures Triggered by a Spin&#8208;Crossover Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered spin&#8208;crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks are deterministically assembled with other 2D materials, such as graphene or WSe2, forming van der Waals heterostructures. The strain concomitant to the spin transition clearly switches the electrical and optical properties of the 2D material. Thus, spin&#8208;crossover van der Waals heterostructures represent a new route for band engineering in low&#8208;dimensional materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide the possibility of engineering new materials with emergent functionalities that are not accessible in another way. These heterostructures are formed by assembling layers of different materials used as building blocks. Beyond inorganic 2D crystals, layered molecular materials remain still rather unexplored, with only few examples regarding their isolation as atomically thin layers. Here, the family of van der Waals heterostructures is enlarged by introducing a molecular building block able to produce strain: the so&#8208;called spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). In these metal&#8211;organic materials, a spin transition can be induced by applying external stimuli like light, temperature, pressure, or an electric field. In particular, smart vdWHs are prepared in which the electronic and optical properties of the 2D material (graphene and WSe2) are clearly switched by the strain concomitant to the spin transition.

     alt="Strain Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures Triggered by a Spin-Crossover Metal&#8211;Organic Framework"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered spin-crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks are deterministically assembled with other 2D materials, such as graphene or WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, forming van der Waals heterostructures. The strain concomitant to the spin transition clearly switches the electrical and optical properties of the 2D material. Thus, spin-crossover van der Waals heterostructures represent a new route for band engineering in low-dimensional materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide the possibility of engineering new materials with emergent functionalities that are not accessible in another way. These heterostructures are formed by assembling layers of different materials used as building blocks. Beyond inorganic 2D crystals, layered molecular materials remain still rather unexplored, with only few examples regarding their isolation as atomically thin layers. Here, the family of van der Waals heterostructures is enlarged by introducing a molecular building block able to produce strain: the so-called spin-crossover (SCO). In these metal&#8211;organic materials, a spin transition can be induced by applying external stimuli like light, temperature, pressure, or an electric field. In particular, smart vdWHs are prepared in which the electronic and optical properties of the 2D material (graphene and WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are clearly switched by the strain concomitant to the spin transition. These molecular/inorganic vdWHs represent the deterministic incorporation of bistable molecular layers with other 2D crystals of interest in the emergent fields of straintronics and band engineering in low-dimensional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple Responsive CPL Switches in an Enantiomeric Pair of Perovskite Confined in Lanthanide MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are embedded in homochiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) without any ligand passivation. Experimental results indicate that MAPbBr3 NCs adopted a chiral packing in enantiomeric MOFs by Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O bonds. The CPL of composites possesses the multiple external&#8208;stimulate responsive reversibility. 








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches have attracted widespread attention due to their potential applications in advanced information technologies. However, the design and fabrication of solid&#8208;state multiple&#8208;responsive CPL switches remain challenging. Here, through self&#8208;assembly of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), a pair of crystalline enantiomeric (P)&#8208;(+)/(M)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;EuMOF&#8835;MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;) adducts is prepared, where the achiral MAPbBr3 perovskite NCs embedded into chiral MOFs inherit the chirality of host MOFs by host&#8208;guest Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O coordination bonds, which is demonstrated by synchrotron&#8208;radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The chiral adducts show enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), good thermal stability of CPL in air, and photoswitchable CPL properties upon altering different UV irradiation. Based on two chiral emission centers and their different characteristics, reversible CPL switches are realized upon a diversity of external stimuli, for example, chemicals (water /CH3NH3Br solution) or temperatures (room temperature/high temperature). Benefiting from the extraordinary stimuli&#8208;responsive and highly reversible switchable CPL, multiple information encryptions and decryptions integrated with CPL, together with a chiroptical logic gate are successfully designed. This work opens a new avenue to generally fabricate solid&#8208;state CPL composite materials and develops new applications based on switchable CPL.

         <title>A Facile, Protein&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Theranostic Strategy for Multimodal&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic and Photothermal Immunotherapy In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature's ability to achieve molecular self&#8208;assembly, a facile, protein&#8208;derived supramolecular theranostic strategy for multimodal&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy in vivo is demonstrated.








Abstract
Theranostic systems that permit both diagnosis and treatment in vivo are highly appealing means by which to meet the demands of precision medicine. However, most such systems remain subject to issues related to complex molecular design and synthesis, potential toxicity, and possible photoactivity changes. Herein, a novel supramolecular theranostic strategy involving biomarker protein activation (BPA) and a host&#8211;guest strategy is proposed. To exemplify BPA, a facile &#8220;one&#8208;for&#8208;all&#8221; nanotheranostic agent for both albumin detection and cancer treatment is demonstrated, which utilizes a nanoparticulate heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY dye derivative (B4&#160;NPs). The fluorescence and photoactivity of BODIPY dyes are completely suppressed by aggregation&#8208;induced self&#8208;quenching in the nanoparticulate state. However, a Balb/c nude mouse model is used to confirm that following the disassembly of injected B4&#160;NPs, BODIPY specifically binds albumin in vivo, accompanied by significantly enhanced biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency. More importantly, this supramolecular host&#8211;guest BPA strategy enables the resultant nanoplatform to act as a facile and efficient strategy for photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Fabrication of Efficient Single&#8208;Emitter Plasmonic Patch Antennas by Deterministic In Situ Optical Lithography using Spatially Modulated Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new technique of direct laser etching using spatially modulated light permits deterministic and controlled positioning of single&#8208;emitters inside photonic structures, such as patch nanoantennas, while preventing any emitter photodegradation. The optical properties of the fabricated antennas are investigated; high brightness and very large increase of absorption cross&#8208;section are demonstrated.








Abstract
Single&#8208;emitter plasmonic patch antennas are room&#8208;temperature deterministic single&#8208;photon sources, which exhibit highly accelerated and directed single&#8208;photon emission. However, for efficient operation these structures require 3D nanoscale deterministic control of emitter positioning within the device, which is a demanding task, especially when emitter damage during fabrication is a major concern. To overcome this limitation, the deterministic room&#8208;temperature in situ optical lithography protocol uses spatially modulated light to position a plasmonic structure nondestructively on any selected single&#8208;emitter with 3D nanoscale control. Herein, the emission statistics of such plasmonic antennas that embed a deterministically positioned single colloidal CdSe/CdS quantum dot, which highlight acceleration and brightness of emission, are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the presented antenna induces a 1000&#8208;fold effective increase in the absorption cross&#8208;section, and, under high pumping, these antennas show nonlinearly enhanced emission.

         <title>Tough, Transparent, 3D&#8208;Printable, and Self&#8208;Healing Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;Gel (PEGgel)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient solvent strategy is proposed to enhance and refine the performance of polymer gel with a large range via using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent. Due to this unique solvent system, the obtained gel exhibits long&#8208;lasting performance (&gt;1 month), high stretchability (6000%), rapid self&#8208;healing (1&#160;min), suitable for self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuators.








Abstract
Polymer gels, such as hydrogels, have been widely used in biomedical applications, flexible electronics, and soft machines. Polymer network design and its contribution to the performance of gels has been extensively studied. In this study, the critical influence of the solvent nature on the mechanical properties and performance of soft polymer gels is demonstrated. A polymer gel platform based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent is reported (PEGgel). Compared to the corresponding hydrogel or ethylene glycol gel, the PEGgel with physically cross&#8208;linked poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) demonstrates high stretchability and toughness, rapid self&#8208;healing, and long&#8208;term stability. Depending on the molecular weight and fraction of PEG, the tensile strength of the PEGgels varies from 0.22 to 41.3 MPa, fracture strain from 12% to 4336%, modulus from 0.08 to 352 MPa, and toughness from 2.89 to 56.23 MJ m&#8211;3. Finally, rapid self&#8208;healing of the PEGgel is demonstrated and a self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuator is fabricated by 3D&#8208;printing. The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system may be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross&#8208;linked). Such a simple 3D&#8208;printable, self&#8208;healing, and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.

The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system may be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross-linked). Such a simple 3D-printable, self-healing, and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gridization&#8208;Driven Mesoscale Self&#8208;Assembly of Conjugated Nanopolymers into Luminescence&#8208;Anisotropic Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors create the photonic&#8208;crystal&#8208;directed molecular design platform through covalent gridization of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers. Via solvent&#8208;casting method, conjugated nanopolymers perform the in situ mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into 1D photonic crystals with multilayer microstructures. These photonic crystals show a high mechanical toughness, a high optical transmittance, an angle&#8208;dependent photoluminescence switching, and an ultralow waveguide loss, potential for bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Organic semiconducting emitters integrated with butterfly&#8208;mimetic photonic crystals (PhCs) are fascinating for dramatic advantages over light outcoupling efficiency and multifunctional strain sensors, as well as the key step toward electrically pumped lasers. Herein, an unprecedentedly direct mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into 1D PhCs is reported through a covalently gridization&#8208;driven approach of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers. A simple solvent&#8208;casting procedure allows for in situ self&#8208;assembly of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated nanopolymer, poly{[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]grid}&#8208;co&#8208;{[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]grid} (PODPFG), into well&#8208;defined multilayer architectures with an excellent toughness (30&#8211;40 J m&#8211;3). This ordered meso&#8208;architecture shows a typical Bragg&#8211;Snell diffraction behavior to testify the PhC nature, along with a high effective refractive index (1.80&#8211;1.88) and optical transmittance (85&#8211;87%). The PhC films also exhibit an angle&#8208;dependent blue/green photoluminescence switching, an electroluminescence efficiency enhancement by 150&#8211;250%, and an amplified spontaneous emission enhancement with ultralow waveguide loss coefficient (2.60 cm&#8211;1). Gridization of organic semiconductors offers promising opportunities for cross&#8208;scale morphology&#8208;directed molecular design in multifunctional organic mechatronics and intelligences.

         <title>Unraveling Crystallization Mechanisms and Electronic Structure of Phase&#8208;Change Materials by Large&#8208;Scale Ab Initio Simulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization mechanism of GeSb2Te4 is described via ab initio computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1000 atoms. The smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel is utilized to reveal the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order during crystallization. The connection between structural and electronic properties of the recrystallized models is studied.








Abstract
Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te (&#8220;GST&#8221;) alloys are leading phase&#8208;change materials for digital memories and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon fast crystallization, these materials form rocksalt&#8208;like phases with large structural and vacancy disorder, leading to an insulating phase at low temperature. Here, a comprehensive description of crystallization, structural disorder, and electronic properties of GeSb2Te4 based on realistic, quantum&#8208;mechanically based (&#8220;ab initio&#8221;) computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1000 atoms is provided. It is shown how an analysis of the crystallization mechanism based on the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel reveals the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order. The connection between structural and electronic properties of the disordered, as&#8208;crystallized models, which are relevant to the transport properties of GST, is then studied. Furthermore, it is shown how antisite defects and extended Sb&#8208;rich motifs can lead to Anderson localization in the conduction band. Beyond memory applications, these findings are therefore more generally relevant to disordered rocksalt&#8208;like chalcogenides that exhibit self&#8208;doping, since they can explain the origin of Anderson insulating behavior in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;doped chalcogenide materials.

         <title>Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Enables Tuning of Nanopores in Atomically Thin Graphene Membranes for Highly Selective Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membranes with precise pore size distributions are needed for efficient and selective separations for a sustainable future. Self&#8208;assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes across nanopores in atomically thin graphene membranes is shown to enable controllable size&#8208;dependent sealing of nanopores to tighten their size distribution and attenuate leakage. The enhanced membrane selectivity, without compromising water permeance, allows for desalination under forward osmosis.








Abstract
Atomically thin membranes comprising nanopores in a 2D material promise to surpass the performance of polymeric membranes in several critical applications, including water purification, chemical and gas separations, and energy harvesting. However, fabrication of membranes with precise pore size distributions that provide exceptionally high selectivity and permeance in a scalable framework remains an outstanding challenge. Circumventing these constraints, here, a platform technology is developed that harnesses the ability of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to self&#8208;assemble preferentially across larger, relatively leaky atomically thin nanopores by exploiting the lower steric hindrance of such larger pores to molecular interactions across the pores. By selectively tightening the pore size distribution in this manner, self&#8208;assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes simultaneously introduced on opposite sides of nanoporous graphene membranes is demonstrated to discriminate between nanopores to seal non&#8208;selective transport channels, while minimally compromising smaller, water&#8208;selective pores, thereby remarkably attenuating solute leakage. This improved membrane selectivity enables desalination across centimeter&#8208;scale nanoporous graphene with 99.7% and &gt;90%&#160;rejection of MgSO4 and NaCl, respectively, under forward osmosis. These findings provide a versatile strategy to augment the performance of nanoporous atomically thin membranes and present intriguing possibilities of controlling reactions across 2D materials via exclusive exploitation of pore size&#8208;dependent intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Electronegativity&#8208;Induced Charge Balancing to Boost Stability and Activity of Amorphous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability of amorphous MoSxOy via a charge&#8208;balancing strategy is reported. Co&#8208;doping of Rh and Sn with different electronegativities induces local charge redistribution, which shifts the H attacking site and HER&#8208;active sites. As a result, the co&#8208;doped amorphous catalysts outperform undoped and single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped MoSxOy.








Abstract
Amorphization is an efficient strategy to activate intrinsically inert catalysts. However, the low crystallinity of amorphous catalysts often causes high solubility and poor electrochemical stability in aqueous solution. Here, a different mechanism is developed to simultaneously stabilize and activate the water&#8208;soluble amorphous MoSxOy via a charge&#8208;balancing strategy, which is induced by different electronegativity between the co&#8208;dopants Rh (2.28) and Sn (1.96). The electron&#8208;rich Sn prefers to stabilize the unstable apical O sites in MoSxOy through charge transfer, which can prevent the H from attacking. Meanwhile, the Rh, as the charge regulator, shifts the main active sites on the basal plane from inert Sn to active apical Rh sites. As a result, the amorphous RhSn&#8208;MoSxOy exhibits drastic enhancement in electrochemical stability (&#951;10 increases only by 12&#160;mV) after 1000 cycles and a distinct activity (&#951;10: 26&#160;mV and Tafel: 30.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic solution. This work paves a route for turning impracticably water&#8208;soluble catalysts into treasure and inspires new ideas to design high&#8208;performance amorphous electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tunable Nanoscale Evolution and Topological Phase Transitions of a Polar Vortex Supercrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical simulation and X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that the stability and nanoscale evolution of the polar vortex supercrystal with 3D periodicity in the PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice under optical, thermal, and electrical stimuli, which includes the erase process of the supercrystal, the new stripe supercrystal, as well as the vortex&#8211;skyrmion topological phase transition.








Abstract
Understanding the phase transitions and domain evolutions of mesoscale topological structures in ferroic materials is critical to realizing their potential applications in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance storage devices. Here, the behaviors of a mesoscale supercrystal are studied with 3D nanoscale periodicity and rotational topology phases in a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 (PTO/STO) superlattice under thermal and electrical stimuli using a combination of phase&#8208;field simulations and X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. A phase diagram of temperature versus polar state is constructed, showing the formation of the supercrystal from a mixed vortex and a&#8208;twin state and a temperature&#8208;dependent erasing process of a supercrystal returning to a classical a&#8208;twin structure. Under an in&#8208;plane electric field bias at room temperature, the vortex topology of the supercrystal irreversibly transforms to a new type of stripe&#8208;like supercrystal. Under an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the vortices inside the supercrystal undergo a topological phase transition to polar skyrmions. These results demonstrate the potential for the on&#8208;demand manipulation of polar topology and transformations in supercrystals using electric fields. The findings provide a theoretical understanding that may be utilized to guide the design and control of mesoscale polar structures and to explore novel polar structures in other systems and their topological nature.

         <title>Boosting Continuous&#8208;Wave Laser&#8208;Driven Nonlinear Photothermal White Light Generation by Nanoscale Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;laser&#8208;driven white light emission intensity can be enhanced up to 100 folds by introducing nanoscale porosity to a silica medium doped with rare&#8208;earth ions. The process involves strong nonlinear photothermal emission, and it is promising to be used as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing.








Abstract
The irradiation of an optically absorptive medium by a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser can result in a spectral continuum emission covering both the visible and NIR regions, which is attractive for applications as continuum light sources in diverse fields. It is shown here that this NIR&#8208;laser&#8208;driven light emission can be effectively modulated with nanoscale architecture in the medium. By using porous silica as the model matrix and Yb3+ ions as the photothermally active centers, up to 100 folds increment in NIR&#8208;laser&#8208;induced emission intensity and dramatic decrease in threshold excitation density are demonstrated. It is observed that the emission intensity exhibits a strong nonlinear dependence on the power of the NIR excitation laser, featuring clear excitation power thresholds. Based on combined numerical simulation and spectral and temperature measurements, the improved broadband emission and photothermal nonlinearity are interpreted by enhanced optical energy localization around the laser spot that results in boosting the photon&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion efficiency. The use of the nonlinear photothermal emission process as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing, is further demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.

         <title>Photoresponsive Vaccine&#8208;Like CAR&#8208;M System with High&#8208;Efficiency Central Immune Regulation for Inflammation&#8208;Related Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed concept of the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM system makes a breakthrough in the treatment of inflammation&#8208;related depression. By precisely regulating inflammation in the central nervous system, this drug delivery system can exert a light&#8208;response immune regulation effect, inhibit the polarization of M1 type microglia, and produce a vaccine&#8208;like effect to prevent inflammation&#8208;related depression.








Abstract
Increasing evidence suggests that activation of microglia&#8208;induced neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of depression. Consequently, targeting the central nervous system to reduce neuroinflammation holds great promise for the treatment of depression. However, few drugs can enter the brain via a circulatory route through the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) to reach the central nervous system efficiently, which limits the pharmacological treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein, a light&#8208;responsive system named UZPM, consisting of blue&#8208;emitting NaYF4:Yb, Tm@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (UCNP@ZIF&#8208;8), photoacid (PA), and melatonin (MT) is developed to address the above issues. Meanwhile, UZPM is introduced into macrophages by functional liposomes fusion and modified with hydroxylamine groups on the cell surface. Aldehyde&#8208;modified cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein&#8208;4 (CTLA&#8208;4) is used as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting group to modify the surface of macrophages by aldehyde/hydroxylamine condensation to precisely target central M1&#8208;type microglia (CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM drug delivery system can efficiently penetrate the BBB, targeting centrally activated microglia, and thus, inhibiting the M1&#8208;type polarization of microglia, producing continuous vaccine&#8208;like anti&#8208;inflammatory effects that prevent the occurrence and development of inflammation&#8208;related depression.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Growing a Tenacious Hydrogel Coating from a Sticky Initiation Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative modification method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization from a sticky initiation layer, based on in situ interface redox mechanism, is proposed for mildly/controllably growing hydrogel coatings on practically any substrate's (natural or artificial materials)/medical device's surface regardless of surface topology and material category.








Abstract
Controllably coating the surfaces of substrates/medical devices with hydrogels exhibits great application potential, but lacks universal techniques. Herein, a new method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization (UV&#8208;SCIRP) from a sticky initiation layer (SIL) (SIL@UV&#8208;SCIRP), is proposed for growing hydrogel coatings. The method involves three key steps: 1) depositing a sticky polydopamine/Fe3+ coating on the surface of the substrates&#8208;SIL, 2) reducing Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions as active catalysts by UV illumination with the assistance of citric acid, and 3) conducting SCIRP in a monomer solution at room temperature for growing hydrogel coatings. In this manner, practically any substrate's surface (natural or artificial materials) can be modified by hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness and diverse compositions. The hydrogel coatings exhibit good interface bonding with the substrates and enable easy changes in their wettability and lubrication performances. Importantly, this novel method facilitates the smooth growth of uniform hydrogel lubrication coatings on the surface of a range of medical devices with complex geometries. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the slippery balls coated with hydrogel exhibited smooth movement within the catheter and esophagus. Hence, this method can prove to be a pioneering universal modification tool, especially in surface/interface science and engineering.

         <title>Controlled Switching of the Number of Skyrmions in a Magnetic Nanodot by Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is realized, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is non&#8208;volatile and reversible. The results open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, non&#8208;volatile, and multi&#8208;bit skyrmionic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topological swirling spin configurations that hold promise for building future magnetic memories and logic circuits. Skyrmionic devices typically rely on the electrical manipulation of a single skyrmion, but controllably manipulating a group of skyrmions can lead to more compact and memory&#8208;efficient devices. Here, an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is reported, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is non&#8208;volatile and reversible, which is crucial for multi&#8208;bit memory applications. Combined experiments and theoretical simulations reveal that the switching of skyrmion clusters is induced by the strain&#8208;mediated modification of both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and effective uniaxial anisotropy. The results not only open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, non&#8208;volatile, and multi&#8208;bit skyrmionic devices, but also offer valuable insights into the fundamental physics underlying the voltage manipulation of skyrmion clusters.

         <title>Resolving the Spatial Variation and Correlation of Hyperfine Spin Properties in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hyperfine interaction is an important spin quantum property in organic semiconductors. Exploiting the electroluminescence response of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to magnetic fields, large intra&#8208;device variations of this property exceeding &#8776;30% are resolved which are spatially correlated over characteristic lengths of 7 &#181;m. This has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic devices which rely on spin for their functionality.








Abstract
Devices that exploit the quantum properties of materials are widespread, with quantum information processors and quantum sensors showing significant progress. Organic materials offer interesting opportunities for quantum technologies owing to their engineerable spin properties, with spintronic operation and spin resonance magnetic&#8208;field sensing demonstrated in research grade devices, as well as proven compatibility with large&#8208;scale fabrication techniques. Yet several important challenges remain as moving toward scaling these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle quantum devices to larger integrated logic systems or spatially smaller sensing elements, particularly those associated with the variation of quantum properties both within and between devices. Here, spatially resolved magnetoluminescence is used to provide the first 2D map of a hyperfine spin property&#8212;the Overhauser field&#8212;in traditional organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Intra&#8208;device variabilities are found to exceed &#8776;30% while spatially correlated behavior is exhibited on lengths beyond 7&#160;&#181;m, similar in size to pixels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active&#8208;matrix OLED arrays, which has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic quantum devices.

Bioelectronics
The cyborg brain organoid platform reported by Jia Liu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2106829 features &#8220;tissue&#8208;like&#8221; stretchable mesh nanoelectronics designed to match the mechanical properties of brain organoids and to be folded by the organogenetic process of progenitor or stem cells. Long&#8208;term stable, continuous recording is enabled and the emergence of single&#8208;cell action potentials from early&#8208;stage brain organoid development can be captured. A 3D reconstructed fluorescence image of cyborg brain organoid tissue is shown. The red represents neural stem cells, the green neurons, the blue cell nuclei, and the yellow soft nanoelectronic interconnects and sensors.

All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics
Monolithic multijunction solar cells using lead&#8208;halide perovskite materials can deliver high performance at low material and processing costs. In article number 2110053, Ren&#233; A. J. Janssen and co&#8208;workers report surface&#8208;treatment and light&#8208;management strategies to reduce performance losses arising from nonradiative recombination and optical losses. The cover artwork shows the interaction of photogenerated electrons and holes at the interface between wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap sub&#8208;cells of the tandem device.

Skyrmion Clusters
An electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is realized by Zhipeng Hou, Yangfan Hu, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2107908, allowing a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is nonvolatile and reversible. These results open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, nonvolatile, and multibit skyrmionic devices.

Structural Color
A view of the large&#8208;scale assembly of structural colors by different nanoresonators is shown, as described by Andrea Fratalocchi and co&#8208;workers in article number 2108013. Each nanoresonator is deformed in all dimensions, including the vertical axis, and supports competing mechanisms of scattering and resonant light&#8211;matter interactions that yield in high&#8208;resolution, a complete gamut of colors even exceeding the red, green, and blue spectrum.

Phase&#8208;Change Memory Materials
In article number 2109139, Wei Zhang, Riccardo Mazzarello, and co&#8208;workers study the crystallization and electronic properties of the GeSb2Te4 phase&#8208;change memory material, based on ab initio simulations with more than 1000 atoms. The smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) similarity measure reveals the evolution of the crystallization process, and as&#8208;crystallized models are used to study the connection between structural and electronic properties, which is relevant to the transport behavior of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys.

Nanomedicine
The liver is the primary accumulation site for intravenously administered nanocarriers or incidental nanoparticles that gain access to the systemic circulation. Liver distribution and cellular uptake of nanoparticles by various liver cells could influence the therapeutic efficacy. Understanding nano&#8211;liver interactions is critical for the design of much safer and more effective nano&#8208;theranostics to treat diverse diseases, as discussed by Chunying Chen, Tian Xia, and Jiulong Li in article number 2106456.

The widespread exposure of nanomaterials to the body and gaining access to systemic circulation lead to nanomaterial liver accumulation. This induces cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses to NMs with various physicochemical properties. Understanding nano&#8208;liver interactions helps to develop safer nanoproducts and more effective nanomedicine.








Abstract
Nanomaterials (NMs) are widely used in commercial and medical products, such as cosmetics, vaccines, and drug carriers. Exposure to NMs via various routes such as dermal, inhalation, and ingestion has been shown to gain access to the systemic circulation, resulting in the accumulation of NMs in the liver. The unique organ structures and blood flow features facilitate the liver sequestration of NMs, which may cause adverse effects in the liver. Currently, most in vivo studies are focused on NMs accumulation at the organ level and evaluation of the gross changes in liver structure and functions, however, cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses, as well as the molecular mechanisms at cellular levels leading to effects at organ levels are lagging. Herein, the authors systematically review diverse interactions of NMs with the liver, specifically on major liver cell types including Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes as well as the detailed molecular mechanisms involved. In addition, the knowledge gained on nano&#8208;liver interactions that can facilitate the development of safer nanoproducts and nanomedicine is also reviewed.

Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green technology to use ubiquitous and intermittent sunlight. The emerging S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress and provides new insights into its general designing criteria. It starts with the challenges confronted by single photocatalyst from the perspective of energy dissipation by borrowing the common behaviors in the dye molecule. Subsequently, other problems faced by single photocatalyst are summarized. Then a viable solution for these problems is the construction of heterojunctions. To overcome the problems and mistakes of type&#8208;II and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed and the underlying reaction mechanism is summarized. Afterward, the design principles for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Following this, direct characterization techniques for testifying the charge transfer in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are presented. Finally, different photocatalytic applications of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are summarized. Specifically, this work endeavors to clarify the critical understanding on curved Fermi level in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interface, which can help strengthen and advance the fundamental theories of photocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Photocatalysis is a green technology to use ubiquitous and intermittent sunlight. The emerging S-scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state-of-the-art progress and provides new insights into its general designing criteria. It starts with the challenges confronted by single photocatalyst from the perspective of energy dissipation by borrowing the common behaviors in the dye molecule. Subsequently, other problems faced by single photocatalyst are summarized. Then a viable solution for these problems is the construction of heterojunctions. To overcome the problems and mistakes of type-II and Z-scheme heterojunctions, S-scheme heterojunction is proposed and the underlying reaction mechanism is summarized. Afterward, the design principles for S-scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S-scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Following this, direct characterization techniques for testifying the charge transfer in S-scheme heterojunction are presented. Finally, different photocatalytic applications of S-scheme heterojunctions are summarized. Specifically, this work endeavors to clarify the critical understanding on curved Fermi level in S-scheme heterojunction interface, which can help strengthen and advance the fundamental theories of photocatalysis. Moreover, the current challenges and prospects of the S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst are critically discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimensional Design and Core&#8211;Shell Engineering of Nanomaterials for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the coordination between the components and microstructures of low&#8208;dimensional core&#8211;shell structure materials represents a paradigm shift in the design of electromagnetic wave absorbents with radiation prevention and antiradar stealth functions.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption materials possess exceptionally high EM energy loss efficiency. With vigorous developments in nanotechnology, such materials have exhibited numerous advanced EM functions, including radiation prevention and antiradar stealth. To achieve improved EM performance and multifunctionality, the elaborate control of microstructures has become an attractive research direction. By designing them as core&#8211;shell structures with different dimensions, the combined effects, such as interfacial polarization, conduction networks, magnetic coupling, and magnetic&#8211;dielectric synergy, can significantly enhance the EM wave absorption performance. Herein, the advances in low&#8208;dimensional core&#8211;shell EM wave absorption materials are outlined and a selection of the most remarkable examples is discussed. The derived key information regarding dimensional design, structural engineering, performance, and structure&#8211;function relationship are comprehensively summarized. Moreover, the investigation of the cutting&#8208;edge mechanisms is given particular attention. Additional applications, such as oxidation resistance and self&#8208;cleaning functions, are also introduced. Finally, insight into what may be expected from this rapidly expanding field and future challenges are presented.

MOF&#8208;derived electrocatalysts/electrodes have excellent prospects in energy storage and conversion systems. This paper presents an in&#8208;depth review of the application of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and overall water splitting, highlighting experimental and computational results demonstrated in the literature. Recent progress in synthesis routes and strategies used to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of ZIF&#8208;67 derived electrocatalysts is explicitly discussed.








Abstract
Design and construction of low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is a challenging task in the field of catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water&#8208;splitting reaction. Then, different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt&#8208;based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF&#8208;67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal&#8208;doped carbon, noble metal&#8208;supported ZIF&#8208;67 derivatives) reported for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and the perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Solid Electrolyte with Adjustable Interphases Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;double&#8208;layer solid electrolyte is designed by using different kinds of plasticizers coupled with a polymer. Through the in situ polymerization of propylene carbonate on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, to form a protective layer, the oxidation and cycling stability of the cathode are improved. The low&#8208;voltage stability and fast ion transmission is improved by the affinity of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and poly(vinylidene fluoride).








Abstract
Increasing the energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries necessitates the stability of electrolytes under high/low voltage application and stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact. However, neither a single polymer nor liquid electrolyte can realize this due to their limited internal energy gap, which cannot avoid lithium&#8208;metal deposition and electrolyte oxidation simultaneously. Herein, a novel type of quasi&#8208;double&#8208;layer composite polymer electrolytes (QDL&#8208;CPEs) is proposed by using plasticizers with high oxidation stability (propylene carbonate) and high reduction stability (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based electrolyte composites. In&#8208;situ&#8208;polymerized propylene carbonate can function as a cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film, which can enhance the antioxidant ability. The nucleophilic substitution reaction between diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and PVDF increases the reduction stability of the electrolyte on the anodic side, without the formation of lithium dendrites. The QDL&#8208;CPEs has high ionic conductivity, an enhanced electrochemical reaction window, adjustable electrode/electrolyte interphases, and no additional electrolyte&#8211;electrolyte interfacial resistance. Thus, this ingenious design of the QDL&#8208;CPEs improves the cycling performance of a fabricated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)//QDL&#8208;CPEs//hard carbon full cell at room temperature, paving a new way for designing solid&#8208;state battery systems accessible for practical applications.

         <title>Unraveling Heat Transport and Dissipation in Suspended MoSe2 from Bulk to Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study using Raman thermometry and ab initio simulations to unravel the heat transport properties of suspended MoSe2 crystals with systematic thickness variation down to the monolayer. Monolayer films have almost the same in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity as bulk material thanks to an additional heat&#8208;carrying low&#8208;frequency mode. Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air is extremely efficient for the thinnest flakes.








Abstract
Understanding heat flow in layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals is crucial for applications exploiting these materials. Despite significant efforts, several basic thermal transport properties of TMDs are currently not well understood, in particular how transport is affected by material thickness and the material's environment. This combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study establishes a unifying physical picture of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of the representative TMD MoSe2. Thermal conductivity measurements using Raman thermometry on a large set of clean, crystalline, suspended crystals with systematically varied thickness are combined with ab initio simulations with phonons at finite temperature. The results show that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change strongly with thickness, yet the thinnest TMD films exhibit an in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity that is only marginally smaller than that of bulk crystals. This is the result of compensating phonon contributions, in particular heat&#8208;carrying modes around &#8776;0.1&#160;THz in (sub)nanometer thin films, with a surprisingly long mean free path of several micrometers. This behavior arises directly from the layered nature of the material. Furthermore, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air molecules is remarkably efficient, in particular for the thinnest crystals, increasing the apparent thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2 by an order of magnitude. These results are crucial for the design of (flexible) TMD&#8208;based (opto&#8208;)electronic&#160;applications.

         <title>Multiferroic&#8208;Enabled Magnetic&#8208;Excitons in 2D Quantum&#8208;Entangled Van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum&#8208;entangled magnetic excitons develop in a triangular multiferroic NiI2 when it goes through a second phase transition at low temperatures. In this graph of optical absorption data, the bright regions indicate where two exciton&#8208;related peaks appear below the second magnetic phase transition as indicated by the dashed line. The many&#8208;body calculations show that this exciton arises from a transition between two quantum&#8208;entangled states of Zhang&#8211;Rice triplet and Zhang&#8211;Rice singlet states.








Abstract
Matter&#8211;light interaction is at the center of diverse research fields from quantum optics to condensed matter physics, opening new fields like laser physics. A magnetic exciton is one such rare example found in magnetic insulators. However, it is relatively rare to observe that external variables control matter&#8208;light interaction. Here, it is reported that the broken inversion symmetry of multiferroicity can act as an external knob enabling magnetic excitons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiI2. It is further discovered that this magnetic exciton arises from a transition between Zhang&#8211;Rice&#8208;triplet and Zhang&#8211;Rice&#8208;singlet fundamentally quantum&#8208;entangled states. This quantum entanglement produces an ultrasharp optical exciton peak at 1.384&#160;eV with a 5 meV linewidth. The work demonstrates that NiI2 is 2D magnetically ordered with an intrinsically quantum&#8208;entangled ground state.

         <title>Highly Transparent and Self&#8208;Healable Solar Thermal Anti&#8208;/Deicing Surfaces: When Ultrathin MXene Multilayers Marry a Solid Slippery Self&#8208;Cleaning Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces, exhibiting high transparency (coated glass, transmittance &gt;77%&#160;at 550&#160;nm) and photothermal healability, are fabricated on various substrates, by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer&#8208;assembled MXene multilayers. The surface temperature rises by 31 &#176;C under 1.0 sun illumination for anti&#8208;/deicing applications, and the surface possesses self&#8208;cleaning capability to spontaneously shed waterborne and organic liquids.








Abstract
Solar anti&#8208;/deicing can solve icing problems by converting sunlight into heat. One of the biggest problems, which has long been plaguing the design of solar anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces, is that photothermal materials are always lightproof and appear black, because of the mutual exclusiveness between generating heat and retaining transparency. Herein, a highly transparent and scalable solar anti&#8208;/deicing surface is reported, which enables the coated glass to exhibit high transparency (&gt;77% transmittance at 550&#160;nm) and meanwhile causes a &gt;30 &#176;C&#160;surface temperature increase relative to the ambient environment under 1.0 sun illumination. Such a transparent anti&#8208;/deicing surface can be fabricated onto a large class of substrates (e.g., glass, ceramics, metals, plastics), by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer&#8208;assembled ultrathin MXene multilayers. Hence, the surface possesses a self&#8208;cleaning ability to shed waterborne and oil&#8208;based liquids thanks to residue&#8208;free slipping motion. Passive anti&#8208;icing and active deicing capabilities are, respectively, obtained on the solar thermal surface, which effectively prevents water from freezing and simultaneously melts pre&#8208;formed ice and thick frost. The self&#8208;cleaning effect enables residue&#8208;free removal of unfrozen water and interfacially melted ice/frost to boost the anti&#8208;/deicing efficiency. Importantly, the surface is capable of self&#8208;healing under illumination to repair physical damage and chemical degradation.

         <title>2D FeP Nanoframe Superlattices via Space&#8208;Confined Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are designed and synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess a number of unique features unavailable in conventional nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly promising as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled nanocrystal superlattices represent an emergent class of designer materials with potentially programmable functionalities. The ability to construct hierarchically structured nanocrystal superlattices with tailored geometry and porosity is critical for extending their applications. Here, 2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach induced by the Kirkendall effect, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The particle shape and the close&#8208;packed nature of Fe3O4 nanocubes as well as the interconnected carbon layer network contribute to the topochemical transformation process. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess several unique and advantageous structural features that are unavailable in conventional 3D nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly attractive for catalytic applications. As a proof of concept, such 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices are harnessed as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, the performance of which is superior to that of most FeP&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. This topochemical transformation approach is scalable and general, representing a new route of designing hierarchical superlattices with highly open features that cannot be accessible by traditional self&#8208;assembly methods.

         <title>Escalating Ferromagnetic Order via Se&#8208;Vacancies Near Vanadium in WSe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhancement of ferromagnetism is demonstrated via Se&#8208;vacancy engineering in V&#8208;doped WSe2 diluted magnetic semiconductors and the underlying mechanism is elucidated. After generation of abundant Se&#8208;vacancies via heat&#8208;treatment, butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis in the magnetoresistance curves and distinct magnetic domains are clearly observed. With state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art atomic elemental mapping and comprehensive theoretical explanation, the origin of the enhanced ferromagnetism is revealed.








Abstract
Magnetic order has been proposed to arise from a variety of defects, including vacancies, antisites, and grain boundaries, which are relevant in numerous electronics and spintronics applications. Nevertheless, its magnetism remains controversial due to the lack of structural analysis. The escalation of ferromagnetism in vanadium&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayer is herein demonstrated by tailoring complex configurations of Se vacancies (SeVac) via post heat&#8208;treatment. Structural analysis of atomic defects is systematically performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enabled by the monolayer nature. Temperature&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance hysteresis ensures enhanced magnetic order after high&#8208;temperature heat&#8208;treatment, consistent with magnetic domain analysis from magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The vanadium&#8211;Se vacancy pairing is a key to promoting ferromagnetism via spin&#8208;flip by electron transfer, predicted from density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations. The approach toward nanodefect engineering paves a way to overcome weak magnetic order in diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) for renovating semiconductor spintronics.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Treatment for Highest&#8208;Efficiency Ambient Printed Stable All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (EMIMHSO4), is employed for managing defects in printed cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) films. The EMIMHSO4 can succesfully regulate perovskite thin&#8208;film growth and strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+, which enable the achievement of the highest&#8208;efficiencies ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells, both under 1 sun illumination (20.01%, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and indoor light illumination (37.24%, 1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite is well known for its unparalleled stability at high temperatures up to 500 &#176;C and under oxidative chemical stresses. However, upscaling solar cells via ambient printing suffers from imperfect crystal quality and defects caused by uncontrollable crystallization. Here, the incorporation of a low concentration of novel ionic liquid is reported as being promising for managing defects in CsPbI3 films, interfacial energy alignment, and device stability of solar cells fabricated via ambient blade&#8208;coating. Both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements reveal that the ionic liquid successfully regulates the perovskite thin&#8208;film growth to decrease perovskite grain boundaries, strongly coordinates with the undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to decrease the energy barrier at the electron&#8208;transporting layer, and relaxes the lattice strain to promote phase stability. Consequently, ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells with power conversion efficiency as high as 20.01% under 1 sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and 37.24% under indoor light illumination (1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) are achieved; both are the highest for printed all&#8208;inorganic cells for corresponding applications. Furthermore, the bare cells show an impressive long&#8208;term ambient stability with only &#8776;5% PCE degradation after 1000 h aging under ambient conditions.

         <title>A New Durable Surface Nanoparticles&#8208;Modified Perovskite Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells from Selective Cation Exsolution under Oxidizing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major perovskite phase, m&#8208;BCFZYN&#8208;095, in BCFZYN&#8208;095 has high proton conductivity, and NiO nanoparticles on the surface effectively improve the oxygen surface exchange rate, thereby simultaneously increasing proton and oxygen ion conductivities of the BCFZYN&#8208;095 composite. Consequently, favorable peak power densities of a protonic ceramic fuel cell with the BCFZYN&#8208;095 composite cathode in H2 are obtained.








Abstract
A high&#8208;performance cathode of a protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) should possess excellent oxygen reduction reactivity, high proton/oxygen&#8208;ion/electron conductivity, and sufficient operational stability, thus requiring a delicate tuning of both the bulk and surface properties of the electrode material. Although surface modification of perovskites with nanoparticles from reducing&#8208;atmosphere exsolution has been demonstrated effective at improving the electrochemical anodic oxidation, such nanoparticles would easily re&#8208;incorporate into the perovskite lattice causing a big challenge for their application as a cathode. Here, a durable perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite cathode for PCFCs is reported, which is facilely prepared via the exsolution of nanoparticles in an oxidizing atmosphere. Through composition and cation nonstoichiometry manipulation, a precursor with the nominal composition of Ba0.95(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05O3&#8722;&#948; (BCFZYN&#8208;095) is designed, synthesized, and investigated, which, upon calcination, gives rise to the formation of a perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite comprising a major perovskite phase and a minor NiO phase enriched on the perovskite surface. The major perovskite phase enabled by the proper cation nonstoichiometry manipulation promotes bulk proton conduction while the NiO nanoparticles facilitate the oxygen surface exchange process, leading to a superior cathodic performance with a maximum peak power density of 1040&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and excellent operational stability of 400 h at 550&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Dopant Selection for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: The Case Study of Fe2O3 and CuO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning is applied to guide rational dopant selection in metal oxide photoelectrodes with improved photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. The chemical state is found to be the most significant factor for dopant selection, while dopants with stronger metal&#8211;oxygen bond and larger ionic radius are preferred for charge separation and transfer.








Abstract
Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide&#8208;based semiconductors for solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Machine learning (ML) is promising in providing predictable insights on the dopant selection for high&#8208;performing PEC systems because it can uncover correlations from the seemingly ambiguous linkages between vast features of dopants and the PEC performance of doped photoelectrodes. Herein, the authors successfully build ML model to predict the doping effect of 17 metal dopants into hematite (Fe2O3), a prototype photoelectrode material. Their findings disclose the critical parameters from the 10 intrinsic features of each dopant. The model is further experimentally validated by the coherent prediction on Y and La dopants&#8217; behaviors. Further interpretation of the ML model suggests that the chemical state is the most significant selection criteria, meanwhile, dopants with higher metal&#8211;oxygen bond formation enthalpy and larger ionic radius are favored in improving the charge separation and transfer (CST) in the Fe2O3 photoanodes. The generic feature of this ML guided selection criteria has been further extended to CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes showing improved CST by alkaline metal ions doping.

Rationally designed multifunctional polysulfide mediators based on a novel 1D &#960;&#8211;d conjugated Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D) are demonstrated as excellent cathode materials in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, realizing the adsorption&#8208;catalysis&#8208;conversion of polysulfides, and thus batteries with exceptional lifespan are delivered.








Abstract
The shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a 1D &#960;&#8211;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D, is presented as an efficient sulfur host to overcome these limitations. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D is characterized by a remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble LiPS species. Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D also acts as an effective catalyst for S reduction during the discharge process and Li2S oxidation during the charging process. In addition, the delocalization of electrons in the &#960;&#8211;d system of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D provides a superior electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer. Thus, cathodes based on Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D enable LSBs with excellent performance, for example, impressive cycling stability with over 82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 C, superior rate performance of 575 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.63 mAh cm&#8722;2 under raised sulfur loading of 6.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The strategies and advantages here demonstrated can be extended to a broader range of &#960;&#8211;d conjugated MOFs materials, which the authors believe have a high potential as sulfur hosts in LSBs.

         <title>Fabrication of Stretchable Superamphiphobic Surfaces with Deformation&#8208;Induced Rearrangeable Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable and durable superamphiphobic surface is fabricated by a simple and low&#8208;cost spray&#8208;coating method. Low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids can easily slide off the surface, even when the tensile strain of the surface is &#8805;225%.








Abstract
Stretchable superamphiphobic surfaces with a high deformation resistance are in demand to achieve liquid&#8208;repellent performance in flexible electronics, artificial skin, and textile dressings. However, it is challenging to make mechanically robust superamphiphobic coatings, which maintain their superliquid repellency in a highly stretched state. Here, a stretchable superamphiphobic surface is reported, on which the microstructures can rearrange during stretching to maintain a stable superamphiphobicity even under a high tensile strain. The surface is prepared by spray&#8208;coating silicone nanofilaments onto a prestretched substrate (e.g., cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polyisoprene) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layer as a binder. After subsequent fluorination, this surface keeps its superamphiphobicity to both water and n&#8208;hexadecane up to the tensile strain of at least 225%. The binding PDMS layer and rearrangeable structures maximize the deformation resistance of the surface during the stretching process. The superamphiphobicity and morphology of the surface are maintained even after 1000 stretch&#8211;release cycles. Taking advantage of the mentioned benefits, a liquid manipulation system is designed, which has the potential for fabricating reusable and low&#8208;cost platforms for biochemical detection and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>Active and Passive Tuning of Ultranarrow Resonances in Polaritonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field nanoscopy monitors active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas over a wide spectral range (&#8722;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1). Passive tunability can be realized by tailoring the dielectric environment of nanoantennas made of boron nitride, while reversible in situ tuning of narrow resonances is realized by placing nanoantennas on top of a graphene layer.








Abstract
Optical nanoantennas are of great importance for photonic devices and spectroscopy due to their capability of squeezing light at the nanoscale and enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions. Among them, nanoantennas made of polar crystals supporting phonon polaritons (phononic nanoantennas) exhibit the highest quality factors. This is due to the low optical losses inherent in these materials, which, however, hinder the spectral tuning of the nanoantennas due to their dielectric nature. Here, active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas is realized over a wide spectral range (&#8776;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1), monitored by near&#8208;field nanoscopy. To do that, the local environment of a single nanoantenna made of hexagonal boron nitride is modified by placing it on different polar substrates, such as quartz and 4H&#8208;silicon carbide, or covering it with layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index van der Waals crystal (WSe2). Importantly, active tuning of the nanoantenna polaritonic resonances is demonstrated by placing it on top of a gated graphene monolayer in which the Fermi energy is varied. This work presents the realization of tunable polaritonic nanoantennas with ultranarrow resonances, which can find applications in active nanooptics and (bio)sensing.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable microneedle&#8208;based extended gate field effect transistor for minimally invasive detection of sodium in the interstitial fluids and for real&#8208;time health monitoring is reported. The device exhibits excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability and enables transfer of data via Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things platforms.








Abstract
Sodium is a prominent prognostic biomarker for assessing health status, such as dysnatremia. As of now, detection and monitoring of sodium levels in the human body is carried out by means of laborious and bulky laboratory equipmentand/or by offline analysis of various body fluids. Herein, an innovative stretchable, skin&#8208;conformal and fast&#8208;response microneedle extended&#8208;gate FET biosensor is reported for real&#8208;time detection of sodium in interstitial fluids for minimally invasive health monitoring along with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability. The integration of the reported device with a wireless&#8208;data transmitter and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things cloud for real&#8208;time monitoring and long&#8208;term analysis is reported and discussed. This platform would eventually help bringing unlimited possibilities for effecient medical care and accurate clinical decision&#8208;making.

         <title>High Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution via Strong Built&#8208;In Electric Field Induced by High Crystallinity of Perylene Imide Supramolecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is successfully constructed via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding. The PDI&#8208;NH performs a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), exceeding most of photocatalysts. The high crystallinity of PDI&#8208;NH ensures the built&#8208;in electric field, acting as a kinetic force to promote the charge separation.








Abstract
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is synthesized via imidazole solvent method. The catalyst shows a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) with apparent quantum yield of 10.4% at 400&#160;nm, which is 1353 times higher than the low crystalline PDI&#8208;NH. The highly crystalline structure comes from the ordered self&#8208;assembly process in molten imidazole solvent via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding. Further, the excellent performance ascribes to the robust built&#8208;in electric field induced by its high crystallinity, which greatly accelerates the charge separation and transfer. What is more, the PDI&#8208;NH is quite stable and can be reused over 50 h without performance attenuation. Briefly, the crystalline PDI&#8208;NH with strong built&#8208;in electric field throws light on photocatalytic oxygen evolution, showing a new perspective for the design of organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Anode with an Exceptional Cycling&#8208;Induced Capacity Enhancement for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZIF glass (melt&#8208;quench Co ZIF&#8208;62 glass), for the first time, is evaluated as anode for high performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This ZIF glass anode exhibits an unusual capacity enhancement during charge&#8208;discharge cycling. This exceptional phenomenon is related to the unique structure of ZIF glass, e.g., short&#8208;range disorder.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high&#8208;energy anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium&#8208;ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it is fabricated by melt&#8208;quenching Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 (Co(Im)1.75(bIm)0.25) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&#8722;1), outstanding cycling stability, and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 and the amorphous one prepared by high&#8208;energy ball&#8208;milling. Importantly, it is found that the Li&#8208;ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge&#8211;discharge cycling and even tripled after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, reveal the origin of the cycling&#8208;induced enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, the increased distortion and local breakage of the Co&#63743;N coordination bonds making the Li&#8208;ion intercalation sites more accessible.

     alt="Metal-Organic Framework Glass Anode with an Exceptional Cycling-Induced Capacity Enhancement for Lithium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ZIF glass (melt-quench Co ZIF-62 glass), for the first time, is evaluated as anode for high performance lithium-ion batteries. This ZIF glass anode exhibits an unusual capacity enhancement during charge-discharge cycling. This exceptional phenomenon is related to the unique structure of ZIF glass, e.g., short-range disorder.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high-energy anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium-ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it is fabricated by melt-quenching Cobalt-ZIF-62 (Co(Im)&lt;sub&gt;1.75&lt;/sub&gt;(bIm)&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), outstanding cycling stability, and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt-ZIF-62 and the amorphous one prepared by high-energy ball-milling. Importantly, it is found that the Li-ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge&#8211;discharge cycling and even tripled after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, reveal the origin of the cycling-induced enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, the increased distortion and local breakage of the Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N coordination bonds making the Li-ion intercalation sites more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Minimalist Binary Vaccine Carrier for Personalized Postoperative Cancer Vaccine Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of minimalist vaccine carriers based on azole molecules&#8208;modified branched polyethylenimine is reported, which orchestrates the innate stimulating activity and antigen cross&#8208;presentation processes in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and achieves impressive personalized vaccine therapy results with the thus prepared binary vaccine.








Abstract
In recent years, significant evolutions have been made in applying nanotechnologies for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine design. However, the clinical translation of nanovaccines is still limited owing to their complicated compositions and difficulties in the spatiotemporal coordination of antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, a minimalist binary nanovaccine (BiVax) is designed that integrates innate stimulating activity into the carrier to elicit robust antitumor immunity. The authors started by making a series of azole molecules end&#8208;capped polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;M), and were&#160;surprised to find that over 60% of the PEI&#8208;M polymers have innate stimulating activity via activation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. PEI&#8208;4BImi, a PEI&#8208;M obtained from a series of polymers, elicits robust antitumor immune responses when used as a subcutaneously injected nanovaccine by simply mixing with ovalbumin antigens, and this BiVax system performs much better than the traditional ternary vaccine system, as well as, commercialized aluminum&#8208;containing adjuvants. This system also enables the fast preparation of personalized BiVax by compositing PEI&#8208;4BImi with autologous tumor cell membrane protein antigens, and a 60% postoperative cure rate is observed when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

         <title>Fully Synthetic 3D Fibrous Scaffolds for Stromal Tissues&#8212;Replacement of Animal&#8208;Derived Scaffold Materials Demonstrated by Multilayered Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of electrospun fibers and extensive amounts of porogens maximize the porosity of sub&#8208;micrometer fibrous scaffolds. The ensemble of loose fiber networks and appropriately sized pores enable the infiltration with stromal cells and the transformation to biological tissues. Thereby, the limitations of animal&#8208;derived scaffolds like decellularized tissues and hydrogels for tissue engineering applications or advanced therapy medicinal products are overcome.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) of soft tissues in vivo has remarkable biological and structural properties. Thereby, the ECM provides mechanical stability while it still can be rearranged via cellular remodeling during tissue maturation or healing processes. However, modern synthetic alternatives fail to provide these key features among basic properties. Synthetic matrices are usually completely degraded or are inert regarding cellular remodeling. Based on a refined electrospinning process, a method is developed to generate synthetic scaffolds with highly porous fibrous structures and enhanced fiber&#8208;to&#8208;fiber distances. Since this approach allows for cell migration, matrix remodeling, and ECM synthesis, the scaffold provides an ideal platform for the generation of soft tissue equivalents. Using this matrix, an electrospun&#8208;based multilayered skin equivalent composed of a stratified epidermis, a dermal compartment, and a subcutis is able to be generated without the use of animal matrix components. The extension of classical dense electrospun scaffolds with high porosities and motile fibers generates a fully synthetic and defined alternative to collagen&#8208;gel&#8208;based tissue models and is a promising system for the construction of tissue equivalents as in vitro models or in vivo implants.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Blind ZnMgO Colloidal Quantum Dot Downconverters Expand Silicon CMOS Sensors Spectral Coverage into Ultraviolet and Enable UV&#8208;Band Discrimination</title>

         <dc:description>
A nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based downconverting thin&#8208;film technology that offers a ninefold enhancement in the UV sensitivity of a silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor sensor without deteriorating its performance in the visible and near&#8208;infrared is reported. Additionally, a tandem stack of such QDs is reported, which enables UV&#8208;band discrimination in a cost effective and facile manner.








Abstract
Selective spectral detection of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is highly important across numerous fields from health and safety to industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Herein, a nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind, quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based sensing scheme that expands the spectral coverage of silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) sensors into the UV, enabling efficient UV detection without affecting the sensor performance in the visible and UV&#8208;band discrimination, is reported. This scheme uses zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) QDs with compositionally tunable absorption across UV and high photoluminescence quantum yield in the visible. The efficient luminescence and large Stokes shift of these QDs are exploited herein to act as an efficient downconverting material that enhances the UV sensitivity of Si&#8208;photodetectors (Si&#8208;PDs). A Si&#8208;PD integrated with the QDs results in a ninefold improvement in photoresponsivity from 0.83 to 7.5&#160;mA W&#8722;1 at 260&#160;nm. Leveraging the tunability of these QDs, a simple UV&#8208;band identification scheme is further reported, which uses two distinct&#8208;bandgap ZnMgO QDs stacked in a tandem architecture whose spectral emission color depends on the UV&#8208;band excitation light. The downconverting stack enables facile discrimination of UV light using a standard CMOS image sensor (camera) or by the naked eye and avoids the use of complex optics.

         <title>Synergistic Disruption of Metabolic Homeostasis through Hyperbranched Poly(ethylene glycol) Conjugates as Nanotherapeutics to Constrain Cancer Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanotherapeutic is presented for combination therapy through controllable co&#8208;delivery of doxorubicin and pyropheophorbide&#8208;a using nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) co&#8208;assembled from two hyperbranched polymer&#8208;based conjugates (HP&#8208;P and HP&#8208;D). The demonstrated tumor suppression effect can result from the reduced protein translation due to disruption of metabolic homeostasis as evidenced by metabolic variations.








Abstract
Combination therapy is a promising approach for effective treatment of tumors through synergistically regulating pathways. However, the synergistic effect is limited, likely by uncontrolled co&#8208;delivery of different therapeutic payloads in a single nanoparticle. Herein, a combination nanotherapeutic is developed by using two amphiphilic conjugates, hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) (HP&#8208;P) and hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;doxorubicin (DOX) (HP&#8208;D) to construct co&#8208;assembly nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) for controllably co&#8208;loading and co&#8208;delivering Ppa and DOX. In vitro and in vivo antitumor studies confirm the synergistic effect of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy from HP&#8208;PD NPs. Metabolic variations reveal that tumor suppression is associated with disruption of metabolic homeostasis, leading to reduced protein translation. This study uncovers the manipulation of metabolic changes in tumor cells through disruption of cellular homeostasis using HP&#8208;PD NPs and provides a new insight into the rational design of synergistic nanotherapeutics for combination therapy.

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured and Nonruptured Aneurysms Using a Semisolid Iodinated Embolic Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel semisolid gel embolization agent is presented to achieve instant occlusion of saccular aneurysms. This approach is&#160;developed, optimized, and tested in vitro, in 3D models, in vivo in rat and in porcine arterial aneurysms. Most importantly, in ruptured porcine aneurysms causing catastrophic bleeding, the gel embolic material is able to achieve instant hemostasis in survival experiments.








Abstract
Saccular aneurysms (SAs) are focal outpouchings from the lateral wall of an artery. Depending on their morphology and location, minimally invasive treatment options include coil embolization, flow diverter stents, stent&#8208;assisted coiling, and liquid embolics. Many drawbacks are associated with these treatment options including recanalization, delayed healing, rebleeding, malpositioning of the embolic or stent, stent stenosis, and even rupture of the SA. To overcome these drawbacks, a nanoclay&#8208;based shear&#8208;thinning hydrogel (STH) is&#160;developed for the endovascular treatment of SAs. Extensive in vitro testing is&#160;performed to optimize STH performance, visualization, injectability, and endothelialization in cell culture. Femoral artery saccular aneurysm models in rats and in pigs are&#160;created to test stability, efficacy, immune response, endothelialization, and biocompatibility of STH in both ruptured and unruptured SA. Fluoroscopy and computed tomography imaging consistently confirmed SA occlusion without recanalization, migration, or nontarget embolization; STH is&#160;also shown to outperform coil embolization of porcine aneurysms. In pigs with catastrophic bleeding due to SA rupture, STH is&#160;able to achieve instant hemostasis rescuing the pigs in long&#8208;term survival experiments. STH is a promising semisolid iodinated embolic agent that can change the standard of medical practice and potentially save lives.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Efficient Sequential Drug Delivery of Biomimetic Nanosystem for Multimodal Chemo&#8208;, Antiangiogenic, and Anti&#8208;MDSC Therapy in Melanoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biomimetic DS@HLipo targets the tumor site, where near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeation triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib for both antiangiogenic therapy and anti&#8208;MDSC immunotherapy. The liberated doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) from the liposomes can then be more easily ingested by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy.








Abstract
In view of the multiple pathological hallmarks of tumors, nanosystems for the sequential delivery of various drugs whose targets are separately located inside and outside tumor cells are desired for improved cancer therapy. However, current sequential delivery is mainly achieved through enzyme&#8208; or acid&#8208;dependent degradation of the nanocarrier, which would be influenced by the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, and unloading efficiency of the drug acting on the target outside tumor cells is usually unsatisfactory. Here, a light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy based on a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) and free sunitinib in the aqueous cavity, is developed. The liposomal membrane is doped with photosensitizer porphyrin&#8211;phospholipid (PoP) and hybridized with red blood cell membrane to confer biomimetic features. Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeabilization triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib (100% release in 5&#160;min) for antiangiogenic therapy and also myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) inhibition to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Subsequently, the small&#8208;sized DOX&#8208;NP liberated from the liposomes is more easily uptaken by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy. RNA sequencing and immune&#8208;related assay indicates therapeutic immune enhancement. This light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy demonstrates the potency in cancer multimodal therapy against multiple targets in different spatial positions in tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Modulating Tumor Extracellular Matrix by Simultaneous Inhibition of Two Cancer Cell Receptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin pathways with recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates treatment improves the tumor accumulation and cellular internalization of drug through regulating the F&#8208;actin content in cancer cells and extracellular matrix in the tumor environments as well as the physical environment of tumors, leading to an improved tumor therapy compared to free drug.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in fundamental cellular processes and pathological progression of many diseases. While most research and current knowledge focuses on the processes of biological and mechanical changes in ECM signaling residing cancer cells to respond, little is known of the converse&#8211;of how cancer cells initiate the changes of ECM properties. Here, it is reported that blocking the cancer cell signaling leads to disruption of tumor ECM. Using recombinant proteins (RPs) and recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates (RPDCs) that simultaneously target both epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin, it is demonstrated that multireceptor&#8208;mediated active modulation of tumor ECM can inhibit and even reverse tumor remodeling of the physiological and structural microenvironment. These results not only provide insights into the regulatory roles of cancer cells in developing a protumoral microenvironment, but also introduce a new therapeutic platform or strategy to treat cancers.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Nanophotonic Structures for High&#8208;Performance SEIRA Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of high&#8208;performance nanophotonic surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) sensor employing liquid gallium as the ground plane of nanopatch antennas is demonstrated. Superior performance for sensing thin analyte films such as monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol is achieved. The developed cost&#8208;effective procedure for realizing such liquid&#8208;gallium&#8208;based nanophotonic SEIRA sensors is suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy can provide label&#8208;free, nondestructive detection and identification of analytes with high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore has been widely used for various sensing applications. SEIRA sensors usually employ resonant nanophotonic structures, which can substantially enhance the electric field and hence light&#8211;matter interactions by orders of magnitude in certain nanoscale hot spots of the devices. However, as ever, smaller hot spots are employed to further enhance the field, the delivery of analytes into such hot spots becomes increasingly challenging. Here, high&#8208;performance nanophotonic SEIRA sensors based on nanopatch antennas with a liquid gallium ground plane are demonstrated, which not only lead to ultrahigh field confinement and enhancement, but also allow for convenient and efficient delivery of analytes into nanometric hot spots by employing a simple procedure suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The sensors exhibit superior sensitivity in the midinfrared spectral region. Around 10% molecular vibrational signals (i.e., the modulation of a sensor's reflection spectrum owing to the molecular vibrational modes of the analytes) near 2900&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;are achieved from sensing monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol. This cost&#8208;effective and reliable method for realizing liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanophotonic structures provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance sensors and other photonics applications in the infrared region.

         <title>PEG&#8208;Like Brush Polymer Conjugate of RNA Aptamer That Shows Reversible Anticoagulant Activity and Minimal Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a path is offered to rescuing RNA therapeutics from the deleterious immune side effects of PEG that induces life&#8208;threatening hypersensitivity reactions upon reactivity toward PEG antibodies using a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like stealth polymer conjugate technology. These results breathe new life into an established and valuable drug delivery technology facing an impasse.








Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics are an emerging class of drugs. RNA aptamers are of significant therapeutic and clinical interest because their activity can be easily reversed in vivo&#8212;a useful feature that is difficult to achieve using other therapeutic modalities. Despite their therapeutic promise, RNA aptamers are limited by their poor blood circulation. The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to RNA aptamers addresses this limitation. However, an RNA aptamer&#8208;PEG conjugate that is a reversible anticoagulant fails in a clinical trial due to the reactivity of the conjugate with pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies and has cast a pall over PEGylation of aptamers and other biologics, despite its long history of utility in drug delivery. Here, PEG antibody&#8208;reactivity of this RNA aptamer is eliminated by conjugating it to a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like brush polymer&#8212;poly[(oligoethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)] (POEGMA). The conjugate retained the drug's therapeutic action and the ability to be easily reversed. Importantly, this conjugate does not bind pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies that are prevalent in humans and does not induce a humoral immune response against the polymer itself in mice. These findings suggest a path to rescuing the PEGylation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines from the deleterious side&#8208;effects of PEG.

         <title>A Universal Ternary&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Ink Strategy toward Efficient Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally&#8208;friendly ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink system with excellent printability and film&#8208;forming ability is tailor&#8208;made for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). A record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs for the first time.








Abstract
Toward next&#8208;generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high&#8208;quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology toward practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX3) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs. With this tailor&#8208;made ternary halogen&#8208;free solvent (naphthene, n&#8208;tridecane, and n&#8208;nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX3 QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film&#8208;forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and n&#8208;tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43&#160;883.39&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system&#8208;based devices (EQE = 2.26%). Moreover, the ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet&#8208;printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)&#8208;based QLEDs. This work demonstrates a new strategy for tailor&#8208;making a general ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;QD&#8208;ink system for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs as well as the other solution&#8208;processed electronic devices in the future.

         <title>Nonvolatile Ferroelectric&#8208;Domain&#8208;Wall Memory Embedded in a Complex Topological Domain Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype memory based on conductive ferroelectric domain&#8208;walls confined in a topological quadrant domain is demonstrated, which exhibits a resistive&#8208;switching characteristic with a large on/off ratio &gt;104&#160;and high readout current, as well as an excellent endurance over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention over 12&#160;days.








Abstract
The discovery and precise manipulation of atomic&#8208;size conductive ferroelectric domain walls offers new opportunities for a wide range of prospective electronic devices, and the emerging field of walltronics. Herein, a highly stable and fatigue&#8208;resistant nonvolatile memory device is demonstrated, which is based on deterministic creation and erasure of conductive domain walls that are geometrically confined in a topological domain structure. By introducing a pair of delicately designed coaxial electrodes onto the epitaxial BiFeO3&#160;film, a center&#8208;type quadrant topological domain with conductive charged domain walls can be easily created. More importantly, reversible switching of the quadrant domain between the convergent state with highly conductive confined walls and the divergent state with insulating confined walls can be realized, resulting in an apparent resistance change with a large on/off ratio of &gt;104&#160;and a technically preferred readout current (up to 40&#160;nA). Owing to restrictions from the clamped quadrant ferroelastic domain, the device exhibits excellent restoration repeatability over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention of over 12&#160;days (&gt;106&#160;s). These results provide a new pathway toward high&#8208;performance ferroelectric&#8208;domain&#8208;wall memory, which may spur extensive interest in exploring the immense potential in the emerging field of walltronics.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance In&#8208;Memory Photodetector Realized by Charge Storage in a van der Waals MISFET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;memory photodetector is successfully designed based on a WSe2/h&#8208;BN/SiO2 van der Waals heterostructure, which demonstrates not only an ultrahigh photoresponsivity (337.8 A W&#8722;1) but also an extremely long&#8208;term retention (&gt;10 years). Moreover, the working mechanism with charge&#8208;storage effect of the h&#8208;BN/SiO2 structure is proved through a novel in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy analysis.








Abstract
The emerging data&#8208;intensive applications in optoelectronics are driving innovation toward the fused integration of sensing, memory, and computing to break through the restrictions of the von Neumann architecture. However, the present photodetectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunctions required in single devices. Here, a novel route for the integration of non&#8208;volatile memory into a photodetector is proposed, with a WSe2/h&#8208;BN van der Waals heterostructure on a Si/SiO2 substrate to realize in&#8208;memory photodetection. This photodetector exhibits an ultrahigh readout photocurrent of 3.4 &#181;A and photoresponsivity of 337.8 A W&#8722;1 in the solar&#8208;blind wavelength region, together with an extended retention time of more than 10 years. Furthermore, the charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based non&#8208;volatile mechanism of h&#8208;BN/SiO2 is successfully proven through a novel analysis of in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. These results represent a leap forward to future applications and insightful mechanisms of in&#8208;memory photodetection.

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional chemiresistive gas sensor composed of nanofiber yarn sputter&#8208;deposited with indium tin oxide (ITO) as a sensing layer is designed, and then coated with zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for nanofiltration of gas analytes. Through comprehensive sensing experiments and molecular modeling, it is demonstrated that yarn@ITO@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits highly sensitive and selective sensing properties toward NO at room temperature with accelerated responding speeds.








Abstract
Though highly promising as powerful gas sensors, oxide semiconductor chemiresistors have low surface reactivity, which limits their selectivity, sensitivity, and reaction kinetics, particularly at room temperature (RT) operation. It is proposed that a hybrid design involving the nanostructuring of oxides and passivation with selective gas filtration layers can potentially overcome the issues with surface activity. Herein, unique bi&#8208;stacked heterogeneous layers are introduced; that is, nanostructured oxides covered by conformal nanoporous gas filters, on ultrahigh&#8208;density nanofiber (NF) yarns via sputter deposition with indium tin oxide (ITO) and subsequent self&#8208;assembly of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals. The NF yarn composed of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;coated ITO films can offer heightened surface activity at RT because of high porosity, large surface area, and effective screening of interfering gases. As a case study, the hybrid sensor demonstrated remarkable sensing performances characterized by high NO selectivity, fast response/recovery kinetics (&gt;60&#8208;fold improvement), and large responses (12.8&#8208;fold improvement @ 1&#160;ppm) in comparison with pristine yarn@ITO, especially under highly humid conditions. Molecular modeling reveals an increased penetration ratio of NO over O2 to the ITO surface, indicating that NO oxidation is reliably prevented and that the secondary adsorption sites provided by the ZIF&#8208;8 facilitate the adsorption/desorption of NO, both to and from ITO.

         <title>A Stiffness&#8208;Switchable, Biomimetic Smart Material Enabled by Supramolecular Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stiffness&#8208;changing biomimetic smart material is developed through a unique water&#8211;ethanol solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;induced supramolecular reconfiguration strategy. The dynamic switchable supramolecular network imparts the material with an interesting self&#8208;regulation behavior in mechanical properties between soft and hard states, self&#8208;healing capability, and excellent formability, which holds great application potential in smart buildings, personal protection devices, soft robots, intelligent devices, and beyond.








Abstract
In nature, stiffness&#8208;changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials. Here, a stiffness&#8208;changing smart material, through developing interchangeable supramolecular configurations inspired from the dermis of the sea cucumber, which shows extreme, switchable mechanical properties, is reported. In the hydrated state, the material, possessing a stretched, double&#8208;stranded supramolecular network, showcases a soft&#8208;gel behavior with a low stiffness and high pliability. Upon the stimulation of ethanol to transform into the coiled supramolecular configuration, it self&#8208;adjusts to a hard state with nearly 500&#8208;times enhanced stiffness from 0.51&#160;to 243.6&#160;MPa, outstanding load&#8208;bearing capability (over 35&#160;000&#160;times its own weight), and excellent puncture/impact resistance with a specific impact strength of &#8776;116&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 (g&#160;cm&#8722;3)&#8722;1 (higher than some metals and alloys such as aluminum, and even comparable to the commercially available protective materials such as D3O and Kevlar). Moreover, this material demonstrates reconfiguration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing behavior and designable formability, holding great promise in advanced engineering fields that require both high&#8208;strength durability and good formability. This work may open up a new perspective for the development of self&#8208;regulating materials from supramolecular&#8208;scale configuration regulation.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Coordinated High&#8208;Performance Moisture Power in Natural Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient sunlight&#8208;coordinated &#8220;moist&#8208;electric generator&#8221; offers a record&#8208;high short&#8208;circuit current density, harvesting multiple sources of moisture and light synchronously, which is available for scalable integration toward portable and wearable power&#8208;supply systems under different real natural conditions, working for lighting and electrically driven objects.








Abstract
It is a challenge to spontaneously harvest multiple clean sources from the environment for upgraded energy&#8208;converting systems. The ubiquitous moisture and sunlight in nature are attractive for sustainable power generation especially. A high&#8208;performance light&#8208;coordinated &#8220;moist&#8208;electric generator&#8221; (LMEG) based on the rational combination of a polyelectrolyte and a phytochrome is herein developed. By spontaneous adsorption of gaseous water molecules and simultaneous exposure to sunlight, a piece of 1 cm2 composite film offers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.92&#160;V and a considerable short&#8208;circuit current density of up to 1.55&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This record&#8208;high current density is about two orders of magnitude improvement over that of most conventional moisture&#8208;enabled systems, which is caused by moisture&#8208;induced charge separation accompanied with photoexcited carrier migration, as confirmed by a dynamic Monte Carlo device simulation. Flexible devices with customizable size are available for large&#8208;scale integration to effectively work under a wide range of relative humidity (about 20&#8211;100%), temperature (10&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C), and light intensity (30&#8211;200&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The wearable and portable LMEGs provide ample power supply in natural conditions for indoor and outdoor electricity&#8208;consuming systems. This work opens a novel avenue to develop sustainable power generation through collecting multiple types of natural energy by a single hybrid harvester.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Growth of Amorphous Discharge Products toward an Ultrawide Band Light&#8208;Assisted Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for an ultrawide band photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed. The bifunctional Ag/Bi2MoO6 cathode is favorable to promoting the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics due to the discharge products is amorphous Li2O2. The reaction mechanism is revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. 








Abstract
Photoassisted electrochemical reaction is regarded as an effective approach to reduce the overpotential of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. However, the achievement of both broadband absorption and long term battery cycling stability are still a formidable challenge. Herein, an oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for a photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed with a silver/bismuth molybdate (Ag/Bi2MoO6) hybrid cathode. The cathode can offer both double advantages for light absorption covering UV to visible region and excellent electrochemical activity for O2. Upon discharging, the photoexcited electrons from Ag nanoplate based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are injected into the oxygen vacancy in Bi2MoO6. The fast oxygen reaction kinetics generate the amorphous Li2O2, and the discharge plateau is improved to 3.05&#160;V. Upon charging, the photoexcited holes are capable to decompose amorphous Li2O2 promptly, yielding a very low charge plateau of 3.25&#160;V. A first cycle round&#8208;trip efficiency is 93.8% and retention of 70% over 500 h, which is the longest cycle life ever reported in photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries. This work offers a general and reliable strategy for boosting the electrochemical kinetics by tailoring the crystalline of Li2O2 with wide&#8208;band light.

Inspired by the natural responsivity of active biomaterials, laser information encoding is demonstrated by exploiting enzyme&#8208;bioactive hydrogel materials confined in a microcavity. Tunable lasing wavelengths are achieved by manipulating the biological activity and nanostructures in hydrogel droplets. This study represents the first development of a biologically controlled laser for optical information applications.








Abstract
Microscale laser emissions have emerged as a promising approach for information encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting for their feature&#8208;rich spectra and high sensitivity to the surrounding environment. Compared with artificial materials, natural responsive biomaterials enable a higher level of complexity and versatile ways for tailoring optical responses. However, precise control of lasing wavelengths and spatial locations with biomolecules remains a huge challenge. Here, a biologically programmable laser, in which the lasing can be manipulated by biomolecular activities at the nanoscale, is developed. Tunable lasing wavelengths are achieved by exploiting the swelling properties of enzyme&#8208;responsive hydrogel droplets in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavity. Both experimental and theoretical means demonstrate that inner 3D network structures and external curvature of the hydrogel droplets lead to different lasing thresholds and resonance wavelengths. Finally, inkjet&#8208;printed multiwavelength laser encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are showcased under different scalabilities and environments. Hyperspectral laser images are utilized as an advanced feature for a higher level of security. The biologically encoded laser will provide a new insight into the development of biosynthetic and bioprogrammable laser devices, offering new opportunities for secure communication and smart sensing.

         <title>Synthetic Matrix Scaffolds Engineer the In Vivo Tumor Immune Microenvironment for Immunotherapy Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor growth dynamics and reproducibility of preclinical breast cancer models are improved utilizing a system leveraging synthetic material scaffolds. These scaffolds induce reliable tumor formation and programmable immune infiltration based on composition, enabling enhanced consistency and relevance to human disease. Various immunotherapeutic strategies are tested, revealing differential efficacy based on immune milieu, demonstrating the promise to improve clinical immunotherapy applications.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most powerful anti&#8208;cancer therapies but is stymied by the limits of existing preclinical models with respect to disease latency and reproducibility. Additionally, the influence of differing immune microenvironments within tumors observed clinically and associated with immunotherapeutic resistance cannot be tuned to facilitate drug testing workflows without changing model system or laborious genetic approaches. To address this testing platform gap in the immune oncology drug development pipeline, the authors deploy engineered biomaterials as scaffolds to increase tumor formation rate, decrease disease latency, and diminish variability of immune infiltrates into tumors formed from murine mammary carcinoma cell lines implanted into syngeneic mice. By altering synthetic gel formulations that reshape infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, responsiveness of the same tumor model to varying classes of cancer immunotherapies, including in situ vaccination with a molecular adjuvant and immune checkpoint blockade, diverge. These results demonstrate the significant role the local immune microenvironment plays in immunotherapeutic response. These engineered tumor immune microenvironments therefore improve upon the limitations of current breast tumor models used for immune oncology drug screening to enable immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments underlying immunotherapeutic resistance seen in human patients.

         <title>Engineering Radiosensitizer&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Advanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy suffers from high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome these limitations, a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network is engineered to achieve a synergy of radiosensitization and stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation. This tactic promotes dendritic cell maturation and evokes potent systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a mainstay of first&#8208;line cancer treatment, suffers from its high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The synergy between radiosensitization and immunomodulation may overcome these obstacles for advanced radiotherapy. Here, the authors propose a radiosensitization cooperated with stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway activation strategy by fabricating a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network, NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4@PEG&#8208;polyphenol/Mn (DSPM). The amphiphilic PEG&#8208;polyphenol successfully coordinates with NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4 (radiosensitizer) and Mn2+ via robust metal&#8208;phenolic coordination. After cell internalization, the pH&#8208;responsive disassembly of DSPM triggers the release of their payloads, wherein radiosensitizer sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray and Mn2+ promote STING pathway activation. This radiosensitizer&#8208;based DSPM remarkably benefits dendritic cell maturation, anticancer therapeutics in primary tumors, accompanied by robust systemic immune therapeutic performance against metastatic tumors. Therefore, a powerful radiosensitization with STING pathway activation mediated immunostimulation strategy is highlighted here to optimize cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Assembly of Bioactive Nanoparticles via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Complexation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and tunable strategy is developed to assemble a range of biomacromolecules into bioactive metal&#8211;phenolic nanoparticles (b&#8208;MPN NPs), while retaining the intrinsic activity of the biomacromolecules. The bioactivity of the b&#8208;MPN NPs enables their use in various applications, including cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, cascade reactions, and gene silencing.








Abstract
The integration of bioactive materials (e.g., proteins and genes) into nanoparticles holds promise in fields ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. However, it is challenging to develop a simple and broadly applicable nanoparticle platform that can readily incorporate distinct biomacromolecules without affecting their intrinsic activity. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic assembly approach is presented whereby diverse functional nanoparticles can be readily assembled in water by combining various synthetic and natural building blocks, including poly(ethylene glycol), phenolic ligands, metal ions, and bioactive macromolecules. The assembly process is primarily mediated by metal&#8211;phenolic complexes through coordination and hydrophobic interactions, which yields uniform and spherical nanoparticles (mostly &lt;200&#160;nm),&#160;while preserving the function of the incorporated biomacromolecules (siRNA and five different proteins used). The functionality of the assembled nanoparticles is demonstrated through cancer cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, catalysis, and gene downregulation studies. Furthermore, the resulting nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for the secondary engineering of superstructures via templating and cross&#8208;linking with metal ions. The bioactivity and versatility of the platform can potentially be used for the streamlined and rational design of future bioactive materials.

         <title>Novel Oligomer Enables Green Solvent Processed 17.5% Ternary Organic Solar Cells: Synergistic Energy Loss Reduction and Morphology Fine&#8208;Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low energy loss ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve significantly improved power conversion efficiencies of 17.54% and 17.32% by introducing novel oligomers with higher HOMO level as third&#8208;components, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs by green solvent. The significance of high electroluminescence quantum efficiency is highlighted and new understanding of energy loss mechanisms is provided toward high&#8208;performance, ecofriendly OSCs.








Abstract
The large non&#8208;radiative recombination is the main factor that limits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two novel structurally similar oligomers (named 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D and A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration are synthesized for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination in OSCs. Although the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers enabled ultra&#8208;high electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of 0.05% and improved VOC, indicating suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP&#8208;BO4Cl fine&#8208;tunes the active layer morphology with synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTPBO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art OSCs processed by green solvent of o&#8208;xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance in ternary OSCs. This is the first work that demonstrates novel structurally compatible D&#8208;A type oligomers are effective third components, and provides new understanding of synergetic energy loss mechanisms towards high performance OSCs.

Although the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers enabled ultra-high electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.05% and improved &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;, indicating suppressing non-radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP-BO4Cl fine-tunes the active layer morphology with synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTPBO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP-BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state-of-the art OSCs processed by green solvent of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance in ternary OSCs. This is the first work that demonstrates novel structurally compatible D-A type oligomers are effective third components, and provides new understanding of synergetic energy loss mechanisms towards high performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Porous Fibrous Scaffolds
The dimensions of electrospun fibers are predestined for synthetic replacement of extracellular matrix structures. In article number 2106780, Tobias Weigel and co&#8208;workers generate highly porous electrospun scaffolds, featuring an ensemble of loose fibers and pores of appropriate size to enable applications in engineering animal&#8208;free 3D biomedical tissues. The mechanical properties and structural composition describe a tradeoff between current synthetic porous scaffolds and animal&#8208;derived hydrogels, which are deployed as electrospun&#8208;based multilayered skin equivalents.

Thin Films
When thinning down silicon films toward nanometer thickness, their thermal conductivity decreases dramatically. In article number 2108352, Klaas&#8208;Jan Tielrooij and co&#8208;workers report a combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study that shows that this is not the case for the layered semiconductor MoSe2. For the thinnest MoSe2 films, the decreasing thermal conductivity is compensated by low&#8208;energy, long&#8208;mean&#8208;free&#8208;path heat&#8208;carrying modes. These thin films furthermore exhibit efficient heat dissipation to air molecules.

Multiferroic Materials
In article number 2109144, Jae Hoon Kim, Je&#8208;Geun Park, and co&#8208;workers report a new exciton in multiferroic NiI2, consisting of a 2D triangular lattice. This newly discovered exciton is not only magnetic but also quantum entangled. When an electron and hole combine via a transition between two quantum&#8208;entangled states, it produces a bright reddish light of 1.384 eV.

Endovascular Treatment
In article number 2108266, Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers report an endovascular treatment for ruptured saccular aneurysms. In the cover image, blue represents the catheter inside the artery releasing the shear thinning hydrogel (in yellow) inside the aneurysm sac, rapidly achieving hemostasis. The magnified image of the hydrogel demonstrates its structure, with the dark brown spots indicating iodine. The inset in the lower right demonstrates rapid healing of the aneurysm neck and the fibroinflammatory response to the hydrogel leading the fibrotic replacement of the biomaterial.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2105869, Jihan Kim, Il&#8208;Doo Kim, and co&#8208;workers present a multifunctional chemiresistive gas sensor composed of nanofiber yarn sputter deposited with an oxide sensing layer, and then coated with ZIF&#8208;8 for nanofiltration of gas analytes. Through comprehensive sensing experiments and molecular modeling, they demonstrate that this concept of introducing bistacked oxide/molecular sieve heterostructured layers on the yarn platform guarantees improved surface activity and selective molecular transport in a free&#8208;standing sensor.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Materials: The Turning Point of Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of organic photovoltaics has been significantly aided by the emergence of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) materials, and they are also able to satisfy the varied criteria for various types of organic photovoltaic device architectures. Furthermore, the absorption window is the most fundamental criterion for developing novel NIR organic photoelectric materials.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing organic semiconductors have opened up many exciting opportunities for organic photovoltaic (OPV) research. For example, new chemistries and synthetical methodologies have been developed; especially, the breakthrough Y&#8208;series acceptors, originally invented by our&#160;group, specifically Y1, Y3, and Y6, have contributed immensely to boosting single&#8208;junction solar cell efficiency to around 19%; novel device architectures such as tandem and transparent organic photovoltaics have been realized. The concept of NIR donors/acceptors thus becomes a turning point in the OPV field. Here, the development of NIR&#8208;absorbing materials for OPVs is reviewed. According to the low&#8208;energy absorption window, here, NIR photovoltaic materials (p&#8208;type (polymers) and n&#8208;type (fullerene and nonfullerene)) are classified into four categories: 700&#8211;800 nm, 800&#8211;900 nm, 900&#8211;1000 nm, and greater than 1000&#160;nm. Each subsection covers the design, synthesis, and utilization of various types of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units. The structure&#8211;property relationship between various kinds of D, A units and absorption window are constructed to satisfy requirements for different applications. Subsequently, a variety of applications realized by NIR materials, including transparent OPVs, tandem OPVs, photodetectors, are presented. Finally, challenges and future development of novel NIR materials for the next&#8208;generation organic photovoltaics and beyond are discussed.

Materials chemistry plays a crucial role in determining the interaction and integration of these devices with biological systems. Recent progress in materials chemistry&#8208;enabled bioelectronics is presented and challenges, opportunities, and future research directions are highlighted.








Abstract
Designing bioelectronic devices that seamlessly integrate with the human body is a technological pursuit of great importance. Bioelectronic medical devices that reliably and chronically interface with the body can advance neuroscience, health monitoring, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Recent major efforts focus on investigating strategies to fabricate flexible, stretchable, and soft electronic devices, and advances in materials chemistry have emerged as fundamental to the creation of the next generation of bioelectronics. This review summarizes contemporary advances and forthcoming technical challenges related to three principal components of bioelectronic devices: i) substrates and structural materials, ii) barrier and encapsulation materials, and iii) conductive materials. Through notable illustrations from the literature, integration and device fabrication strategies and associated challenges for each material class are highlighted.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free Click Chemistry: Applications in Drug Delivery, Cell Tracking, and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;free click chemistry is applicable outside of the laboratory, as it can be used controllably on cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. It is consequently of interest to biomedical researchers, and various new materials have been proposed. They can be categorized as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering.








Abstract
Traditionally, organic chemical reactions require organic solvents, toxic catalysts, heat, or high pressure. However, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has been shown to have favorable reaction rates and orthogonality in water, buffer solutions, and physiological conditions without toxic catalysts. Strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition and inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are representative of copper&#8208;free click chemistry. Artificial chemical reactions via click chemistry can also be used outside of the laboratory in a controllable manner on live cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. Consequently, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has many features that are of interest in biomedical research, and various new materials and strategies for its use have been proposed. Herein, recent remarkable trials that have used copper&#8208;free click chemistry are described, focusing on their applications in molecular imaging and therapy. The research is categorized as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering, which are rapidly advancing fields based on click chemistry. The content is based primarily on the experience with click chemistry&#8208;based biomaterials over the last 10 years.

         <title>Colloidal Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets: Thickness&#8208;Controlled Synthesis, Properties, and Application in Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the research progress and challenges associated with thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, stability, surface passivation, doping, optical (linear and nonlinear) properties of both organic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid lead and lead&#8208;free halide perovskite nanoplatelets along with recent progress on their application to light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Colloidal metal&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (MHP NCs) are gaining significant attention for a wide range of optoelectronics applications owing to their exciting properties, such as defect tolerance, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range. Although the optical properties of MHP NCs are easily tunable through their halide composition, they suffer from light&#8208;induced halide phase segregation that limits their use in devices. However, MHPs can be synthesized in the form of colloidal nanoplatelets (NPls) with monolayer (ML)&#8208;level thickness control, exhibiting strong quantum confinement effects, and thus enabling tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range by controlling the thickness of bromide or iodide&#8208;based lead&#8208;halide perovskite NPls. In addition, the NPls exhibit narrow emission peaks, have high exciton binding energies, and a higher fraction of radiative recombination compared to their bulk counterparts, making them ideal candidates for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in colloidal MHP NPls: synthetic routes, thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis of both organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid and all&#8208;inorganic MHP NPls, their linear and nonlinear optical properties (including charge&#8208;carrier dynamics), and their performance in LEDs. Furthermore, the challenges associated with their thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, environmental and thermal stability, and their application in making efficient LEDs are discussed.

         <title>Stabilization of Metastable Halide Perovskite Lattices in the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects of metastability in halide perovskites, especially the phase stabilization in the 2D limit due to the dominance of surface effects, are critically reviewed. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which provide new insights on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites constitute a new class of semiconductors that are structurally tailorable, exhibiting rich structural polymorphs. In this perspective, the polymorphism in lead halide perovskites is described&#8212;a material system currently used for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Strategies for stabilizing the metastable perovskite polymorphs based on crystal size reduction and surface functionalization are critically reviewed. Focus is on an unprecedented stabilization of metastable perovskite lattices in the 2D limit (e.g., with a thickness down to a few unit cells) due to the dominance of surface effects. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which bring new insights on the relationships between the crystal structures and optoelectronic properties and lead to emergent ferroelectricity in halide perovskites. A comprehensive understanding is provided on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties, with an emphasis on the second order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion caused by the oversized A&#8208;cations. Finally, future perspectives on new structure exploration and studies of fundamental photophysical properties using stabilized perovskite lattices are provided.

         <title>Generation and Control of Terahertz Spin Currents in Topology&#8208;Induced 2D Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2|Bi2Te3 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetism is successfully realized in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;induced van der Waals Fe3GeTe2, which is evidenced by ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the direction of the external magnetic field is rotated and the sample's front surface is reversed to probe the THz radiation symmetry. The results reveal that the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion effect is the dominant THz radiation mechanism.








Abstract
Future information technologies for low&#8208;dissipation quantum computation, high&#8208;speed storage, and on&#8208;chip communication applications require the development of atomically thin, ultracompact, and ultrafast spintronic devices in which information is encoded, stored, and processed using electron spin. Exploring low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials, designing novel heterostructures, and generating and controlling ultrafast electron spin in 2D magnetism at room temperature, preferably in the unprecedented terahertz (THz) regime, is in high demand. Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, optical THz spin&#8208;current bursts at room temperature in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) integrated with Bi2Te3 as a topological insulator are successfully realized. The symmetry of the THz radiation is effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. Thickness&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and structure&#8208;dependent nontrivial THz transients reveal that topology&#8208;enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin&#8208;current pulses. These results contribute to the goal of all&#8208;optical generation, manipulation, and detection of ultrafast THz spin currents in room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetism, accelerating the development of atomically thin high&#8208;speed spintronic devices.

         <title>Photopatternable Porous Separators for Micro&#8208;Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photopatterning of a unique porous separator is demonstrated by modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid, which serves as a templating agent. The photopatternable SU&#8208;8&#160;separator exhibits good electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical properties, and is integrated and electrochemically validated with nonplanar high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 3D Li&#8208;ion microbatteries.








Abstract
The miniaturization of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems, one of the key challenges facing the rapid expansion of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, has been limited by poor performance of the various energy&#8208;storage components at the micrometer scale. Here, the development of a unique photopatternable porous separator that overcomes the electrolyte difficulties involving resistive losses at small dimensions is reported. The separator is based on modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of a miscible ionic liquid. The ionic liquid serves as a templating agent, which is selectively removed by solution methods, leaving the SU&#8208;8&#160;scaffold whose interconnected porosity provides ion transport from the confined liquid electrolyte. The photopatternable separator exhibits good electrochemical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability during the operation of electrochemical devices in both 2D and 3D formats. For the latter, the separator demonstrates the ability to form conformal coatings over 3D structures. The development of the photopatternable separator overcomes the electrolyte issues, which have limited progress in the field of micro&#8208;EES.

         <title>Rapid Identification of DNA Fragments through Direct Sequencing with Electro&#8208;Optical Zero&#8208;Mode Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for flash sequencing of DNA molecules using single&#8208;molecule real&#8208;time sequencing is proposed. Electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides are presented, which use voltage to efficiently load ultralow inputs (picogram&#8208;to&#8208;nanogram levels) of various&#8208;sized DNA fragments, followed by their optically guided sequencing in just a few minutes.








Abstract
In contrast to sequence&#8208;specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the sample for surveying DNA. However, current sequencing technologies demand high inputs for a suitable library preparation, which typically necessitates DNA amplification, even for single&#8208;molecule sequencing methods. Here, electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides (eZMWs) are presented, which can load DNA into the confinement of zero&#8208;mode waveguides with high efficiency and negligible DNA fragment length bias.

&lt;p&gt;A method for flash sequencing of DNA molecules using single-molecule real-time sequencing is proposed. Electro-optical zero-mode waveguides are presented, which use voltage to efficiently load ultralow inputs (picogram-to-nanogram levels) of various-sized DNA fragments, followed by their optically guided sequencing in just a few minutes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to sequence-specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the sample for surveying DNA. However, current sequencing technologies demand high inputs for a suitable library preparation, which typically necessitates DNA amplification, even for single-molecule sequencing methods. Here, electro-optical zero-mode waveguides (eZMWs) are presented, which can load DNA into the confinement of zero-mode waveguides with high efficiency and negligible DNA fragment length bias. Using eZMWs, highly efficient voltage-induced loading of DNA fragments of various sizes from ultralow inputs (nanogram-to-picogram levels) is observed. Rapid DNA fragment identification is demonstrated by burst sequencing of short and long DNA molecules (260 and 20&#160;000&#160;bp) loaded from an equimolar picomolar-level concentration mixture in just a few minutes. The device allows further studies in which low-input DNA capture is essential, for example, in epigenetics, where native DNA is required for obtaining modified base information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Insensitive Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics by Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction strategy is developed to reduce the temperature sensitivity of inorganic perovskite solar cells to operation temperature, which may shed light on extending the application of perovskite solar cells for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near space, and exoplanet exploration.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) emerge as an ideal candidate for applications beyond terrestrial implementation due to their robustness. However, underlying mechanisms regarding their photovoltaic process at different temperatures remain unclear. Based on a stable absorber of CsPbI2.85(BrCl)0.15, considerable variation of corresponding device performance is revealed over temperature and further demonstrates a simple approach to an effective reduction of such variation. Interestingly, this absorber is found to be excitonic with poor carrier transport even at an ambient temperature of 285 K and below. With a novel device configuration of a PTB7&#8208;th/perovskite bulk heterojunction, exciton dissociation and carrier extraction is facilitated. The resultant solar cell attains a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.2% with the fill factor of &#8776;84%, which represents the highest&#8208;efficiency &#947;&#8208;phase IPSCs reported to date. Importantly, this device is less sensitive to operation temperature, wherein the PCE variation over the temperature range from 210 to 360 K is 60% suppressed compared with the reference. The approach is effectively extended to other IPSCs with different photoactive phases, which may shed light on realizing highly efficient IPSCs for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near&#8208;space, and exoplanet exploration.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Memristors Based on Ultrathin 2D Copper Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenides with intrinsic memristive properties is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated memristors exhibit relatively small switching voltage, fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range, as well as stable retention and switching characteristics, indicating their tangible applications in future electronics.








Abstract
Copper chalcogenides represent a class of materials with unique crystal structures, high electrical conductivity, and earth abundance, and are recognized as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electronics. However, their 2D structures and the corresponding electronic properties have rarely been touched. Herein, a series of ultrathin copper chalcogenide nanosheets with thicknesses down to two unit cells are successfully synthesized, including layered Cu2Te, as well as nonlayered CuSe and Cu9S5, via van der Waals epitaxy, and their nonvolatile memristive behavior is investigated for the first time. Benefiting from the highly active Cu ions with low migration barriers, the memristors based on ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenide crystals exhibit relatively small switching voltage (&#8776;0.4&#160;V), fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range (from 80 to 420 K), as well as stable retention and good cyclic endurance. These results demonstrate their tangible applications in future low&#8208;power, cryogenic, and high temperature harsh electronics.

         <title>Intracellular Self&#8208;Immolative Polyprodrug with Near&#8208;Infrared Light Guided Accumulation and in Vivo Visualization of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is developed, wherein the drug accumulation in tumor is significantly enhanced under laser&#8208;triggered mild hyperthermia, and the drug release behavior is real&#8208;time monitored by ratiometric photoacoustic signals. PMTO holds great potential for enhanced targeted chemotherapy efficacy as well as the visualization of drug release in vivo, guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.








Abstract
The selective accumulation and real&#8208;time monitoring of drug release at tumor site are the key bottlenecks to the clinical translation of polyprodrug. Herein, an intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is exploited, which not only shows the enhanced cellular internalization and selective accumulation in tumor site under the mild hyperthermia triggered by laser irradiation, but also possesses the self&#8208;monitoring drug release ability in vivo. The polyprodrug amphiphiles are synthesized by sequential esterification reaction, and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) serves as blocking agent. On account of the mild hyperthermia produced by PMTO under the laser irradiation at tumor site, the cell membranous permeability increases, resulting in the enhanced cellular internalization and drug accumulation in tumor. After internalized by cells, the self&#8208;immolative PMTO nanoparticles can release free mitoxantrone (MTO) in intracellular reductive environment, and ratiometric photoacoustic imaging based on distinct signals between MTO and PMTO is presented to trace the drug release in vivo. Finally, this self&#8208;monitoring polyprodrug presents significant tumor suppression efficacy, which exhibits great potential for guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.

         <title>Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2&#8208;Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substitution strategy of partial occupation of the Na&#8208;site by Mg ions in Na0.773Li0.25Mn0.75O2 not only reduces the chemical potential energy of oxygen but also reduces the undercoordinated oxygen, the nonbonded, and electron&#8208;deficient O2p states, thus enhancing the stability of oxygen anodic redox upon long&#8208;term cycling.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2&#8208;type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron&#8208;deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6&#8211;4.5&#160;V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a &#8776;1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen&#8208;related Mn&#8208;rich cathodes.

         <title>Replicating the Cynandra opis Butterfly's Structural Color for Bioinspired Bigrating Color Filters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the unique structures found in the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, two&#8208;photon photolithography is used to fabricate bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. It is demonstrated that by tuning the grating period a structural color palette array can be printed and used as an artificial structural color device optimized for technological applications.








Abstract
Multilayer grating structures, such as those found on the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, are able to interact with light to generate structural coloration. When illuminated and viewed at defined angles, such structural color is characterized by exceptional purity and brightness. To provide further insight into the mechanism of structural coloration, two&#8208;photon laser lithography is used to fabricate bioinspired bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. Through the use of both spectral measurements and finite&#8208;element method simulations, herein specific feature dimensions are identified that due to the combined effects of multilayer interference and diffraction generate excellent spectral characteristics and high color purity over the entire visible range. Additionally, it is demonstrated that variation of feature period and/or height plays a central role in controlling both hue and purity. Importantly, such tuneable bigrating structures are of significant utility in color filtering applications.

         <title>Diradical&#8208;Featured Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Photothermal Material with High&#8208;Spin State in Dimers for Ultra&#8208;Broadband Solar Energy Harvesting</title>

         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the synergetic effect of diradical feature and strong intermolecular interactions, a stable croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, with high&#8208;spin state and ultra&#8208;broadband absorption covering 300 to 2000&#160;nm in the aggregated state is obtained. CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T demonstrates highly efficient photothermal conversion promoted by multiple nonradiative decay pathways, being a potential candidate for solar thermoelectric generation.








Abstract
Organic materials with radical characteristics are gaining increasing attention, due to their potential implications in highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Manipulating intermolecular interactions is crucial for tuning radical properties, as well as regulating their absorption bands, and thus improving the photothermal conversion efficiency. Herein, a diradical&#8208;featured organic small&#8208;molecule croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, is reported for highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Upon aggregation, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T exists in dimer form, stabilized by the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and exhibits a rarely reported high&#8208;spin state. Benefiting from the synergic effects of radical characteristics and strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder absorbs broadly from 300 to 2000&#160;nm. In&#8208;depth investigations with transient absorption analysis reveal that the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can promote nonradiative relaxation by accelerating internal conversion and facilitating intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between dimeric molecules to open up faster internal conversion pathways. Remarkably, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder demonstrates a high photothermal efficiency of 79.5% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. By employing CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T as a solar harvester, a CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T&#8208;loaded flexible self&#8208;healing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (H&#8208;PDMS) film, named as H&#8208;PDMS/CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T self&#8208;healing film, is fabricated and employed for solar&#8211;thermal applications. These findings provide a feasible guideline for developing highly efficient diradical&#8208;featured organic photothermal materials.

         <title>Endogenous Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Coupled Electrospun Short Fiber via Collecting Wound Exudation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with excellent reversible hydroscopicity and biostable conductivity is fabricated to achieve precise tissue remodeling by collecting a large amount of secretions in the early stages of wound healing and transmitting bioelectrical signals to proactively match the cascade reaction of tissue repair.








Abstract
Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF, is constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibits rapid reversible water absorption, reaching maximum after only 30 s. The stable and uniform distribution of polydopamine&#8208;reduced graphene oxide endows the scaffold with stable electrical and mechanical performances even after long&#8208;term immersion. Due to its unique &#8208; bionic structure and tissue affinity, the scaffold further acts as an &#8220;electronic skin,&#8221; which transmits endogenous bioelectricity via absorbing wound exudates, promoting the treatment of diabetic wounds. Furthermore, under the endogenous EF, the cascade release of vascular endothelial growth factor accelerates the healing process. Thus, the versatile scaffold is expected to be an ideal candidate for repairing different defect tissues, especially electrosensitive tissues.

         <title>Achieving Ultimate Narrowband and Ultrapure Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin Multi&#8208;Resonance Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Emitters</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency ultrapure blue delayed&#8208;fluorescence materials are produced by the strategic doping of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms into the fused polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin &#960;&#8208;system. These new fluorophores allow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to demonstrate ideal narrowband and ultrapure blue electroluminescence, meeting the requirements for modern ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
To achieve an ultimate wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, there is great demand for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) enabling monochromatic, ultrapure blue electroluminescence (EL). Herein, high&#8208;efficiency and ultrapure blue OLEDs based on polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials, BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z, are reported. The key to the design of the present luminophores is the exquisite combination and interplay of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms embedded in a fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system. Comprehensive photophysical and computational investigations of this family of MR&#8208;TADF materials reveal that the systematic implementation of chalcogen (oxygen and sulfur) atoms can finely modulate the emission color while maintaining a narrow bandwidth, as well as the spin&#8208;flipping rates between the excited singlet and triplet states. Consequently, OLEDs based on BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z demonstrate narrowband and ultrapure blue EL emission, with peaks at 445&#8211;463&#160;nm and full width at half maxima of 18&#8211;23&#160;nm, leading to Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage&#8208;y coordinates in the range of 0.04&#8211;0.08. Particularly, for OLEDs incorporating sulfur&#8208;doped BOBS&#8208;Z and BSBS&#8208;Z, notably high maximum external EL quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 26.8%, respectively, and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved concurrently.

         <title>Supramolecular Reinforcement of Polymer&#8211;Nanoparticle Hydrogels for Modular Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based supramolecular binding enhances the viscoelastic properties of polymer&#8211;nanoparticle hydrogels and provides modular exchange of building blocks. This paradigm expands the interactions available for the formation of this class of injectable nanocomposite hydrogels, enabling unique applications in 3D printing, magnetic materials, and conductive hydrogels.








Abstract
Moldable hydrogels are increasingly used as injectable or extrudable materials in biomedical and industrial applications owing to their ability to flow under applied stress (shear&#8208;thin) and reform a stable network (self&#8208;heal). Nanoscale components can be added to dynamic polymer networks to modify their mechanical properties and broaden the scope of applications. Viscoelastic polymer&#8211;nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels comprise a versatile and tunable class of dynamic nanocomposite materials that form via reversible interactions between polymer chains and nanoparticles. However, PNP hydrogel formation is restricted to specific interactions between select polymers and nanoparticles, resulting in a limited range of mechanical properties and constraining their utility. Here, a facile strategy to reinforce PNP hydrogels through the simple addition of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) to the formulation is introduced. The formation of polypseudorotoxanes between &#945;CD and the hydrogel components resulted in a drastic enhancement of the mechanical properties. Furthermore, supramolecular reinforcement of CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels enabled decoupling of the mechanical properties and material functionality. This allows for modular exchange of structural components from a library of functional polymers and nanoparticles. &#945;CD supramolecular binding motifs are leveraged to form CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels with biopolymers for high&#8208;fidelity 3D (bio)printing and drug delivery as well as with inorganic NPs to engineer magnetic or conductive&#160;materials.

         <title>Designing Angstrom&#8208;Scale Asymmetric MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Cavities for High Monovalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ion&#8208;selective membrane that possesses an asymmetrical bi&#8208;layer of functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF) with heterostructured connections between the two MOFs is introduced. The membrane consists of natural asymmetrical nanochannels that exhibit both extraordinary high ionic current rectification and high monovalent ion selectivity.








Abstract
Biological ion channels feature angstrom&#8208;scale asymmetrical cavity structures, which are the key to achieving highly efficient separation and sensing of alkali metal ions from aqueous resources. The clean energy future and lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems heavily rely on highly efficient ionic separations. However, artificial recreation of such a sophisticated biostructure has been technically challenging. Here, a highly tunable design concept is introduced to fabricate monovalent ion&#8208;selective membranes with asymmetric sub&#8208;nanometer pores in which energy barriers are implanted. The energy barriers act against ionic movements, which hold the target ion while facilitating the transport of competing ions. The membrane consists of bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF), possessing a 6 to 3.4&#8208;angstrom passable cavity structure. The ionic current measurements exhibit an unprecedented ionic current rectification ratio of above 100 with exceptionally high selectivity ratios of 84 and 80 for K+/Li+ and Na+/ Li+, respectively (1.14 Li+ mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). Furthermore, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, it is shown that the combined effect of spatial hindrance and nucleophilic entrapment to induce energy surge baffles is responsible for the membrane's ultrahigh selectivity and ion rectification. This work demonstrates a striking advance in developing monovalent ion&#8208;selective channels and has implications in sensing, energy storage, and separation technologies.

         <title>Miniaturized Multispectral Detector Derived from Gradient Response Units on Single MAPbX3 Microwire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optic&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector with response&#8208;modulated photodetector units on gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire is fabricated to detect and discriminate incident light from 450 to 790&#160;nm, with 25&#160;nm resolution. This work will push multispectral detectors to universal application and provide guidance for forthcoming research in novel functional perovskite devices.








Abstract
Miniaturized multispectral detectors are urgently desired given the unprecedented prosperity of smart optoelectronic chips for integrated functions including communication, imaging, scientific analysis, etc. However, multispectral detectors require complicated prism optics or interference/interferometric filters for spectral recognition, which hampers the miniaturization and their subsequent integration in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, inspired by the advance of computational imaging, optical&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector on 4&#160;mm gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire with a diameter of 30&#160;&#181;m, is reported. With accurate composition engineering, halide ions in MAPbX3 microwire vary from Cl to I giving in the gradual variation of optical bandgap from 2.96 to 1.68&#160;eV along axis. The sensing units on MAPbX3 microwire offer the response edge ranging from 450 to 790&#160;nm with the responsivity over 20&#160;mA W&#8722;1, &#8722;3dB&#160;width over 450&#160;Hz, LDR of &#8776;60&#160;dB, and a noise current less than &#8776;1.4 &#215; 10&#8722;12 A Hz&#8722;0.5. As a result, the derived miniaturized detector achieves the function of multispectral sensing and discrimination with spectral resolution of &#8776;25&#160;nm and mismatch of &#8776;10&#160;nm. Finally, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept colorful imaging is successfully conducted with the miniaturized multispectral detector to further confirm its application in spectral recognition.

         <title>Single&#8208;, Dual&#8208;, Triple, and Quadruple&#8208;Wavelength Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasing in Blue&#8208;Phase Liquid Crystal</title>

A strategy of how to controllably construct a multiwavelength laser, from single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208; to quadruple&#8208;wavelength, in a simple configuration, i.e., a free&#8208;standing blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals film, is presented. The corresponding principle is also investigated.








Abstract
Soft organic lasers with multiwavelength output and high spectral purity are of crucial importance for versatile photonic devices, owing to their monochromaticity, coherence, and high intensity.&#160;However, there remain challenges for the achievement of&#160;surface&#8208;emitting multiwavelength lasing in soft photonic crystals, and the relative mechanisms need to be investigated. Herein, single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quadruple&#8208;wavelength lasers are successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped blue&#8208;phase liquid crystal (BPLC) film. The number and wavelength of the lasing peaks can be manipulated by tuning the center of the bandgap, the order parameter of the laser dye, the quality of the resonance cavity, and even the pump energy. For single&#8208;wavelength lasing, &#160;a lasing peak with&#160;an ultranarrow linewidth of 0.04&#160;nm (Q&#8208;factor of 13&#160;454) is achieved. Multiwavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: i) the narrow bandgaps of the BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low&#8208;order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and iv) the highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single&#8208;to&#8208;quadruple&#8208;wavelength surface&#8208;emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next&#8208;generation optical devices.

         <title>Multifunctional Biomimetic Nanovaccines Based on Photothermal and Weak&#8208;Immunostimulatory Nanoparticulate Cores for the Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal porous silicon@Au nanocomposites are used as particular cores to be coated by cancer cell membranes to construct biomimetic nanovaccine with good biosafety. The developed nanovaccine shows a good prophylactic and synergistic photothermal&#8211;immunotherapeutic efficacy on the occurrence, growth, and metastasis of solid tumors, via the recruitment and activation of immune&#8208;related cells to elicit antitumor immunity.








Abstract
An alternative strategy of choosing photothermal and weak&#8208;immunostimulatory porous silicon@Au nanocomposites as particulate cores to prepare a biomimetic nanovaccine is reported to improve its biosafety and immunotherapeutic efficacy for solid tumors. A quantitative analysis method is used to calculate the loading amount of cancer cell membranes onto porous silicon@Au nanocomposites. Assisted with foreign&#8208;body responses, these exogenous nanoparticulate cores with weak immunostimulatory effect can still efficiently deliver cancer cell membranes into dendritic cells to activate them and the downstream antitumor immunity, resulting in no occurrence of solid tumors and the survival of all immunized mice during 55 day observation. In addition, this nanovaccine, as a photothermal therapeutic agent, synergized with additional immunotherapies can significantly inhibit the growth and metastasis of established solid tumors, via the initiation of the antitumor immune responses in the body and the reversion of their immunosuppressive microenvironments. Considering the versatile surface engineering of porous silicon nanoparticles, the strategy developed here is beneficial to construct multifunctional nanovaccines with better biosafety and more diagnosis or therapeutic modalities against the occurrence, recurrence, or metastasis of solid tumors in future clinical practice.

         <title>A Universal Cosolvent Evaporation Strategy Enables Direct Printing of Perovskite Single Crystals for Optoelectronic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite single crystals (SCs) are grown on&#8208;demand at room temperature and integrated directly onto optoelectronic devices via printing and coating using a scalable cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy. The CSE strategy controls supersaturation and suppresses competing nucleation during drying to yield high&#8208;quality SCs of 2D, 3D, lead&#8208;free, and mixed&#8208;ion perovskites with minimal residue.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskite (MHP) single crystals (SCs) are in high demand for a growing number of printed electronic applications due to their superior optoelectronic properties compared to polycrystalline thin films. There is an urgent need to make SC fabrication facile, scalable, and compatible with the printed electronic manufacturing infrastructure. Here, a universal cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy is presented by which perovskite SCs and arrays are produced directly on substrates via printing and coating methods within minutes at room temperature from drying droplets. The CSE strategy successfully guides the supersaturation via controlled drying of droplets to suppress all crystallization pathways but one, and is shown to produce SCs of a wide variety of 3D, 2D, and mixed&#8208;cation/halide perovskites with consistency. This approach works with commonly used precursors and solvents, making it universal. Importantly, the SC consumes the precursor in the droplet, which enables the large&#8208;scale fabrication of SC arrays with minimal residue. Direct on&#8208;chip fabrication of 3D and 2D perovskite photodetector devices with outstanding performance is demonstrated. The approach shows that any MHP SC can now be manufactured on substrates using precision printing and scalable, high&#8208;throughput coating methods.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Twist Fibers toward Rotating Microengines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Untethered twist fibers with reversible responsiveness have shown great potential as rotating microengine, of which high torque and high rotational deformation are desirable. Herein, liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) with fixed twisting orientation is developed, demonstrating outstanding rotational performance due to its significant intrinsic deformation. The obtained LCETF can function as a rotating microengine in an electricity generator.








Abstract
Untethered twist fibers do not require end&#8208;anchoring structures to hold their twist orientation and offer simple designs and convenient operation. The reversible responsiveness of these fibers allows them to generate torque and rotational deformation continuously upon the application of external stimuli. The fibers therefore have potential in rotating microengines. In practical applications, high torque and rotational deformation are desirable to meet work capacity requirements. However, the simultaneous endowment of reversible responsiveness and high rotational performance to untethered twist fibers remains a challenge. In this study, a liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) is designed and developed with a fixed twisting alignment of mesogens to provide untethered and reversible responsiveness. Outstanding rotational performance can be achieved when the mesogenic orientation is disrupted through heat triggering. Owing to the significant intrinsic contractile ratio of the LCE material, the rotational deformation of the LCETF can reach 243.6&#176; mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific torque can reach 10.1 N m kg&#8722;1, which exceeds previously reported values. In addition, the LCETF can be exploited in a rotating microengine to convert heat into electricity with an induction voltage as high as 9.4&#160;V. This work broadens the applications of LCEs for energy harvesters, micromachines, and soft robots.

         <title>Highly Bright AIE Nanoparticles by Regulating the Substituent of Rhodanine for Precise Early Detection of Atherosclerosis and Drug Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly bright and atherosclerosis (AS)&#8208;targeting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe is designed and synthesized by delicate molecular surgery strategy of AIE luminogen and surface functionalization with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody, which can serve as an effective near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque, studying the progression of AS, and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive, and rapid manner.








Abstract
Fluorescent probes capable of precise detection of atherosclerosis (AS) at an early stage and fast assessment of anti&#8208;AS drugs in animal level are particularly valuable. Herein, a highly bright aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe is introduced by regulating the substituent of rhodanine for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive, and rapid manner. With dicyanomethylene&#8208;substituted rhodanine as the electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, the AIE luminogen named TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN shows the highest molar extinction coefficient, the largest photoluminescence quantum yield, and the most redshifted absorption/emission spectra simultaneously as compared to the control compounds. The nanoprobes are obtained with an amphiphilic copolymer as the matrix encapsulating TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN molecules, which are further surface functionalized with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody for specifically binding to CD47 overexpressed in AS plaques. Such nanoprobes allow efficient recognition of AS plaques at different stages in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (apoE&#8722;/&#8722;) mice, especially for the recognition of early&#8208;stage AS plaques prior to micro&#8208;computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These features impel to apply the nanoprobes in monitoring the therapeutic effects of anti&#8208;AS drugs, providing a powerful tool for anti&#8208;AS drug screening. Their potential use in targeted imaging of human carotid plaque is further demonstrated.

         <title>A Flexible and Degradable Hybrid Mineral as a Plastic Substitute</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomineralization, a flexible and degradable hybrid mineral (HM), which is dominated by minerals, is constructed by the inorganic ionic polymerization of calcium phosphate ionic oligomers under biomimetic control from organic templates (polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate). The HM shows potential to serve as a plastic substitute owing to its superior mechanical properties and environmental friendliness.








Abstract
The development of environmentally friendly plastics is critical to ensure sustainable development. In contrast to polymer plastics derived from petrochemicals, inorganic minerals, which are the most abundant matter in Earth's crust, are environmentally friendly. However, the brittleness of these minerals limits their applications as plastics. Here, because of the advantages of both biomineralization and inorganic ionic polymerization, the calcium phosphate (CaP, a typical geological and biological mineral) oligomers are used for biomimetic mineralization under the regulation of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate, resulting in flexible CaP nanofibers with periodic structural defects. The assembly of CaP nanofibers produces a hierarchically structured bulk hybrid mineral (HM), which overcomes the intrinsic brittleness of minerals and exhibits plasticity characteristics. HM exhibits better hardness and thermostability than classical polymer plastics due to its dominant mineral composition. Notably, HM is environmentally friendly and degradable in nature, as it can potentially participate in geological cycles, indicating that this material is an optimal plastic substitute. The construction of periodic structural defects within flexible minerals expands the current understanding of materials science.

HM exhibits better hardness and thermostability than classical polymer plastics due to its dominant mineral composition. Notably, HM is environmentally friendly and degradable in nature, as it can potentially participate in geological cycles, indicating that this material is an optimal plastic substitute. The construction of periodic structural defects within flexible minerals expands the current understanding of materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Technique for Controlling Anisotropic Ion Diffusion: Bulk Single&#8208;Crystalline Metallic Silicon Clathrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic ion&#8208;diffusion process is developed. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.








Abstract
Na&#8208;free Si clathrates consisting only of Si cages are an allotrope of diamond&#8208;structured Si. This material is promising for various device applications, such as next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. The probable technique for synthesizing Na&#8208;free Si clathrates is to extract Na+ from the Si cages of Na24Si136. Vacuum annealing is presently a well&#8208;known conventional and effective approach for extracting Na. However, this study demonstrates that Na+ cannot be extracted from the surface of a single&#8208;crystalline type&#8208;II metallic Si clathrate (Na24Si136) in areas deeper than 150&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, a novel method is developed to control anisotropic ion diffusion: this is effective for various compounds with a large difference in the bonding strength between their constituent elements, such as Na24Si136 composed of covalent Si cages and weakly trapped Na+. By skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force, Na+ is homogeneously extracted regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity. Additionally, the proposed point defect model is evaluated via density functional theory, and the migration of Na+ between the Si cages is explained. It is expected that the developed experimental and computational techniques would significantly advance material design for synthesizing thermodynamically metastable materials.

         <title>Interface Engineering Between Multi&#8208;Elemental Alloy Nanoparticles and a Carbon Support Toward Stable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach is used to improve the stability (e.g., nanoparticle agglomeration) of multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles on a carbon substrate. MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon catalysts with a hierarchical structure are synthesized via a high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method. The catalysts show excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, holding great potential for a range of catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles have recently received notable attention owing to their high activity and superior phase stability. Previous syntheses of MEA nanoparticles mainly used carbon as the support, owing to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and tunable defective sites. However, the interfacial stability issue, such as nanoparticle agglomeration, remains outstanding due to poor interfacial binding between MEA and carbon. Such a problem often causes performance decay when MEA nanoparticles are used as catalysts, hindering their practical applications. Herein, an interface engineering strategy is developed to synthesize MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon hierarchical catalysts, where the oxide on carbon helps disperse and stabilize the MEA nanoparticles toward superior thermal and electrochemical stability. Using several MEA compositions (PdRuRh, PtPdIrRuRh, and PdRuRhFeCoNi) and oxides (TiO2 and Cr2O3) as model systems, it is shown that adding the oxide renders superior interfacial stability and therefore excellent catalytic performance. Excellent thermal stability is demonstrated under transmission electron microscopy with in situ heating up to 1023 K, as well as via long&#8208;term cycling (&gt;370 hours) of a Li&#8211;O2 battery as a harsh electrochemical condition to challenge the catalyst stability. This work offers a new route toward constructing efficient and stable catalysts for various applications.

         <title>Nanovesicle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Delivery of Immune Checkpoint Blockades to Potentiate Therapeutic Efficacy and Prevent Side Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4)&#8208;conjugated and tumor antigen (TA)&#8208;loaded nanovesicles derived from dendritic cells can facilitate spatiotemporal delivery of TA and &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 to tumor&#8208;specific T cells. This leads to selective activation of tumor&#8208;reactive T cells, effective inhibition of tumor growth and prevention of immune&#8208;related adverse events, improving the current immune checkpoint blockade therapies.








Abstract
Despite the clinically proven efficacies of immune checkpoint blockades, including anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4&#160;antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4), the low response rate and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) in cancer patients represent major drawbacks of the therapy. These drawbacks of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy are mainly due to the suboptimal activation of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the systemic nonspecific activation of T cells. To overcome such drawbacks, &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;is delivered by dendritic cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles presenting tumor antigens (DCNV&#8208;TAs) that exclusively interact with tumor&#8208;specific T cells, leading to selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific CTLs. Compared to conventional &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy, treatment with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;conjugated DCNV&#8208;TAs significantly inhibits tumor growth and reduces irAEs in syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study demonstrates that the spatiotemporal presentation of both &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;and tumor antigens enables selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific T cells and potentiates the antitumor efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;without inducing systemic irAEs.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomachinery for Enhancement of Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8211;amorphous calcium phosphate nanomachine that induces extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils and regenerates new bone in a dynamic and programmable manner is developed. This multifunctional nanomachinery is comparable to the function of osteoblasts. The RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines that simulate physiological processes brings new opportunities and challenges to bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
The visionary idea that RNA adopts nonbiological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal. These RNA molecules have ample chemical functionality and self&#8208;assemble to form distinct nanostructures in response to external stimuli. They may be combined with inorganic materials to produce nanomachines that carry cargo to a target site in a controlled manner and respond dynamically to environmental changes. Comparable to biological cells, programmed RNA nanomachines have the potential to replicate bone healing in vitro. Here, an RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachine is developed, which accomplishes intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen scaffolds to mimic bone formation in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that noncovalent hydrogen bonding provides the energy source that initiates self&#8208;assembly of these nanomachines. Incorporation of the RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines into collagen scaffolds in vivo creates an osteoinductive microenvironment within a bone defect that is conducive to rapid biomineralization and osteogenesis. Addition of RNA&#8208;degrading enzymes into RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines further creates a stop signal that inhibits unwarranted bone formation in tissues. The potential of RNA in building functional nanostructures has been underestimated in the past. The concept of RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines participating in physiological processes may transform the nanoscopic world of life science.

         <title>Inverse Design of Ferroelectric&#8208;Order in Perovskite Crystal for Self&#8208;Powered Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>

A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3&#160;photodetector is fabricated based on &#8220;inverse&#8208;design&#8221; of the ferroelectric order.








Abstract
It has always been a hot topic to design an orderly mesoscopic structure in functional materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions. The existence of domains in ferroelectric materials has been proven to affect the macroscopic properties, being actively studied in nonlinear optical conversion and piezoelectric effects. However, the high&#8208;efficiency photoelectric conversion capability of ferroelectric crystals has not yet been explored. Here, the authors study the orderly arrangement of ferroelectric order in KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3 (KTN) perovskite crystals, and design the &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; domains by tuning the Curie temperature Tc, thereby generating abundant charged domain walls and robust conductive channels for electrons and holes. An ultrahigh ultraviolet photoresponsivity is achieved in the KTN crystal under zero bias voltage, being about four orders magnitude higher than that of the well&#8208;known ferroelectric materials. The substantial improvement can be attributed to the judiciously designed ferroelectric order, as demonstrated by the conductive atomic force microscopy. In addition, KTN detector exhibits high stability and reliability after high&#8208;temperature and fatigue treatment. KTN crystal features giant photoresponsivity, high electric&#8211;optical coefficient, and large &#967;(2) nonlinearity concurrently, indicating its great potential for application of all&#8208;optical devices on photonic chips.

         <title>Record&#8208;High Superconductivity in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Emerged in Compressed 2H&#8208;TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state emerges in 2H&#8208;TaS2 under high pressure. The Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of &#8776;16.4 K at &#8776;157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). It is the first time this remarkable superconducting state has been found in TMDs. The result brings a new broad perspective on layered materials.








Abstract
Pressure has always been an effective method for uncovering novel phenomena and properties in condensed matter physics. Here, an electrical transport study is carried on 2H&#8208;TaS2 up to &#8776;208&#160;GPa, and an unexpected superconducting state (SC&#8208;II) emerging around 86.1&#160;GPa with an initial critical temperature (Tc) of 9.6 K is found. As pressure increases, the Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of 16.4 K at 157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The original superconducting state (SC&#8208;I) is found to be re&#8208;enhanced above 100&#160;GPa after the recession around 10&#160;GPa, and coexists with SC&#8208;II to the highest pressure applied in this work. In situ high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements reveal that the occurrence of SC&#8208;II is accompanied by a structural modification and a concurrent enhancement of hole carrier density. The new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state in 2H&#8208;TaS2 can be attributed to the change of the electronic states near the Fermi surface, owing to pressure&#8208;induced interlayer modulation. It is the first time finding this remarkable superconducting state in TMDs, which not only brings a new broad of perspective on layered materials but also expands the field of pressure&#8208;modified superconductivity.

         <title>A Programmable Dual&#8208;Regime Spray for Large&#8208;Scale and Custom&#8208;Designed Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables direct writing of custom electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles) into stretch fabrics or garments over meter scale is introduced. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes of large animals to support reliable monitoring of health data under ambulatory conditions in a wirelessly controlled fashion.








Abstract
Increasing demand for wearable healthcare synergistically advances the field of electronic textiles, or e&#8208;textiles, allowing for ambulatory monitoring of vital health signals. Despite great promise, the pragmatic deployment of e&#8208;textiles in clinical practice remains challenged due to the lack of a method in producing custom&#8208;designed e&#8208;textiles at high spatial resolution across a large area. To this end, a programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables the direct custom writing of functional nanoparticles into arbitrary fabrics at sub&#8208;millimeter resolution over meter scale is employed. The resulting e&#8208;textiles retain the intrinsic fabric properties in terms of mechanical flexibility, water&#8208;vapor permeability, and comfort against multiple uses and laundry cycles. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes to support the high&#8208;fidelity recording of physiological and electrophysiological signals on the skin under ambulatory conditions. Pilot field tests in a remote health&#8208;monitoring setting with a large animal, such as a horse, demonstrate the scalability and utility of the e&#8208;textiles beyond conventional devices. This approach will be suitable for the rapid prototyping of custom e&#8208;textiles tailored to meet various clinical needs.

         <title>Orchestrated Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanohybrids Regulate Macrophage Polarization and Dendritic Cell Maturation for Oncotherapy with Augmented Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;designed yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA with intrinsic immunomodulatory effects are constructed to realize oncotherapy with augmented antitumor immunity through regulating macrophage polarization and dendritic cell maturation.








Abstract
The protumoral and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments greatly limit the antitumor immune responses of nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Here, the intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of orchestrated nanoparticles and their ability to simultaneously trigger tumor antigen release, thereby reversing immunosuppression and achieving potent antitumor immunity and augmented cancer therapy, are explored. By optimizing both the composition and morphology, a facile strategy is proposed to construct yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids (Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA, FCMP). The intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of FCMP are utilized to reprogram macrophages to M1 phenotype and induce the maturation of dendritic cells. In addition, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of FCMP contribute to amplified immunogenic cell death induced by multiaugmented chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and synergistic tumor treatment. Taking advantage of the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure, accurate T1&#8208;T2 dual&#8208;mode magnetic resonance imaging can be realized and CDT can be maximized through sufficient exposure of both the Fe3O4 core and MnO2 shell. Potent antitumor effects are found to substantially inhibit the growth of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids with tailored properties. This work establishes a novel strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoplatforms with yolk&#8208;shell structure for effective cancer therapy with immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced antitumor immunity.

         <title>Surfaces Decorated with Enantiomorphically Pure Polymer Nanohelices via Hierarchical Chirality Transfer across Multiple Length Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;templated approach to prepare nanohelices of chiral parylene polymers on surfaces with tunable length, pitch, and higher&#8208;order mesoscale morphologies by altering the chirality of the template and/or the precursor is described. A phenomenon of chirality transfer from molecular to mesoscale level takes places during chemical vapor deposition, allowing for detection of weak chiral signals on such surfaces.








Abstract
Mesoscale chiral materials are prepared by lithographic methods, assembly of chiral building blocks, and through syntheses in the presence of polarized light. Typically, these processes result in micrometer&#8208;sized structures, require complex top&#8211;down manipulation, or rely on tedious asymmetric separation. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of chiral precursors into supported films of liquid crystals (LCs) are discovered to result in superhierarchical arrangements of enantiomorphically pure nanofibers. Depending on the molecular chirality of the 1&#8208;hydroxyethyl [2.2]paracyclophane precursor, extended arrays of enantiomorphic nanohelices are formed from achiral nematic templates. Arrays of chiral nanohelices extend over hundreds of micrometers and consistently display enantiomorphic micropatterns. The pitch of individual nanohelices depends on the enantiomeric excess and the purity of the chiral precursor, consistent with the theoretical model of a doubly twisted LC director configuration. During CVD of chiral precursors into cholesteric LC films, aspects of molecular and mesoscale asymmetry combine constructively to form regularly twisted nanohelices. Enantiomorphic surfaces permit the tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, such as the asymmetric induction of weak chiral systems.

         <title>Artificial Nacre with High Toughness Amplification Factor: Residual Stress&#8208;Engineering Sparks Enhanced Extrinsic Toughening Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrates an anti&#8208;intuitive strategy that, with the merit of biomimetic designs, residual stress that is conventionally harmful to ceramics can inversely help improve the fracture toughness of biomimetic ceramics through nanoscale residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening. This provides new insights into the design principles of nacre&#8208;like materials at the bottom level.








Abstract
The high fracture toughness of mollusk nacre is predominantly attributed to the structure&#8208;associated extrinsic mechanisms such as platelet sliding and crack deflection. While the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures are widely adopted in artificial ceramics, the extrinsic mechanisms are often weakened by the relatively low tensile strength of the platelets with a large aspect ratio, which makes the fracture toughness of these materials much lower than expected. Here, it is demonstrated that the fracture toughness of artificial nacre materials with high inorganic contents can be improved by residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening, which can catalyze more effective extrinsic toughening mechanisms that are specific to the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures. Thereby, while the absolute fracture toughness of the materials is not comparable with advanced ceramic&#8208;based composites, the toughness amplification factor of the material reaches 16.1&#160;&#177; 1.1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomimetic ceramics. The results reveal that, with the merit of nacre&#8208;mimetic structural designs, the overall fracture toughness of the artificial nacre can be improved by the platelet strengthening through extrinsic toughening mechanisms, although the intrinsic fracture toughness may decrease at platelet level due to the strengthening. It is anticipated that advanced structural ceramics with exceeding performance can be fabricated through these unconventional strategies.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free, Low&#8208;Temperature Crystallization of Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerosol&#8208;assisted crystallization method to prepare high&#8208;quality, pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films at only 100&#160;&#176;C without chemical additives is reported. Remarkably improved phase stability of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films and their applications in solar cells are demonstrated. The overriding mechanism of stabilizing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is shown to be relaxation of residual tensile strains in the films.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) is attractive for photovoltaic devices due to its optimal bandgap at around 1.45&#160;eV and improved thermal stability compared with methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Crystallization of phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 conventionally requires high&#8208;temperature thermal annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C whilst the obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is metastable at room temperature. Here, aerosol&#8208;assisted crystallization (AAC) is reported, which converts yellow &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at only 100&#160;&#176;C using precursor solutions containing only lead iodide and formamidinium iodide with no chemical additives. The obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 exhibits remarkably enhanced stability compared to the 150&#160;&#176;C annealed counterparts, in combination with improvements in film crystallinity and photoluminescence yield. Using X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray scattering, and density functional theory simulation, it is identified that relaxation of residual tensile strains, achieved through the lower annealing temperature and post&#8208;crystallization crystal growth during AAC, is the key factor that facilitates the formation of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This overcomes the strain&#8208;induced lattice expansion that is known to cause the metastability of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Accordingly, pure FAPbI3 p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells are reported, facilitated by the low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;100&#160;&#176;C) AAC processing, which demonstrates increases of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared to devices fabricated using 150&#160;&#176;C annealed films.

         <title>Boosting Reversibility and Stability of Li Storage in SnO2&#8211;Mo Multilayers: Introduction of Interfacial Oxygen Redistribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In assembled SnO2&#8211;Mo multilayers with adjustable interfaces and tunable oxygen distribution, the regulating effect of the SnO2/Mo interfaces on the stability and reversibility of conversion between SnO2 and Sn/Li2O is quantified. Mo/SnO2/Mo with boosted charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, realizes a breakthrough performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6% and large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1 retaining &#8776;100% after 700 cycles.








Abstract
Among the promising high&#8208;capacity anode materials, SnO2 represents a classic and important candidate that involves both conversion and alloying reactions toward Li storage. However, the inferior reversibility of conversion reactions usually results in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE, &#8776;60%), small reversible capacity, and poor cycling stability. Here, it is demonstrated that by carefully designing the interface structure of SnO2&#8211;Mo, a breakthrough comprehensive performance with ultrahigh average ICE of 92.6%, large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1, and 100% capacity retention after 700 cycles can be realized in a multilayer Mo/SnO2/Mo electrode. Furthermore, high capacity retentions are also achieved in pouch&#8208;type Mo/SnO2/Mo||Li half cells and Mo/SnO2/Mo||LiFePO4 full cells. The amorphous SnO2/Mo interfaces, which are induced by redistribution of oxygen between SnO2 and Mo, can precisely adjust the reversible capacity and cycling stability of the multilayers, while the stable capacities are parabolic with the interfacial density. Theoretical calculations and in/ex situ investigation reveal that oxygen redistribution in SnO2/Mo heterointerfaces boosts Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics by inducing a built&#8208;in electric field and improves the reaction reversibility of SnO2. This work provides a new understanding of interface&#8211;performance relationship of metal&#8211;oxide hybrid electrodes and pivotal guidance for creating high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A PF6&#8722;&#8208;Permselective Polymer Electrolyte with Anion Solvation Regulation Enabling Long&#8208;Cycle Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PF6&#8722;&#8208;permselective polymer electrolyte with abundant quaternary ammonium motifs, which can facilitate PF6&#8722; desolvation and thus maintain the structural integrity of graphite during cycling, is designed for high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries. Besides, this design philosophy also improves oxidation resistance of electrolyte. Eventually, long&#8208;life 5.4&#160;V&#8208;class dual&#8208;ion batteries with superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) are achieved.








Abstract
Graphitic carbon that allows reversible anion (de)intercalation is a promising cathode material for cost&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). However, one notorious but overlooked issue is the incomplete interfacial anion desolvation, which not only reduces the oxidative stability of electrolytes, but also results in solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite layers. Here, an &#8220;anion&#8208;permselective&#8221; polymer electrolyte with abundant cationic quaternary ammonium motif is developed to weaken the PF6&#8722;&#8211;solvent interaction and thus facilitates PF6&#8722; desolvation. This strategy significantly inhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation as well as enhances the oxidation resistance of electrolyte, ensuring the structural integrity of graphite. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled graphite||Li cell achieves a superior cyclability with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.0% (vs 95.7% for baseline electrolyte) and 87.1% capacity retention after 2000 cycles even at a high cutoff potential of 5.4&#160;V versus Li+/Li. Besides, this polymer also forms a robust cathode electrolyte interface, working together to enable a long&#8208;life DIB. This strategy of tuning anion coordination environment provides a promising solution to regulate solvent co&#8208;intercalation chemistry for DIBs.

         <title>Differential Polymer Chain Scission Enables Free&#8208;Standing Microcavity Laser Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of differential polymer chain scission is developed to fabricate free&#8208;standing optical microcavities with high&#8208;quality factors by one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers. This strategy features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the free&#8208;standing optical microstructures, which significantly expands the application scope for versatile photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Control over material architectures is essential to the performance of photonic devices and systems. Optical isolation of the photonic materials from substrates can significantly enhance their performance but suffers from complicated fabrication processes and limited applications. Here a differential polymer chain scission strategy is proposed to fabricate free&#8208;standing photonic structures based on one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers (EOB). The polymer molecular mass&#8208;dependent sensitivity to electron beam enables differential patterning of the two layers of polymers, leading to the direct formation of suspended optical microcavities. The EOB technique features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the optical microcavities, which significantly expands the application scope of the suspended optical microcavities. As well as providing a versatile strategy for building high&#8208;performance photonic materials, the results provide a promising platform for innovative applications of optical microstructures.

         <title>Engineering Metallic Heterostructure Based on Ni3N and 2M&#8208;MoS2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis with Industry&#8208;Compatible Current Density and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of metallic nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide is designed and fabricated for large&#8208;current alkaline water electrolysis. The constructed water electrolyzer operates at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% current density retention over 300&#160;h, superior to the performance of commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis is commercially desirable to realize large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Although nonprecious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10&#8211;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), it is still challenging to achieve industrially&#160;required current density over 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, the authors design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;enable hydrogen production from Ni3N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2, which can efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi&#8208;level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni3N and Mo&#63743;Mo bonds of 2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;to boost overall water splitting. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% retention over 300&#160;h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).

         <title>Toward Exotic Layered Materials: 2D Cuprous Iodide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only a few dozen 2D crystals have been successfully prepared, though many more&#8212;including metal iodides&#8212;are predicted to exist. A major reason for this disparity is their instability under ambient conditions. A wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize 2D&#8208;CuI, stabilizing it by graphene encapsulation in a one&#8208;step process, is designed, and its chemical structure is imaged.








Abstract
Heterostructures composed of 2D materials are already opening many new possibilities in such fields of technology as electronics and magnonics, but far more could be achieved if the number and diversity of 2D materials were&#160;increased. So far, only a few dozen 2D crystals have been extracted from materials that exhibit a layered phase in ambient conditions, omitting entirely the large number of layered materials that may exist at other temperatures and pressures. This work demonstrates how such structures can be stabilized in 2D van der Waals (vdw) stacks under room temperature via growing them directly in graphene encapsulation by using graphene oxide as the template material. Specifically, an ambient stable 2D structure of copper and iodine, a material that normally only occurs in layered form at elevated temperatures between 645 and 675&#160;K, is produced. The results establish a simple route to the production of more exotic phases of materials that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to stabilize for experiments in&#160;ambient.

Anisotropic Ion Diffusion
An anisotropic ion diffusion process is developed, as reported by Masaya Fujioka and co&#8208;workers in article number 2106754. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity, by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.

Nanovaccines
A cancer cell membrane@porous silicon nanoparticles@Au nanovaccine is developed by Zhenyang Luo, H&#233;lder A. Santos, Bing Xia, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2108012, based on weak&#8208;immunostimulatory porous silicon@Au nanoparticulate cores and multi&#8208;antigenic cancer cell membranes. These exogenous nanovaccines boost antitumor immunity, preventing the occurrence of solid tumors, and significantly inhibiting the growth and metastasis of solid tumors after photothermal therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Santos, Bing Xia, and co-workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202108012"&gt;2108012&lt;/a&gt;, based on weak-immunostimulatory porous silicon@Au nanoparticulate cores and multi-antigenic cancer cell membranes. These exogenous nanovaccines boost antitumor immunity, preventing the occurrence of solid tumors, and significantly inhibiting the growth and metastasis of solid tumors after photothermal therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range&#8208;Ordered Assembly of Micro&#8208;/Nanostructures at Superwetting Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of solution&#8208;processable materials with regulated patterning, dimensions, and orientation lays foundation for the integration of high&#8208;performance devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art assembly methods developed based on superwetting interfaces are overviewed. The confined capillary liquids have been highlighted as a versatile and robust platform for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal nanoparticles.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of solution&#8208;processable materials imposes stringent and simultaneous requirements of controlled nucleation and growth, tunable geometry and dimensions, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly, which is challenging in solution process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Superwetting interfaces, underpinned by programmable surface chemistry and topography, are promising for steering transport, dewetting, and microfluid dynamics of liquids, thus opening a new paradigm for micro&#8208;/nanostructure assembly in solution process. Herein, assembly methods on the basis of superwetting interfaces are reviewed for constructing long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered micro&#8208;/nanostructures. Confined capillary liquids, including capillary bridges and capillary corner menisci realized by controlling local wettability and surface topography, are highlighted for simultaneously attained deterministic patterning and long&#8208;range order. The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single&#8208;crystalline micro&#8208;/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal&#8208;nanoparticle superlattices, which lead to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities. Finally, a perspective for promising directions in this realm is provided.

         <title>Fast Ionic Storage in Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion diffusion coefficients are highly related to the size and dimension of tunnels in materials, the radius of various ions, and the coinserted or lattice H2O molecules. Monovalent and divalent ions show significant differences in reaction kinetics in materials for their unique diffusion characteristics. Therefore, comprehensive review and prospects are provided for fast ionic storage in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The highly dynamic nature of grid&#8208;scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage solution for renewable&#8208;energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and 1D/2D/3D and over&#8208;3D&#8208;tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over&#8208;3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes are developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

         <title>KTaO3&#8212;The New Kid on the Spintronics Block</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
If a truly multifunctional material with a large spin&#8208;orbit coupling is looked for, it would be hard to beat KTaO3 (KTO). The 2D electron gas housed by KTO&#8208;based thin films and heterostructures exhibits spin&#8208;polarization, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, persistent photocurrent, etc., and provides a platform to realize exotic relativistic quantum particles. Read this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review for all the fascinating details.








Abstract
Long after the heady days of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity, the oxides came back into the limelight in 2004 with the discovery of the 2D electron gas (2DEG) in SrTiO3 (STO) and several heterostructures based on it. Not only do these materials exhibit interesting physics, but they have also opened up new vistas in oxide electronics and spintronics. However, much of the attention has recently shifted to KTaO3 (KTO), a material with all the &#8220;good&#8221; properties of STO (simple cubic structure, high mobility, etc.) but with the additional advantage of a much larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling. In this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review of the fascinating world of KTO, it is attempted to cover the remarkable progress made, particularly in the last five years. Certain unsolved issues are also indicated, while suggesting future research directions as well as potential applications. The range of physical phenomena associated with the 2DEG trapped at the interfaces of KTO&#8208;based heterostructures include spin polarization, superconductivity, quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, persistent photocurrent, Rashba effect, topological Hall effect, and inverse Edelstein Effect. It is aimed to discuss, on a single platform, the various fabrication techniques, the exciting physical properties and future application possibilities of this family of materials.
