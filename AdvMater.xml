         <title>Surface&#8208;Functionalized Microgels as Artificial Antigen&#8208;Presenting Cells to Regulate Expansion of T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) are currently used to manufacture T cells for adoptive therapy in cancer treatment, but a readily tunable and modular system could enable both rapid T cell expansion and control over T cell phenotype. Here, we show that microgels with tailored surface biochemical properties can serve as aAPCs to mediate T cell activation and expansion. Surface functionalization of microgels was achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coating using oppositely charged polymers, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. This facile and versatile approach is compatible with a variety of coating polymers and allows efficient and flexible surface&#8208;specific conjugation of defined peptides or proteins. We demonstrate that tethering appropriate stimulatory ligands on the microgel surface efficiently activates T cells for polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific expansion. The expansion, phenotype and functional outcome of primary mouse and human T cells can be regulated by modulating the concentration, ratio and distribution of stimulatory ligands presented on microgel surfaces as well as the stiffness and viscoelasticity of the microgels.

         <title>Scalable Approach to Molecular Motor&#8208;Polymer Conjugates for Light&#8208;Driven Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The integration of molecular machines and motors into materials represents a promising avenue for creating dynamic and functional molecular systems, with potential applications in soft robotics or reconfigurable biomaterials. However, the development of truly scalable and controllable approaches for incorporating molecular motors into polymeric matrices has remained a challenge. Here, we show that light&#8208;driven molecular motors with sensitive photo&#8208;isomerizable double bonds can be converted into initiators for Cu&#8208;mediated controlled/living radical polymerization enabling the synthesis of star&#8208;shaped motor&#8208;polymer conjugates. This approach enables scalability, precise control over molecular structure, block copolymer structures, and high end group fidelity. Moreover, we demonstrate that these materials can be crosslinked to form gels with quasi&#8208;ideal network topology, exhibiting light&#8208;triggered contraction. We investigate the influence of arm length and polymer structure, and develop the first molecular dynamics simulation framework to gain deeper insights into the contraction processes. Leveraging this scalable methodology, we showcase the creation of bilayer soft robotic devices and cargo&#8208;lifting artificial muscles, highlighting the versatility and potential applications of this advanced polymer chemistry approach. We anticipate that our integrated experimental and simulation framework will accelerate scalable approaches for active polymer materials based on molecular machines, opening up new horizons in materials science and bioscience.

         <title>Tuneable Current Rectification Through a Designer Graphene Nanoribbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic systems due to electron&#8208;hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule&#8208;metal interface. Here, we&#160;present a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally large rectification ratio (&gt;105) and reversible direction. The molecular system comprises a 7&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic precision on a gold substrate by on&#8208;surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates half&#8208;populated in&#8208;gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscope and the substrate, we&#160;demonstrate unipolar hole transport through the boron in&#8208;gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic&#160;electronics.

         <title>Ultimately Adaptive Fluid Interfacial Phospholipid Membranes Unveiled Unanticipated High Cellular Mechanical Work</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Living cells actively interact biochemically and mechanically with the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECMs) and undergo dramatic morphological and dimensional transitions, concomitantly remodeling ECMs. However, there is no suitable method to quantitatively discuss the contribution of mechanical interactions in such mutually adaptive processes. We herein developed a highly deformable &#8220;living&#8221; cellular scaffold to evaluate overall mechanical energy transfer between cell and ECMs. It is based on the water&#8208;perfluorocarbon interface decorated with phospholipids bearing a cell&#8208;adhesive ligand and fluorescent tag. The bioinert nature of the phospholipid membranes prevents the formation of solid&#8208;like protein nanofilms at the fluid interface, enabling us to visualize and quantify cellular mechanical work against the ultimately adaptive model ECM. A new cellular wetting regime was identified, wherein interface deformation proceeds to cell flattening, followed by its eventual restoration. The cellular mechanical work during this adaptive wetting process was one order of magnitude higher than those reported for conventional elastic platforms. The behavior of viscous liquid drops at the air&#8211;water interface can simulate cellular adaptive wetting, suggesting that overall viscoelasticity of the cell body predominates the emergent wetting regime and regulates mechanical output. Cellular force&#8208;driven high&#8208;energy states on the adaptive platform can be useful for cell fate manipulation.

         <title>Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Modules for Efficient and Reliable Low&#8208;Grade Heat Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;telluride&#8208;based alloy has long been considered as the most promising candidate for low&#8208;grade waste heat power generation. However, optimizing the thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;type Bi2Te3 is more challenging than that of p&#8208;type counterparts due to its greater sensitivity to texture, and thus limits the advancement of thermoelectric modules. Herein, we enhance the thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;type Bi2Te3 by incorporating a small amount of CuGaTe2, resulting in a peak ZT of 1.25 and a distinguished average ZT of 1.02 (300&#8208;500 K). The decomposed Cu+ strengthens interlayer interaction, while Ga+ optimizes carrier concentration within an appropriate range. Simultaneously, the emerged numerous defects, such as small&#8208;angle grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and dislocations, significantly suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity. Based on the size optimization by finite element modelling, the constructed thermoelectric module yields a high conversion efficiency of 6.9% and output power density of 0.31&#160;W cm&#8722;2 under a temperature gradient of 200 K. Even more crucially, the efficiency and output power little loss after subjecting the module to 40 thermal cycles lasting for 6 days. Our study demonstrates the efficient and reliable Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric modules for broad applications in low&#8208;grade heat harvest.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (PO&#8208;TSCs) demonstrate exceptional suitability for emerging applications such as building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, wearable devices, and greenhouse farming. By leveraging the distinctive attributes of perovskite and organic materials, which encompass expanded solar spectrum utilization, chemically benign solubility, and soft nature, PO&#8208;TSCs position themselves as ideal candidates for high&#8208;performance semi&#8208;transparent photovoltaics (ST&#8208;PVs). Despite these advantages, their development significantly lags behind other perovskite&#8208;based counterparts, such as perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, and perovskite/Cu(In, Ga)Se2. To address existing challenges and unlock the full potential of PO&#8208;TSCs, we embark on an exploration of the fundamental mechanisms governing tandem photovoltaic devices. Delving into critical aspects such as charge generation/separation, energy level alignment, and material choices becomes pivotal for optimizing PO&#8208;TSC performance. The investigation of monolithic 2&#8208;terminal PO&#8208;TSCs offers insights into achievements and barriers, recognizing the competitive landscape with other TSC counterparts. Further scrutiny of perovskite absorbers and organic absorbers in TSCs reveals strategies aimed at enhancing stability and efficiency. The discussion extends to interconnection layers, elucidating their role in optimizing light transmission and balancing carrier recombination. In conclusion, we present a compelling outlook on the dynamic landscape of PO&#8208;TSCs, highlighting the remarkable efficiency progression and signaling their potential to revolutionize solar energy harvesting technologies.

Abstract
Corrosion activities and biofouling pose significant challenges for marine facilities, resulting in substantial economic losses. Inspired by the &#8220;brick&amp;mortar&#8221; structure of pearls, a novel nanocomposite coating (Pun&#8208;HJTx) with long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;corrosion and intelligent antifouling modes is fabricated by integrating a compatible MoS2/MXene heterostructure as the &#8220;brick&#8221; into a polyurea&#8208;modified PDMS (Pun) acting as &#8220;mortar&#8221;. Notably, the presence of multiple hydrogen bonds within the coating effectively reduces the pinholes resulted from solution volatilizing. In the dark, where fouling adhesion and microbial corrosion activities are weakened, the MoS2/MXene plays a role in contact bactericidal action. Conversely, during daylight when fouling adhesion and microbial corrosion activities intensify, the coating releases reactive oxygen species (such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide ions) to counteract fouling adhesion. Additionally, the coating exhibits multi&#8208;source self&#8208;healing performance under heated or exposed to light (maximum self&#8208;healing rate can reach 99.46%) and proves efficient self&#8208;cleaning performance and adhesion strength (&gt;2.0 Mpa), making it highly suitable for various practical marine applications. Furthermore, the outstanding performance of the Pun&#8208;HJT1 is maintained for approximately 180 days in real&#8208;world marine conditions, which proving its practicality and feasibility in real shallow sea environments.

         <title>Optimizing Ultra&#8208;thin 2D Transistors for Monolithic 3D Integration: A Study on Directly Grown Nanocrystalline Interconnects and Buried Contacts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The potential of monolithic 3D integration technology is largely dependent on the enhancement of interconnect characteristics which can lead to thinner stacks, better heat dissipation, and reduced signal delays. Carbon materials such as graphene, characterized by sp2 hybridized carbons, are promising candidates for future interconnects due to their exceptional electrical, thermal conductivity and resistance to electromigration. However, a significant challenge lies in achieving low contact resistance between extremely thin semiconductor channels and graphitic materials. To address this issue, we propose an innovative wafer&#8208;scale synthesis approach that enables low contact resistance between dry&#8208;transferred 2D semiconductors and as&#8208;grown nanocrystalline graphitic interconnects. A hybrid graphitic interconnect with metal doping reduced the sheet resistance by 84% compared to an equivalent thickness metal&#8208;film. Furthermore, the introduction of a buried graphitic contact resulted in a contact resistance that is 17&#8208;times lower than that of bulk metal contacts (&gt;40&#160;nm). Transistors with this optimal structure were used to successfully demonstrate a simple logic function. The thickness of active layer was maintained within sub&#8208;7&#160;nm range, encompassing both channels and contacts. The ultra&#8208;thin transistor and interconnect stack developed in this work, characterized by a readily etchable interlayer and low parasitic resistance, leads to heterogeneous integration of future 3D ICs.

         <title>Reconciling the Cooperative&#8208;Competitive Patterns among Tumor and Immune Cells for Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer Treatment Using Multimodule Nanocomplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Targeting the competitive&#8208;cooperative relationships among tumor cells and various immune cells can efficiently reverse the immune&#8208;dysfunction microenvironment to boost the immunotherapies for the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer treatment. Hence, a bacterial outer membrane vesicle&#8208;based nanocomplex is designed for specifically targeting malignant cells and immune cells to reconcile the relationships based on metabolic&#8208;immune crosstalk. By uniquely utilizing the property of charge&#8208;reversal polymers to realize function separation, the nanocomplexes could synergistically regulate tumor cells and immune cells. This approach could reshape the immunosuppressive competition&#8208;cooperation pattern into one that is immune&#8208;responsive, showcasing significant potential for inducing tumor remission in TNBC models.

         <title>Silver Copper Chalcogenide Thermoelectrics: Advance, Controversy, and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric technology, which enables a direct and pollution&#8208;free conversion of heat into electricity, provides a promising path to address the current global energy crisis. Among the broad range of thermoelectric materials, silver copper chalcogenides (AgCuQ, Q = S, Se, Te) have garnered significant attention in thermoelectric community in light of inherently ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity, controllable electronic transport properties, excellent thermoelectric performance across various temperature ranges, and a degree of ductility. This review epitomizes the recent progress in AgCuQ&#8208;based thermoelectric materials, from the optimization of thermoelectric performance to the rational design of devices, encompassing the fundamental understanding of crystal structures, electronic band structures, mechanical properties, and quasi&#8208;liquid behaviors. The correlation between chemical composition, mechanical properties, and thermoelectric performance in this material system is also highlighted. Finally, several key issues and prospects are proposed targeting further optimizing AgCuQ&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Nanomedicine Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomedicine is a popular and productive research field. Nanomedicine formulations are widely explored to improve tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery and anticancer treatment efficacy. The clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines has been lagging behind expectations, for several reasons. This perspective paper discusses the basic principles, relevant recent progress, currently used clinical products, prominent problems, and most promising future prospects of cancer nanomedicine.








Abstract
Nanomedicines are extensively explored for cancer therapy. By delivering drug molecules more efficiently to pathological sites and by attenuating their accumulation in healthy organs and tissues, nanomedicine formulations aim to improve the balance between drug efficacy and toxicity. More than 20 cancer nanomedicines are approved for clinical use, and hundreds of formulations are in (pre)clinical development. Over the years, several key pitfalls have been identified as bottlenecks in nanomedicine tumor targeting and translation. These go beyond materials&#8208; and production&#8208;related issues, and particularly also encompass biological barriers and pathophysiological heterogeneity. In this manuscript, the author describes the most important principles, progress, and products in nanomedicine tumor targeting, delineates key current problems and challenges, and discuss the most promising future prospects to create clinical impact.

Porous carbonaceous sphere derived from cobalt metal&#8211;organic frameworks is suggested to develop multimodal electro&#8208;ionic and magnetoactive soft actuators with expanded bandwidth and strong force actuation. These actuators are then utilized to demonstrate the high&#8208;frequency motion of a balancing bird and a dynamic eagle robot having a magneto&#8208;responsive claw.








Abstract
The advancement of&#160;active electrode&#160;materials&#160;is&#160;essential&#160;to&#160;meet&#160;the demand for multifaceted soft robotic interactions.&#160;In&#160;this&#160;study, a new type of porous carbonaceous sphere (PCS) for a multimodal soft actuator capable of both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic responses is reported. The PCS, derived from the simultaneous oxidative and reductive breakdown of specially designed cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Co&#8208;MOFs) with varying metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios, exhibits a high specific surface area of 529 m2 g&#8722;1 and a saturated magnetization of 142.7 Am2 kg&#8722;1. The size of the PCS can be controlled through the Ostwald ripening mechanism, while the porous structure can be regulated by adjusting the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand mol ratio. Its exceptional compatibility with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylene&#8208;dioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate)&#160;enables the creation of uniform electrode, crucial for producing soft actuators that work in both magnetic and electrical fields. Operated at an ultralow voltage of 1&#160;V, the PCS&#8208;based actuator generates a blocking force of 47.5 mN and exhibits significant bending deflection even at an oscillation frequency of 10&#160;Hz. Employing this simultaneous multimodal actuation ensures the dynamic and complex motions of a balancing bird robot and a dynamic eagle robot. This advancement marks a significant step toward the realization of more dynamic and versatile soft robotic systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material technology presents great potentials in leukemia treatment. This review summarizes the types, physicochemical properties, as well as functions of various materials generally utilized in leukemia treatments, and highlights the current applications of these materials in diverse leukemia treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, radiotherapy, reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;based therapy, and combined therapy.








Abstract
Leukemia is a widespread hematological malignancy characterized by an elevated white blood cell count in both the blood and the bone marrow. Despite notable advancements in leukemia intervention in the clinic, a large proportion of patients, especially acute leukemia patients, fail to achieve long&#8208;term remission or complete remission following treatment. Therefore, leukemia therapy necessitates optimization to meet the treatment requirements. In recent years, a multitude of materials have undergone rigorous study to serve as delivery vectors or direct intervention agents to bolster the effectiveness of leukemia therapy. These materials include liposomes, protein&#8208;based materials, polymeric materials, cell&#8208;derived materials, and inorganic materials. They possess unique characteristics and are applied in a broad array of therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and other evolving treatments. Here, an overview of these materials is presented, describing their physicochemical properties, their role in leukemia treatment, and the challenges they face in the context of clinical translation. This review inspires researchers to further develop various materials that can be used to augment the efficacy of multiple therapeutic modalities for novel applications in leukemia treatment.

         <title>Hierarchical Piezoelectric Composites for Noninvasive Continuous Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a hierarchical composite with impressive piezoelectric performances for noninvasive continuous blood pressure monitoring and hemodynamic parameter collection with accuracy comparable to clinical results. It is expected to empower both patients and clinicians with referable hemodynamic information, thus facilitating early diagnosis and effective management of cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and multiparametric analysis of cardiac functions are crucial for the early diagnosis and therapy of cardiovascular diseases. However, existing monitoring approaches often suffer from bulky and intrusive apparatus, cumbersome testing procedures, and challenging data processing, hampering their applications in continuous monitoring. Here, a heterogeneously hierarchical piezoelectric composite is introduced for wearable continuous BP and cardiac function monitoring, overcoming the rigidity of ceramic and the insensitivity of polymer. By optimizing the hierarchical structure and components of the composite, the developed piezoelectric sensor delivers impressive performances, ensuring continuous and accurate monitoring of BP at Grade A level. Furthermore, the hemodynamic parameters are extracted from the detected signals, such as local pulse wave velocity, cardiac output, and stroke volume, all of which are in alignment with clinical results. Finally, the all&#8208;day tracking of cardiac function parameters validates the reliability and stability of the developed sensor, highlighting its potential for personalized healthcare systems, particularly in early diagnosis and timely intervention of cardiovascular disease.

         <title>The Role of Side Chains and Hydration on Mixed Charge Transport in n&#8208;Type Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most conjugated polymers require polar ethylene glycol (EG) side chains for mixed ion&#8208;electron conduction. Yet, this study finds that longer EG chains reduce transport efficiency in n&#8208;type conductors. Using various in situ techniques, this study highlights swelling's detrimental effect on mixed charge transport. Surprisingly, n&#8208;type films maintain mixed conduction even without a crystalline phase.








Abstract
Introducing ethylene glycol (EG) side chains to a conjugated polymer backbone is a well&#8208;established synthetic strategy for designing organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs). However, the impact that film swelling has on mixed conduction properties has yet to be scoped, particularly for electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) OMIECs. Here, the authors investigate the effect of the length of branched EG chains on mixed charge transport of n&#8208;type OMIECs based on a naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxylic&#8208;diimide&#8208;bithiophene backbone. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are used to establish the similarities between the common&#8208;backbone films in dry conditions. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D) and in situ GIWAXS measurements reveal stark changes in film swelling properties and microstructure during electrochemical doping, depending on the side chain length. It is found that even in the loss of the crystallite content upon contact with the aqueous electrolyte, the films can effectively transport charges and that it is rather the high water content that harms the electronic interconnectivity within the OMIEC films. These results highlight the importance of controlling water uptake in the films to impede charge transport in n&#8208;type electrochemical devices.

         <title>Nondestructive Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Thick Crystallographic Scanner via Sticky&#8208;Note&#8208;Like van der Waals Assembling&#8211;Disassembling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nondestructive crystallographic scanning technique for 2D materials is developed, leveraging sticky&#8208;note&#8208;like van der Waals assembling&#8211;disassembling. This method visualizes the detailed crystallography of each grain within polycrystalline graphene using a single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick single&#8208;crystalline graphene and Raman signals varying dependent on interlayer twist angles. It facilitates a deeper understanding of 2D material properties, promoting further material engineering and optimization breakthroughs.








Abstract
Crystallographic characteristics, including grain boundaries and crystallographic orientation of each grain, are crucial in defining the properties of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs). To date, local microstructure analysis of 2DMs, which requires destructive and complex processes, is primarily used to identify unknown 2DM specimens, hindering the subsequent use of characterized samples. Here, a nondestructive large&#8208;area 2D crystallographic analytical method through sticky&#8208;note&#8208;like van der Waals (vdW) assembling&#8211;disassembling is presented. By the vdW assembling of veiled polycrystalline graphene (PCG) with a single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick single&#8208;crystalline graphene filter (SCG&#8208;filter), detailed crystallographic information of each grain in PCGs is visualized through a 2D Raman signal scan, which relies on the interlayer twist angle. The scanned PCGs are seamlessly separated from the SCG&#8208;filter using vdW disassembling, preserving their original condition. The remaining SCG&#8208;filter is then reused for additional crystallographic scans of other PCGs. It is believed that the methods can pave the way for advances in the crystallographic analysis of single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick materials, offering huge implications for the applications of 2DMs.

         <title>Programmable, High&#8208;resolution Printing of Spatially Graded Perovskites for Multispectral Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step in situ mixing and printing of micro/nanostructured perovskites with arbitrary spatial gradients with ultrahigh resolution (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) is introduced for the first time, and high&#8208;performance multispectral photodetectors (Responsivity:&#160;69.88 A W&#8722;1, Detectivity: 3.27 &#215; 1015 Jones) are constructed, opening new avenues for the fabrication of miniaturized perovskite spectrometer and hyperspectral imaging sensors.








Abstract
Micro/nanostructured perovskites with spatially graded compositions and bandgaps are promising in filter&#8208;free, chip&#8208;level multispectral, and hyperspectral detection. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution patterning of perovskites with controlled graded compositions is challenging. Here, a programmable mixed electrohydrodynamic printing (M&#8208;ePrinting) technique is presented to realize the one&#8208;step direct&#8208;printing of arbitrary spatially graded perovskite micro/nanopatterns for the first time. M&#8208;ePrinting enables in situ mixing and ejection of solutions with controlled composition/bandgap by programmatically varying driving voltage applied to a multichannel nozzle. Composition can be graded over a single dot, line or complex pattern, and the printed feature size is down to 1&#160;&#181;m, which is the highest printing resolution of graded patterns to the knowledge. Photodetectors based on micro/nanostructured perovskites with halide ions gradually varying from Br to I are constructed, which successfully achieve multispectral detection and full&#8208;color imaging, with a high detectivity and responsivity of 3.27 &#215; 1015 Jones and 69.88 A W&#8722;1, respectively. The presented method provides a versatile and competitive approach for such miniaturized bandgap&#8208;tunable perovskite spectrometer platforms and artificial vision systems, and also opens new avenues for the digital fabrication of composition&#8208;programmable structures.

         <title>Guest Acceptors with Lower Electrostatic Potential in Ternary Organic Solar Cells for Minimizing Voltage Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key strategy for predicting efficient guest components to minimize voltage losses in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) is demonstrated. The larger electrostatic potential (ESP) difference between the guest acceptor and the host acceptor, the smaller non&#8208;radiative voltage losses.








Abstract
The ternary strategy, in which one guest component is introduced into one host binary system, is considered to be one of the most effective ways to realize high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, there is no efficient method to predict the effectiveness of guest components in ternary OSCs. Herein, three guest compositions (i.e., ANF&#8208;1, ANF&#8208;2 and ANF&#8208;3) with different electrostatic potential (ESP) are designed and synthesized by modulating the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the terminal groups through density functional theory simulations. The effects of the introduction of guest component into the host system (D18:N3) on the photovoltaic properties are investigated. The theoretical and experimental studies provide a key rule for guest acceptor in ternary OSCs to improve the open&#8208;circuit voltage, that is, the larger ESP difference between the guest and host acceptor, the stronger the intermolecular interactions and the higher the miscibility, which improves the luminescent efficiency of the blend film and the electroluminescence quantum yield (EQEEL) of the device by reducing the aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching, thereby effectively decreasing the non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of ternary OSCs. This work will greatly contribute to the development of highly efficient guest components, thereby promoting the rapid breakthrough of the 20% efficiency bottleneck for single&#8208;junction OSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofibers provide a promising platform for piezo&#8208;/triboelectric nanogenerators for cutting&#8208;edge wearable technologies. This review highlights the unique wearable advantages of nanofibers, discusses the novel design of electroactive polymers and structure assemblies based on 1D micro/nanostructures, 2D bionic structures, and 3D multilayered structures for versatile functional applications. Alongside the emerging trends are proposed for the development of intelligent wearables.








Abstract
Over the past few decades, significant progress in piezo&#8208;/triboelectric nanogenerators (PTEGs) has led to the development of cutting&#8208;edge wearable technologies. Nanofibers with good designability, controllable morphologies, large specific areas, and unique physicochemical properties provide a promising platform for PTEGs for various advanced applications. However, the further development of nanofiber&#8208;based PTEGs is limited by technical difficulties, ranging from materials design to device integration. Herein, the current developments in PTEGs based on electrospun nanofibers are systematically reviewed. This review begins with the mechanisms of PTEGs and the advantages of nanofibers and nanodevices, including high breathability, waterproofness, scalability, and thermal&#8211;moisture comfort. In terms of materials and structural design, novel electroactive nanofibers and structure assemblies based on 1D micro/nanostructures, 2D bionic structures, and 3D multilayered structures are discussed. Subsequently, nanofibrous PTEGs in applications such as energy harvesters, personalized medicine, personal protective equipment, and human&#8211;machine interactions are summarized. Nanofiber&#8208;based PTEGs still face many challenges such as energy efficiency, material durability, device stability, and device integration. Finally, the research gap between research and practical applications of PTEGs is discussed, and emerging trends are proposed, providing some ideas for the development of intelligent wearables.

         <title>Alternative Concepts for Extruded Power Cable Insulation: from Thermosets to Thermoplastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked polyethylene is the most widely used insulation material for extruded high&#8208;voltage power cables. This perspective explores alternative concepts such as click chemistry type curing, polyolefin blends and adaptable networks, which avoid hazardous crosslinking agents and the release of harmful byproducts. Moreover, insulation materials that remain thermoplastic may ease reprocessing once the cable has reached the end of its lifetime.








Abstract
The most common type of insulation of extruded high&#8208;voltage power cables is composed of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), which must be crosslinked to adjust its thermomechanical properties. A major drawback is the need for hazardous curing agents and the release of harmful curing byproducts during cable production, while the thermoset nature complicates reprocessing of the insulation material. This perspective explores recent progress in the development of alternative concepts that allow to avoid byproducts through either click chemistry type curing of polyethylene&#8208;based copolymers or the use of polyolefin blends or copolymers, which entirely removes the need for crosslinking. Moreover, polypropylene&#8208;based thermoplastic formulations enable the design of insulation materials that can withstand higher cable operating temperatures and facilitate reprocessing by remelting once the cable reaches the end of its lifetime. Finally, polyethylene&#8208;based covalent and non&#8208;covalent adaptable networks are explored, which may allow to combine the advantages of thermoset and thermoplastic insulation materials in terms of thermomechanical properties and reprocessability.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Flexible Carbon Nanofilms with Synergistically Enhanced Transmittance and Conductivity Prepared by Reorganizing Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel facet&#8208;driven carbon nanotube network reorganization method is developed to prepare large&#8208;area flexible freestanding transparent and conductive carbon nanofilms with synergistic enhancement of multiple properties, such as mechanical strength, transmittance and conductivity, and the area up to A3 size and even meter&#8208;length. Based on the film, a new smart window is fabricated.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area flexible transparent conductive films (TCFs) are highly desired for future electronic devices. Nanocarbon TCFs are one of the most promising candidates, but some of their properties are mutually restricted. Here, a novel carbon nanotube network reorganization (CNNR) strategy, that is, the facet&#8208;driven CNNR (FD&#8208;CNNR) technique, is presented to overcome this intractable contradiction. The FD&#8208;CNNR technique introduces an interaction between single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and Cu&#9472;&#8208;O. Based on the unique FD&#8208;CNNR mechanism, large&#8208;area flexible reorganized carbon nanofilms (RNC&#8208;TCFs) are designed and fabricated with A3&#8208;size and even meter&#8208;length, including reorganized SWNT (RSWNT) films and graphene and RSWNT (G&#8208;RSWNT) hybrid films. Synergistic improvement in strength, transmittance, and conductivity of flexible RNC&#8208;TCFs is achieved. The G&#8208;RSWNT TCF shows sheet resistance as low as 69&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1 at 86% transmittance, FOM value of 35, and Young's modulus of &#8776;45&#160;MPa. The high strength enables RNC&#8208;TCFs to be freestanding on water and easily transferred to any target substrate without contamination. A4&#8208;size flexible smart window is fabricated, which manifests controllable dimming and fog removal. The FD&#8208;CNNR technique can be extended to large&#8208;area or even large&#8208;scale fabrication of TCFs and can provide new insights into the design of TCFs and other functional films.

The G-RSWNT TCF shows sheet resistance as low as 69&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 86% transmittance, FOM value of 35, and Young's modulus of &#8776;45&#160;MPa. The high strength enables RNC-TCFs to be freestanding on water and easily transferred to any target substrate without contamination. A4-size flexible smart window is fabricated, which manifests controllable dimming and fog removal. The FD-CNNR technique can be extended to large-area or even large-scale fabrication of TCFs and can provide new insights into the design of TCFs and other functional films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Succinonitrile&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Intrinsically Safe High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the high flammability of conventional electrolytes may pose serious safety threats and even explosions. Herein, we propose a strategy of constructing a deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) to boost the safety and electrochemical performance of succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based electrolyte. The strong hydrogen bond between S = O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide (DTD) and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN endows the enhanced safety and compatibility of SN with Lewis bases. Meanwhile, the DTD participates in the inner Na+ sheath and weakens the coordination number of SN. The unique solvation configuration promotes the formation of robust gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, and merits stable cycling of half cells in a wide temperature range, with a capacity retention of 82.8% after 800 cycles (25&#160;&#176;C) and 86.3% after 100 cycles (60&#160;&#176;C). Correspondingly, the full cells deliver tremendous improvement in cycling stability and rate performance.

Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown great potential in X&#8208;ray detection due to outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, finding a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally sustainable method for handling end&#8208;of&#8208;life devices has remained challenging. Here, we introduce a &#8220;One&#8208;Click Restart&#8221; eco&#8208;friendly recycling strategy for end&#8208;of&#8208;life perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. This method, utilizing water, allows for the recapture and reuse of both perovskite and conductor materials. The process is straightforward and environmentally friendly, eliminating the need for further chemical treatment, purification, additional additives or catalysts, and complex equipment. We developed a sustainable device cycle by reconstructing flexible perovskite membranes for wearable electronics from recycled materials. Large&#8208;scale, flexible membranes made from metal&#8208;free perovskite DABCO&#8208;N2H5&#8208;I3 (DABCO = N&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) achieve remarkably impressive average sensitivity of 6204 &#177; 268 &#956;C Gyair&#8211;1&#160;cm&#8211;2 and a low detection limit of 102.3 nGyair s&#8211;1 at 50&#160;V bias, which makes highly effective for X&#8208;ray imaging. The sensitivity of recycled flexible devices not only matches that of single&#8208;crystal devices made with fresh materials but also ranks as the highest among all metal&#8208;free perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. &#8220;One&#8208;Click Restart&#8221; applied to scalable flexible devices derived from aged single&#8208;crystal counterparts, offering significant cost, time, and energy savings compared to their single&#8208;crystal equivalents. Such advantages significantly boost future market competitiveness.

         <title>Optically Tunable Electrical Oscillations in Oxide&#8208;Based Memristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports light&#8208;control of an oxide&#8208;based relaxation oscillator based on the photothermal response of V3O5, a material that undergoes an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition at temperatures above &#8776;420 K.&#160; The research advances the understanding of V3O5 as a functional material, and demonstrates its potential as the basis of a solid&#8208;state sensory neuron for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The application of hardware&#8208;based neural networks can be enhanced by integrating sensory neurons and synapses that enable direct input from external stimuli. This work reports direct optical control of an oscillatory neuron based on volatile threshold switching in V3O5. The devices exhibit electroforming&#8208;free operation with switching parameters that can be tuned by optical illumination. Using temperature&#8208;dependent electrical measurements, conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), in situ thermal imaging, and lumped element modelling, it is shown that the changes in switching parameters, including threshold and hold voltages, arise from overall conductivity increase of the oxide film due to the contribution of both photoconductive and bolometric characteristics of V3O5, which eventually affects the oscillation dynamics. Furthermore, V3O5 is identified as a new bolometric material with a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) as high as &#8722;4.6% K&#8722;1 at 423 K. The utility of these devices&#160;is illustrated by demonstrating in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing with reduced computational effort and an optical encoding layer for spiking neural network (SNN), respectively, using a simulated array of devices.

         <title>Wearable Coaxially&#8208;Shielded Metamaterial for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from commercial coaxial cable, a wireless, flexible, lightweight, and cheap metamaterial with an internal coaxially&#8208;shielded structure, confining electric field within while possessing a predominant magnetic response for magnetic resonance imaging is constructed. The metamaterial is capable of achieving a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio comparable to or surpass that of commercial receive coil arrays in some aspects.








Abstract
Recent advancements in metamaterials have yielded the possibility of a wireless solution to improve signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unlike traditional closely packed local coil arrays with rigid designs and numerous components, these lightweight, cost&#8208;effective metamaterials eliminate the need for radio frequency cabling, baluns, adapters, and interfaces. However, their clinical adoption is limited by their low sensitivity, bulky physical footprint, and limited, specific use cases. Herein, a wearable metamaterial developed using commercially available coaxial cable, designed for a 3.0&#160;T MRI system is introduced. This metamaterial inherits the coaxially&#8208;shielded structure of its constituent cable, confining the electric field within and mitigating coupling to its surroundings. This ensures safer clinical adoption, lower signal loss, and resistance to frequency shifts. Weighing only 50&#160;g, the metamaterial maximizes its sensitivity by conforming to the anatomical region of interest. MRI images acquired using this metamaterial with various pulse sequences achieve an SNR comparable or even surpass that of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 16&#8208;channel knee coil. This work introduces a novel paradigm for constructing metamaterials in the MRI environment, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation wireless MRI technology.

         <title>Hybrid&#8208;Electrolytes System Established by Dual Super&#8208;lyophobic Membrane Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes and related aqueous rechargeable batteries own unique advantage on safety and environmental friendliness, but coupling high energy density Li&#8208;metal batteries with aqueous electrolyte still represent challenging and not yet reported. Here, we make a breakthrough in &#8220;high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;metal batteries&#8221; (HVALMBs) by adopting a brilliant hybrid&#8208;electrolytes strategy. Concentrated ternary&#8208;salts ether&#8208;based electrolyte (CTE) acts as the anolyte to ensure the stability and reversibility of Li&#8208;metal plating/stripping. Eco&#8208;friendly water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WiS) electrolyte acts as catholyte to support the healthy operation of high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Most importantly, the aqueous catholyte and non&#8208;aqueous anolyte are isolated in each independent chamber without any crosstalk. Aqueous catholyte permeation toward Li anode can be completely prohibited without proton&#8208;induced corrosion, which is enabled by the introduction of under&#8208;liquid dual super&#8208;lyophobic membrane&#8208;based separator, which can realize the segregation of the most effective immiscible electrolytes with a surface tension difference as small as 6 mJ m&#8722;2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous electrolytes and related aqueous rechargeable batteries own unique advantage on safety and environmental friendliness, but coupling high energy density Li-metal batteries with aqueous electrolyte still represent challenging and not yet reported. Here, we make a breakthrough in &#8220;high-voltage aqueous Li-metal batteries&#8221; (HVALMBs) by adopting a brilliant hybrid-electrolytes strategy. Concentrated ternary-salts ether-based electrolyte (CTE) acts as the anolyte to ensure the stability and reversibility of Li-metal plating/stripping. Eco-friendly water-in-salt (WiS) electrolyte acts as catholyte to support the healthy operation of high-voltage cathodes. Most importantly, the aqueous catholyte and non-aqueous anolyte are isolated in each independent chamber without any crosstalk. Aqueous catholyte permeation toward Li anode can be completely prohibited without proton-induced corrosion, which is enabled by the introduction of under-liquid dual super-lyophobic membrane-based separator, which can realize the segregation of the most effective immiscible electrolytes with a surface tension difference as small as 6 mJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, the aqueous electrolyte can be successfully coupled with Li-metal anode and achieve the fabrication of HVALMBs (hybrid-electrolytes system), which presents long-term cycle stability with a capacity retention of 81.0% after 300 cycles (LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || Li (limited) cell) and high energy density (682&#160;Wh/kg).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Machine Learning to Promote Efficient Screening of Low&#8208;Contact Electrode for Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductor Transistor Under Limited Data</title>

Abstract
Low&#8208;barrier and high&#8208;injection electrodes are crucial for high&#8208;performance two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor devices. Conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodologies for electrode material screening are impractical because of their low efficiency and arbitrary specificity. Although machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative to tackle this problem, its practical application in semiconductor devices has been hindered by its substantial data requirements. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive scheme combining an autoencoding regularized adversarial neural network and a feature&#8208;adaptive variational active learning algorithm for screening low&#8208;contact electrode materials for two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor transistors with limited data. The proposed scheme exhibits exceptional performance by training with only 15% of the total data points, where the mean square errors are 0.17 and 0.27&#160;eV for the vertical and lateral Schottky barrier, respectively, and 2.88% for tunneling probability. Further, it exhibits an optimal predictive performance for 100 randomly sampled training datasets, reveals the underlying physical insight based on the identified features, and realizes continual improvement by employing detailed density&#8208;of&#8208;states descriptors. Finally, the empirical evaluations of the transport characteristics are conducted and verified by constructing MOSFET devices. These findings demonstrate the considerable potential of machine&#8208;learning techniques for screening high&#8208;efficiency electrode materials and constructing high&#8208;performance two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor devices.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Rectified Gradient Porous Polymeric Film for Solar&#8208;Thermal Regulatory Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal regulation concerning thermal insulation and solar modulation is pivotal for cooling textiles and smart buildings.&#160;Nevertheless, a contradiction arises in balancing the demand to prevent external heat infiltration with the efficient dissipation of excess heat from enclosed spaces. Here, a concentration&#8208;gradient polymerization strategy is presented for fabricating a gradient porous polymeric film comprising interconnected polymeric microspheres. This method involves establishing an electric field&#8208;driven gradient distribution of charged crosslinkers in the precursor solution, followed by subsequent polymerization and freeze&#8208;drying processes. The resulting porous film exhibits a significant porosity gradient along its thickness, leading to exceptional unidirectional thermal insulation capabilities with a thermal rectification factor of 21%. The gradient porous film, with its thermal rectification properties, effectively reconciles the conflicting demands of diverse thermal conductivity for cooling unheated and spontaneously heated enclosed spaces. Consequently, the gradient porous film demonstrates remarkable enhancements in solar&#8208;thermal management, achieving temperature reductions of 3.0 and 4.1&#160;&#176;C for unheated and spontaneously heated enclosed spaces, respectively, compared to uniform porous films. The developed gradient&#8208;structured porous film thus holds promise for the development of thermal&#8208;rectified materials tailored to regulate solar&#8208;thermal conditions within enclosed environments.

         <title>Mechanical and Functional Responses in Astrocytes under Alternating Deformation Modes Using Magneto&#8208;Active Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This work introduces NeoMag, a system designed to enhance cell mechanics assays in substrate deformation studies. NeoMag uses multidomain magneto&#8208;active materials to mechanically actuate the substrate, transmitting reversible mechanical cues to cells. The system boasts full flexibility in alternating loading substrate deformation modes, seamlessly adapting to both upright and inverted microscopes. The multidomain substrates facilitate mechanobiology assays on 2D and 3D cultures. The integration of the system with nanoindenters allows for precise evaluation of cellular mechanical properties under varying substrate deformation modes. The system was used to study the impact of substrate deformation on astrocytes, simulating mechanical conditions akin to traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke. The results reveal local heterogeneous changes in astrocyte stiffness, influenced by the orientation of subcellular regions relative to substrate strain. These stiffness variations, exceeding 50% in stiffening and softening, and local deformations significantly alter calcium dynamics. Furthermore, sustained deformations induce actin network reorganisation and activate Piezo1 channels, leading to an initial increase followed by a long&#8208;term inhibition of calcium events. Conversely, fast and dynamic deformations transiently activate Piezo1 channels and disrupt the actin network, causing long&#8208;term cell softening. These findings unveil mechanical and functional alterations in astrocytes during substrate deformation, illustrating the multiple opportunities this technology offers.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Compatible Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions with a SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Composite Barrier as Low&#8208;Voltage and Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Speed Memristors</title>

         <dc:description>
For the first time, a sub&#8208;nanosecond switching speed of 500&#160;ps is demonstrated in HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectric tunnel junctions with a SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 composite barrier. The memristors show a low write current density, long retention, high endurance, 8 discrete and 128 gradually tunable conductance states, promising for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memories and memristive synapses.








Abstract
The big data era requires ultrafast, low&#8208;power, and silicon&#8208;compatible materials and devices for information storage and processing. Here, ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) based on SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 composite barrier and both conducting electrodes are designed and fabricated on Si substrates. The FTJ achieves the fastest write speed of 500&#160;ps under 5&#160;V (2 orders of magnitude faster than reported silicon&#8208;compatible FTJs) or 10&#160;ns speed at a low voltage of 1.5&#160;V (the lowest voltage among FTJs at similar speeds), low write current density of 1.3 &#215; 104 A cm&#8722;2, 8 discrete states, good retention &gt;&#160;105 s at 85&#160;&#176;C, and endurance &gt;&#160;107. In addition, it provides a large read current (88 A cm&#8722;2) at 0.1&#160;V, 2 orders of magnitude larger than reported FTJs. Interestingly, in FTJ&#8208;based synapses, gradually tunable conductance states (128 states) with high linearity (&lt;1) are obtained by 10&#160;ns pulses of &lt;1.2&#160;V, and a high accuracy of 91.8% in recognizing fashion product images is achieved by online neural network simulations. These results highlight that silicon&#8208;compatible HfO2&#8208;based FTJs are promising for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memories and electrical synapses.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoadjuvant is developed to sensitize cancer radiotherapy via multi&#8208;level immunity activation and activing the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to reverse tumor hypoxia and impair DNA damage repair. This Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb system effectively enhances the efficiency of radiotherapy to inhibit the progression of irradiated local and abscopal tumors and tumor lung metastases, offering a long&#8208;term memory of antitumor immunity without discernible side effects.

Currently, certain cancer patients exhibit resistance to radiotherapy due to reduced DNA damage under hypoxic conditions and acquired immune tolerance triggered by transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) and membrane&#8208;localized programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1). Meanwhile, cytoplasm&#8208;distributed PD&#8208;L1 induces radiotherapy resistance through accelerating DNA damage repair (DDR). However, the disability of clinically used PD&#8208;L1 antibodies in inhibiting cytoplasm&#8208;distributed PD&#8208;L1 limits their effectiveness. Therefore, a nanoadjuvant is developed to sensitize cancer to radiotherapy via multi&#8208;level immunity activation through depressing PD&#8208;L1 and TGF&#8208;&#946;1 by triphenylphosphine&#8208;derived metformin, and activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by generating Mn2+ from MnO2 and producing more dsDNA via reversing tumor hypoxia and impairing DDR. Thus, Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb effectively enhances the efficiency of radiotherapy to inhibit the progression of irradiated local and abscopal tumors and tumor lung metastases, offering a long&#8208;term memory of antitumor immunity without discernible side effects. Overall, Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb has the potential to be clinically applied for overcoming radio&#8208;immunotherapy resistance.

         <title>An On&#8208;Demand Collaborative Innate&#8211;Adaptive Immune Response to Infection Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrophages play crucial roles in bridging both host innate and adaptive anti&#8208;infectious immunity while their intrinsic bactericidal function is compromised with prolonged infection progressing. After in situ nanoparticle arming, macrophages in infection sites demonstrate substantially augmented antimicrobial activities and also facilitate the reversal of the immunosuppressive microenvironment, which thus realizes infection control and recurrence prevention in an on&#8208;demand manner.








Abstract
Deep tissue infection is a common clinical issue and therapeutic difficulty caused by the disruption of the host antibacterial immune function, resulting in treatment failure and infection relapse. Intracellular pathogens are refractory to elimination and can manipulate host cell biology even after appropriate treatment, resulting in a locoregional immunosuppressive state that leads to an inadequate response to conventional anti&#8208;infective therapies. Here, a novel antibacterial strategy involving autogenous immunity using a biomimetic nanoparticle (NP)&#8208;based regulating system is reported to induce in&#160;situ collaborative innate&#8211;adaptive immune responses. It is observed that a macrophage membrane coating facilitates NP enrichment at the infection site, followed by active NP accumulation in macrophages in a mannose&#8208;dependent manner. These NP&#8208;armed macrophages exhibit considerably improved innate capabilities, including more efficient intracellular ROS generation and pro&#8208;inflammatory factor secretion, M1 phenotype promotion, and effective eradication of invasive bacteria. Furthermore, the reprogrammed macrophages direct T cell activation at infectious sites, resulting in a robust adaptive antimicrobial immune response to ultimately achieve bacterial clearance and prevent infection relapse. Overall, these results provide a conceptual framework for a novel macrophage&#8208;based strategy for infection treatment via the regulation of autogenous immunity.

         <title>Negative Photoconductivity of Fe3GeTe2 Crystal with Native Heterostructure for Ultraviolet to Terahertz Ultra&#8208;Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing negative photoconductivity effect in Fe3GeTe2 9crystal with native heterostructure is first reported. The resulting ferromagnetic&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature photodetector exhibits excellent responsivity of 103&#8211;100&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1 level and ultra&#8208;broadband detection range covering UV&#8211;vis&#8208;IR&#8208;THz band. It surpasses most broad&#8208;spectrum photodetectors and offers the opportunity for Fe3GeTe2 materials in spin optoelectronics with ultra&#8208;low power consumption.








Abstract
Gaining insight into the photoelectric behavior of ferromagnetic materials is significant for comprehensively grasping their intrinsic properties and broadening future application fields. Here, through a specially designed Fe3GeTe2/O&#8208;Fe3GeTe2 heterostructure, first, the broad&#8208;spectrum negative photoconductivity phenomenon of ferromagnetic nodal line semimetal Fe3GeTe2 is reported that covers UV&#8211;vis&#8208;infrared&#8208;terahertz bands (355&#160;nm to 3000&#160;&#181;m), promising to compensate for the inadequacies of traditional optoelectronic devices. The significant suppression of photoexcitation conductivity is revealed to arise from the semimetal/oxidation (sMO) interface&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;response mechanism, in which the electron excitation origins from the semiconductor photoconductivity effect in high&#8208;energy photon region, and semimetal topological band&#8208;transition in low&#8208;energy photon region. High responsivities ranging from 103 to 100&#160;mA W&#8722;1 are acquired within ultraviolet&#8208;terahertz bands under &#177;0.1&#160;V bias voltage at room temperature. Notably, the responsivity of 2.572 A W&#8722;1 at 3000&#160;&#181;m (0.1 THz) and the low noise equivalent power of 26 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 surpass most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mainstream terahertz detectors. This research provides a new perspective for revealing the photoelectric conversion properties of Fe3GeTe2 crystal and paves the way for the development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Enhancement of Perfluorinated Sulfonic Acid Proton Exchange Membrane with Its Own Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High performance perfluorosulfonic acid proton exchange membranes (PEM) &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; with its own nanofibers are prepared, thereby the interfacial compatibility issue of traditional composite materials is perfectly addressed, as a result of orientation of molecular and ion clusters, ultrahigh proton conductivity exceeding 1&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, high strength and low swelling are achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) is crucial for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, a novel &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM is fabricated for the first time, which is composed of perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) resin and its own nanofibers as reinforcement. With this strategy, the interfacial compatibility issue of conventional fiber&#8208;reinforced membranes is fully addressed and up to 80 wt% loading of PFSA nanofibers can be incorporated. Furthermore, on account of chain orientation within the PFSA nanofiber, single fiber exhibits super&#8208;high conductivity of 1.45 S cm&#8722;1, leading to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art proton conductivity (1.1 S cm&#8722;1) of the as&#8208;prepared &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM so far, which is an order of magnitude increase compared with the bulk PFSA membrane (0.29 S cm&#8722;1). It surpasses any commercial PEM including the popular GORE&#8208;SELECT and Nafion HP membranes and is the only PEM with conductivity at 100 S cm&#8722;1 level. In addition, the mechanical strength and swelling ratio of membranes are both substantially improved simultaneously. Based on the high&#8208;performance &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM, high peak power densities of up to 3.6&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and 1.7&#160;W cm&#8722;2 are achieved in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;Air fuel cells, respectively. This strategy can be applied in any polymeric electrolyte membrane.

         <title>Dynamic Behavior of Spatially Confined Sn Clusters and Its Application in Highly Efficient Sodium Storage with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofibers during sodiation and desodiation is revealed. The deep learning&#8208;assisted 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique of CNFs reveals the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters even after desodiation and the remaining pore connectivity despite cluster expansion and solid electrolyte interface formation.








Abstract
Advanced battery electrodes require a cautious design of microscale particles with built&#8208;in nanoscale features to exploit the advantages of both micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles relative to their performance attributes. Herein, the dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofiber) during sodiation and desodiation is revealed using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique. For the first time, the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters after desodiation is observed owing to the aggregation of clusters/single atoms. Pore connectivity is retained despite the anomalous expansion, suggesting inhibition of solid electrolyte interface formation in the sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm pores. Taking advantage of the built&#8208;in nanoconfinement feature, the CNF film with nanometer&#8208;sized interconnected pores hosting Sn clusters (&#8776;2&#160;nm) enables high utilization (95% at a high rate of 1 A g&#8722;1) of Sn active sites while maintaining an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%. The findings provide insights into electrochemical reactions in a confined space and a guiding principle in electrode design for battery applications.

&lt;p&gt;Advanced battery electrodes require a cautious design of microscale particles with built-in nanoscale features to exploit the advantages of both micro- and nano-particles relative to their performance attributes. Herein, the dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofiber) during sodiation and desodiation is revealed using a state-of-the-art 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique. For the first time, the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters after desodiation is observed owing to the aggregation of clusters/single atoms. Pore connectivity is retained despite the anomalous expansion, suggesting inhibition of solid electrolyte interface formation in the sub-2-nm pores. Taking advantage of the built-in nanoconfinement feature, the CNF film with nanometer-sized interconnected pores hosting Sn clusters (&#8776;2&#160;nm) enables high utilization (95% at a high rate of 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of Sn active sites while maintaining an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%.

         <title>Supramolecular Hydrogel with Ultra&#8208;Rapid Cell&#8208;Mediated Network Adaptation for Enhancing Cellular Metabolic Energetics and Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors successfully fabricate an HA&#8208;ADA hydrogel based on CD&#8208;ADA crosslinks. This hydrogel has more dynamic properties, facilitating spreading and cell&#8211;cell interactions of encapsulated cells and promoting fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The enhanced ATP generation promotes human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and further accelerates bone regeneration.









Abstract
Cellular energetics plays an important role in tissue regeneration, and the enhanced metabolic activity of delivered stem cells can accelerate tissue repair and regeneration. However, conventional hydrogels with limited network cell adaptability restrict cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell metabolic activities. In this work, it is shown that a cell&#8208;adaptable hydrogel with high network dynamics enhances the glucose uptake and fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation of encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) compared with a hydrogel with low network dynamics. It is further shown that the hMSCs encapsulated in the high dynamic hydrogels exhibit increased tricarboxylic acid (TCA)&#160;cycle activity, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) biosynthesis via an E&#8208;cadherin&#8208; and AMP&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK)&#8208;dependent mechanism. The in vivo evaluation further showed that the delivery of MSCs by the dynamic hydrogel enhanced in situ bone regeneration in an animal model. It is believed that the findings provide critical insights into the impact of stem cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions on cellular metabolic energetics and the underlying mechanisms.

         <title>Self&#8208;Disassembling and Oxygen&#8208;Generating Porphyrin&#8208;Lipoprotein Nanoparticle for Targeted Glioblastoma Resection and Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Porphyrin lipoprotein&#8208;coated calcium peroxide nanoparticles (PLCNP) help realize the targeted accumulation, enhance porphyrin&#8208;lipid fluorescence, and boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanoplatform enables precise fluorescence&#8208;guided GBM resection and enhances the post&#8208;operative PDT effect via real&#8208;time tumor fluorescence imaging and an ameliorated hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

Abstract
The dismal prognosis for glioblastoma multiform (GBM) patients is primarily attributed to the highly invasive tumor residual that remained after surgical intervention. The development of precise intraoperative imaging and postoperative residual removal techniques will facilitate the gross total elimination of GBM. Here, a self&#8208;disassembling porphyrin lipoprotein&#8208;coated calcium peroxide nanoparticles (PLCNP) is developed to target GBM via macropinocytosis, allowing for fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery of GBM and improving photodynamic treatment (PDT) of GBM residual by alleviating hypoxia. By reducing self&#8208;quenching and enhancing lysosome escape efficiency, the incorporation of calcium peroxide (CaO2) cores in PLCNP amplifies the fluorescence intensity of porphyrin&#8208;lipid. Furthermore, the CaO2 core has diminished tumor hypoxia and improves the PDT efficacy of PLCNP, enabling low&#8208;dose PDT and reversing tumor progression induced by hypoxia aggravation following PDT. Taken together, this self&#8208;disassembling and oxygen&#8208;generating porphyrin&#8208;lipoprotein nanoparticle may serve as a promising all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanotheranostic platform for guiding precise GBM excision and empowering post&#8208;operative PDT, providing a clinically applicable strategy to combat GBM in a safe and effective manner.

Living Chlorella&#8208;loaded poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based microneedles (PILMN&#8208;Chl) are constructed. The PILMN&#8208;Chl combines the continuous and sufficient oxygen supply of Chlorella, the sterilization activities of PIL, and the barrier penetration capabilities of microneedles to effectively accelerate bacteria infected diabetic chronic wounds healing in vivo by topical targeted sterilization and hypoxia relief of the wounds in a two&#8208;pronged manner.








Abstract
Hypoxia and infection are urgent clinical problems in chronic diabetic wounds. Herein, living Chlorella&#8208;loaded poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based microneedles (PILMN&#8208;Chl) are constructed for microacupuncture oxygen and antibacterial therapy against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected chronic diabetic wounds. The PILMN&#8208;Chl can stably and continuously produce oxygen for more than 30&#160;h due to the photosynthesis of the loaded self&#8208;supported Chlorella. By combining the barrier penetration capabilities of microneedles, the continuous and sufficient oxygen supply of Chlorella, and the sterilization activities of PIL, the PILMN&#8208;Chl can accelerate chronic diabetic wounds in vivo by topical targeted sterilization and hypoxia relief in deep parts of wounds. Thus, the self&#8208;oxygen produced microneedles modality may provide a promising and facile therapeutic strategy for treating chronic, hypoxic, and infected diabetic wounds.

         <title>Sr4Al2O7: A New Sacrificial Layer with High Water Dissolution Rate for the Synthesis of Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sacrificial layer, Sr4Al2O7, is proposed to fabricate freestanding oxide membranes with high water dissolution rate, which is &#8776;10 times higher than that of Sr3Al2O6. The high&#8208;dissolution&#8208;rate of Sr4Al2O7 is most likely attributed to the more discrete Al&#8208;O networks and higher concentration of water&#8208;soluble Sr&#8208;O species in its crystal structure.








Abstract
Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes have drawn great attention recently since they offer exceptional structural tunability and stacking ability, providing new opportunities in fundamental research and potential device applications in silicon&#8208;based semiconductor technology. Among different types of sacrificial layers, the (Ca, Sr, Ba)3Al2O6 compounds are most widely used since they can be dissolved in water and prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite oxide membranes with clean and sharp surfaces and interfaces; However, the typical transfer process takes a long time (up to hours) in obtaining millimeter&#8208;size freestanding membranes, let alone realize wafer&#8208;scale samples with high yield. Here, a new member of the SrO&#8208;Al2O3 family, Sr4Al2O7 is introduced, and its high dissolution rate, &#8776;10 times higher than that of Sr3Al2O6 is demonstrated. The high&#8208;dissolution&#8208;rate of Sr4Al2O7 is most likely related to the more discrete Al&#8208;O networks and higher concentration of water&#8208;soluble Sr&#8208;O species in this compound. This work significantly facilitates the preparation of freestanding membranes and sheds light on the integration of multifunctional perovskite oxides in practical electronic devices.

The high-dissolution-rate of Sr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is most likely attributed to the more discrete Al-O networks and higher concentration of water-soluble Sr-O species in its crystal structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes have drawn great attention recently since they offer exceptional structural tunability and stacking ability, providing new opportunities in fundamental research and potential device applications in silicon-based semiconductor technology. Among different types of sacrificial layers, the (Ca, Sr, Ba)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compounds are most widely used since they can be dissolved in water and prepare high-quality perovskite oxide membranes with clean and sharp surfaces and interfaces; However, the typical transfer process takes a long time (up to hours) in obtaining millimeter-size freestanding membranes, let alone realize wafer-scale samples with high yield. Here, a new member of the SrO-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; family, Sr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is introduced, and its high dissolution rate, &#8776;10 times higher than that of Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated. The high-dissolution-rate of Sr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is most likely related to the more discrete Al-O networks and higher concentration of water-soluble Sr-O species in this compound. This work significantly facilitates the preparation of freestanding membranes and sheds light on the integration of multifunctional perovskite oxides in practical electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin, Transferred Layers of Silicon Oxynitrides as Tunable Biofluid Barriers for Bioresorbable Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a class of inorganic material (silicon oxynitride) that can be formed in thin films as stable barriers to surrounding ground water or biofluids, yet ultimately dissolve completely to biologically and environmentally benign end products. These ultrathin, transferred inorganic layers enable the stable operation of partially biodegradable wireless light&#8208;emitting diodes over extended periods in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Bio/ecoresorbable electronic systems create unique opportunities in implantable medical devices that serve a need over a finite time period and then disappear naturally to eliminate the need for extraction surgeries. A critical challenge in the development of this type of technology is in materials that can serve as thin, stable barriers to surrounding ground water or biofluids, yet ultimately dissolve completely to benign end products. This paper describes a class of inorganic material (silicon oxynitride, SiON) that can be formed in thin films by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition for this purpose. In vitro studies suggest that SiON and its dissolution products are biocompatible, indicating the potential for its use in implantable devices. A facile process to fabricate flexible, wafer&#8208;scale multilayer films bypasses limitations associated with the mechanical fragility of inorganic thin films. Systematic computational, analytical, and experimental studies highlight the essential materials aspects. Demonstrations in wireless light&#8208;emitting diodes both in vitro and in vivo illustrate the practical use of these materials strategies. The ability to select degradation rates and water permeability through fine tuning of chemical compositions and thicknesses provides the opportunity to obtain a range of functional lifetimes to meet different application requirements.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Flexible and High&#8208;Performing Thermoelectrics by Direct Laser Printing on Plastic Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalistic route to additively manufacture, via laser printing, ultra&#8208;flexible and high&#8208;performing Bi2Te3 films (power factor over 1500 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2) directly on plastic foil is developed. This route facilitates large&#8208;area fabrication and complex maskless patterning without organic binders and leads to the innovative concept of &#8220;cuttable power arrays&#8221; that enable the fast customization of thermoelectric generators for diverse applications.








Abstract
The emerging fields of wearables and the Internet of Things introduce the need for electronics and power sources with unconventional form factors: large area, customizable shape, and flexibility. Thermoelectric (TE) generators can power those systems by converting abundant waste heat into electricity, whereas the versatility of additive manufacturing suits heterogeneous form factors. Here, additive manufacturing of high&#8208;performing flexible TEs is proposed. Maskless and large&#8208;area patterning of Bi2Te3&#8208;based films is performed by laser powder bed fusion directly on plastic foil. Mechanical interlocking allows simultaneous patterning, sintering, and attachment of the films to the substrate without using organic binders that jeopardize the final performance. Material waste could be minimized by recycling the unexposed powder. The particular microstructure of the laser&#8208;printed material renders the&#8212;otherwise brittle&#8212;Bi2Te3 films highly flexible despite their high thickness. The films survive 500 extreme&#8208;bending cycles to a 0.76&#160;mm radius. Power factors above 1500 &#181;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;2 and a record&#8208;low sheet resistance for flexible TEs of 0.4 &#937; sq&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to unprecedented potential for power generation. This versatile fabrication route enables innovative implementations, such as cuttable arrays adapting to specific applications in&#160;self&#8208;powered sensing, and energy harvesting from unusual scenarios like human skin and curved hot surfaces.

         <title>Self&#8208;Heating Multistage Microneedle Patch for Topical Therapy of Skin Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a self&#8208;heating multistage microneedle patch is reported. It presents a multilevel structure including a dissolvable base for rapid drug release (5&#8208;FU/HA), a degradable tip for sustained drug release (thymoquinone/Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)), and a substrate filled with self&#8208;heating material (Fe power mixture). Such self&#8208;heating microneedle patch is very promising for the high&#8208;efficient topical therapy of skin cancer.








Abstract
Topical therapy is a favored route for treating skin cancers, but remain many challenges, such as low delivery efficiency, limited tumor tissue penetration, and unsatisfactory blood circulation. Here, a self&#8208;heating microneedle (MN) patch with multilevel structures, including a dissolvable base for rapid drug release, a degradable tip for sustained drug release, and a self&#8208;heating substrate is described. The thermally enhanced drug release performance is validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. High tumor therapeutic efficacy can be achieved due to the rapid release of 5&#8208;fluorouracil, while the sustained release of thymoquinone endows the MN patch with long&#8208;term tumor inhibition ability. It is further demonstrated the feasibility of such an MN patch for in vivo topical therapy of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with high efficacy, low side effects, and long&#8208;term inhibition of recurrence. This self&#8208;heating MN patch holds great promise for potential clinical applications, especially for the treatment of skin cancers.

         <title>Observation of Topological Hall Effect in a Chemically Complex Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pronounced topological Hall effect (up to 1.92 &#181;&#937; cm) is observed in a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Mn chemically complex alloy film across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. Distinct from that observed in the skyrmion systems and geometrically frustrated magnets, this effect is attributed to the nonvanishing spin chirality created by spin frustration under the magnetic field.








Abstract
The topological Hall effect (THE) is the transport response of chiral spin textures and thus can serve as a powerful probe for detecting and understanding these unconventional magnetic orders. So far, the THE is only observed in either noncentrosymmetric systems where spin chirality is stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions, or triangular&#8208;lattice magnets with Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida&#8208;type interactions. Here, a pronounced THE is observed in a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Mn chemically complex alloy with a simple face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. The alloy is shown to have a strong magnetic frustration owing to the random occupation of magnetic atoms on the close&#8208;packed fcc lattice and the direct Heisenberg exchange interaction among atoms, as evidenced by the appearance of a reentrant spin glass state in the low&#8208;temperature regime and the first principles calculations. Consequently, THE is attributed to the nonvanishing spin chirality created by strong spin frustration under the external magnetic field, which is distinct from the mechanism responsible for the skyrmion systems, as well as geometrically frustrated magnets.

         <title>Injectable Self&#8208;Expanding/Self&#8208;Propelling Hydrogel Adhesive with Procoagulant Activity and Rapid Gelation for Lethal Massive Hemorrhage Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injectable antibacterial hydrogels with self&#8208;expanding/self&#8208;propelling, wet tissue adhesiveness, procoagulant activity, and rapid gelation are prepared based on CO2 foaming and Schiff base crosslinking. Due to the combination of efficient coagulation, plugging of bleeding site, and tissue adhesiveness, the hydrogel is effective in stopping fatal massive and/or noncompressible hemorrhages on wet tissue surfaces, at the extremity junctions and at the torso.








Abstract
Developing hydrogels that can quickly reach deep bleeding sites, adhere to wounds, and expand to stop lethal and/or noncompressible bleeding in civil and battlefield environments remains a challenge. Herein, an injectable, antibacterial, self&#8208;expanding, and self&#8208;propelling hydrogel bioadhesive with procoagulant activity and rapid gelation is reported. This hydrogel combines spontaneous gas foaming and rapid Schiff base crosslinking for lethal massive hemorrhage. Hydrogels have rapid gelation and expansion rate, high self&#8208;expanding ratio, excellent antibacterial activity, antioxidant efficiency, and tissue adhesion capacity. In addition, hydrogels have good cytocompatibility, procoagulant ability, and higher blood cell/platelet adhesion activity than commercial combat gauze and gelatin sponge. The optimized hydrogel (OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30) exhibits better hemostatic ability than combat gauze and gelatin sponge in rat liver and femoral artery bleeding models, rabbit volumetric liver loss massive bleeding models with/without anticoagulant, and rabbit liver and kidney incision bleeding models with bleeding site not visible. Especially, OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30 rapidly stops the bleedings from pelvic area of rabbit, and swine subclavian artery vein transection. Furthermore, OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30 has biodegradability and biocompatibility, and accelerates Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected skin wound healing. This injectable, antibacterial, self&#8208;expanding, and self&#8208;propelling hydrogel opens up a new avenue to develop hemostats for lethal massive bleeding, abdominal organ bleeding, and bleeding from coagulation lesions.

         <title>Highly Ordered Eutectic Mesostructures via Template&#8208;Directed Solidification within Thermally Engineered Templates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Template thermal engineering greatly enhances long&#8208;range order of mesostructures formed by template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly. Employing porous Si rods as a template (thermal conductivity &#8776;0.28 Wm&#8208;1K&#8208;1, thermal diffusivity &#8776;0.89 mm2/s) nearly perfect periodic microstructures with optical properties matching simulations result. In distinct contrast, when the thermal diffusivity of the template is much greater, only disordered structures are formed.








Abstract
Template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of solidifying eutectics results in emergence of unique microstructures due to diffusion constraints and thermal gradients imposed by the template. Here, the importance of selecting the template material based on its conductivity to control heat transfer between the template and the solidifying eutectic, and thus the thermal gradients near the solidification front, is demonstrated. Simulations elucidate the relationship between the thermal properties of the eutectic and template and the resultant microstructure. The overarching finding is that templates with low thermal conductivities are generally advantageous for forming highly organized microstructures. When electrochemically porosified silicon pillars (thermal conductivity &lt; 0.3 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) are used as the template into which an AgCl&#8208;KCl eutectic is solidified, 99% of the unit cells in the solidified structure exhibit the same pattern. In contrast, when higher thermal conductivity crystalline silicon pillars (&#8776;100 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) are utilized, the expected pattern is only present in 50% of the unit cells. The thermally engineered template results in mesostructures with tunable optical properties and reflectances nearly identical to the simulated reflectances of perfect structures, indicating highly ordered patterns are formed over large areas. This work highlights the importance of controlling heat flows in template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of eutectics.

         <title>Rapid Generation of hPSC&#8208;Derived High Endothelial Venule Organoids with In Vivo Ectopic Lymphoid Tissue Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods to control, enhance, or restrain the immune reactivity of T cells are desirable for immune disorders and anti&#8208;tumor therapies. This study presents a fast method for the generation of synthetic lymph nodes (named HEVOs) from human pluripotent stem cells, which can be implanted to control the activity of T cells locally, for example, against tumors.








Abstract
Bioengineering strategies for the fabrication of implantable lymphoid structures mimicking lymph nodes (LNs) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) could amplify the adaptive immune response for therapeutic applications such as cancer immunotherapy. No method to date has resulted in the consistent formation of high endothelial venules (HEVs), which is the specialized vasculature responsible for na&#239;ve T cell recruitment and education in both LNs and TLS. Here orthogonal induced differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells carrying a regulatable ETV2 allele is used to rapidly and efficiently induce endothelial differentiation. Assembly of embryoid bodies combining primitive inducible endothelial cells and primary human LN fibroblastic reticular cells results in the formation of HEV&#8208;like structures that can aggregate into 3D organoids (HEVOs). Upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice, HEVOs successfully engraft and form lymphatic structures that recruit both antigen&#8208;presenting cells and adoptively&#8208;transferred lymphocytes, therefore displaying basic TLS capabilities. The results further show that functionally, HEVOs can organize an immune response and promote anti&#8208;tumor activity by adoptively&#8208;transferred T lymphocytes. Collectively, the experimental approaches represent an innovative and scalable proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy for the fabrication of bioengineered TLS that can be deployed in vivo to enhance adaptive immune responses.

         <title>Validating Operating Stability and Biocompatibility Toward Safer&#160;Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PAM hydrogel electrolyte with slippage&#8208;free electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface and superior moisture maintaining ability is designed to ensure the operating stability of biocompatible zinc&#8208;based batteries. The impacts from batteries on body are evaluated with human cell lines and battery implantations, which demonstrate the high biosecurity.








Abstract
Wearable and implantable electronics are standing at the frontiers of science and technology, driven by the increasing demands from modernized lifestyles. Zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) are regarded as ideal energy suppliers for these biocompatible electronics, but the corresponding biocompatibility validation is still in the initial stage. Meanwhile, complicated working conditions and some extreme electrolyte environments raise strict challenges, leaving less choices for safe ZBs. Toward higher operating stability and biocompatibility, this work proposes a hydrogel electrolyte featuring the moisture maintaining ability and a robust interface, which could further provide a milder environment for Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries and Zn&#8208;air batteries. The cytotoxicity and tissue injury of batteries are evaluated with human cell lines and battery implantations on the animal models, which demonstrate the high biocompatibility&#160;of ZBs, while preliminary wearable devices implementation further verifies their operating stability. This work may provide a pathway for developing and validating biocompatible ZBs, contributing to their future practical employment in relevant fields.

         <dc:description>
A meticulous and extensive bibliometric analysis of nanomedicine publications over a 23&#8208;year period (2000&#8208;2023) is presented. This study covers publication trends, research powers, keywords, references, subject classifications, research themes, and journals. This investigation reveals the field's evolution, current state, frontiers, and emerging trends. Valuable insights will inspire researchers in diverse industries, enriching their refined comprehension of nanomedicine research.








Abstract
Nanotechnology profoundly affects the advancement of medicine. Limitations in diagnosing and treating cancer and chronic diseases promote the growth of nanomedicine. However, there are very few analytical and descriptive studies regarding the trajectory of nanomedicine, key research powers, present research landscape, focal investigative points, and future outlooks. Herein, articles and reviews published in the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection from first January 2000 to 18th July 2023 are analyzed. Herein, a bibliometric visualization of publication trends, countries/regions, institutions, journals, research categories, themes, references, and keywords is produced and elaborated. Nanomedicine&#8208;related academic output is increasing since the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, solidifying the uneven global distribution of research performance. While China leads in terms of publication quantity and has numerous highly productive institutions, the USA has advantages in academic impact, commercialization, and industrial value. Nanomedicine integrates with other disciplines, establishing interdisciplinary platforms, in which drug delivery and nanoparticles remain focal points. Current research focuses on integrating nanomedicine and cell ferroptosis induction in cancer immunotherapy. The keyword &#8220;burst testing&#8221; identifies promising research directions, including immunogenic cell death, chemodynamic therapy, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, and extracellular vesicles. The prospects, major challenges, and barriers to addressing these directions are discussed.

         <title>Tunable Adhesion for All&#8208;Dry Transfer of 2D Materials Enabled by the Freezing of Transfer Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, by freezing the transfer medium to induce the crosslinking of polymer chains, the adhesion is successfully tuned between graphene and polymer for wafer&#8208;scale all&#8208;dry of graphene and MoS2 onto various substrates, compatible with industrial production for future applications.








Abstract
The real applications of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown graphene films require the reliable techniques for transferring graphene from growth substrates onto application&#8208;specific substrates. The transfer approaches that avoid the use of organic solvents, etchants, and strong bases are compatible with industrial batch processing, in which graphene transfer should be conducted by dry exfoliation and lamination. However, all&#8208;dry transfer of graphene remains unachievable owing to the difficulty in precisely controlling interfacial adhesion to enable the crack&#8208; and contamination&#8208;free transfer. Herein, through controllable crosslinking of transfer medium polymer, the adhesion is successfully tuned between the polymer and graphene for all&#8208;dry transfer of graphene wafers. Stronger adhesion enables crack&#8208;free peeling of the graphene from growth substrates, while reduced adhesion facilitates the exfoliation of polymer from graphene surface leaving an ultraclean surface. This work provides an industrially compatible approach for transferring 2D materials, key for their future applications, and offers a route for tuning the interfacial adhesion that would allow for the transfer&#8208;enabled fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Tunable 2D Electron&#8208; and 2D Hole States Observed at Fe/SrTiO3 Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to tuning the carrier character of a Fe/SrTiO3 interface is the oxidation state of the Fe overlayer. For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty bandgap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti&#8208; and Fe&#8208;derived states across the interface, while for Fe3O4 overlayers, a 2D electron system is formed.








Abstract
Oxide electronics provide the key concepts and materials for enhancing silicon&#8208;based semiconductor technologies with novel functionalities. However, a basic but key property of semiconductor devices still needs to be unveiled in its oxidic counterparts: the ability to set or even switch between two types of carriers&#8212;either negatively (n) charged electrons or positively (p) charged holes. Here, direct evidence for individually emerging n&#8208; or p&#8208;type 2D band dispersions in STO&#8208;based heterostructures is provided using resonant photoelectron spectroscopy. The key to tuning the carrier character is the oxidation state of an adjacent Fe&#8208;based interface layer: For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty bandgap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti&#8208; and Fe&#8208; derived states across the interface, while for Fe3O4 overlayers, an 2D electron system is formed. Unexpected oxygen vacancy characteristics arise for the hole&#8208;type interfaces, which as of yet had&#160;been exclusively assigned to the emergence of 2DESs. In general, this finding opens up the possibility to straightforwardly switch the type of conductivity at STO interfaces by the oxidation state of a redox overlayer. This will extend the spectrum of phenomena in oxide electronics, including the realization of combined n/p&#8208;type all&#8208;oxide transistors or logic&#160;gates.

         <title>Fast Kinetics Design for Solid&#8208;State Battery Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leap of full cell kinetics at high cathode loading and areal capacity is achieved by designing a hierarchical structure of electrode composites. The design enables high areal capacities above 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 to be stably cycled at &#8776;13&#8211;40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and with a C&#8208;rate from 5 to 10 C.








Abstract
Fast kinetics of solid&#8208;state batteries at the device level is not adequately explored to achieve fast charging and discharging. In this work, a leap forward is achieved for fast kinetics in full cells with high cathode loading and areal capacity. This kinetic improvement is achieved by designing a hierarchical structure of electrode composites. In the cathode, the authors&#8217; design enables high areal capacities above 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 to be stably cycled at high current densities of &#8776;13&#8211;40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, yielding a C&#8208;rate from 5 to 10 C. In the anode, the authors&#8217; design breaks the common rule of the negative correlation between critical C&#8208;rate and the discharge voltage that is observed in most other anodes. The overall design enables the fast cycling of such batteries for over 4000 cycles at room temperature and 5 C charge&#8208;rate. The design principles unveiled by this work help to understand critical kinetic processes in battery devices that limit the fast cycling at high cathode loading and speed up the design of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Constructing Ultra&#8208;Shallow Near&#8208;Edge States for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient doping of hybrid perovskites holds the potential to further advance solar cell efficiency. This study presents a generic strategy for perovskite doping by constructing ultra&#8208;shallow near&#8208;edge states. These states can effectively prolong electron&#8208;hole recombination through efficient trap and de&#8208;trap processes, resulting in over 25% efficiency in inverted perovskite solar cells with superior long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Electronic band structure engineering of metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHP) lies at the core of fundamental materials research and photovoltaic applications. However, reconfiguring the band structures in MHP for optimized electronic properties remains challenging. This article reports a generic strategy for constructing near&#8208;edge states to improve carrier properties, leading to enhanced device performances. The near&#8208;edge states are designed around the valence band edge using theoretical prediction and constructed through tailored material engineering. These states are experimentally revealed with activation energies of around 23 milli&#8208;electron volts by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Such small activation energies enable prolonged carrier lifetime with efficient carrier transition dynamics and low non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, as corroborated by the millisecond lifetimes of microwave conductivity. By constructing near&#8208;edge states in positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative inverted cells, a champion efficiency of 25.4% (25.0% certified) for a 0.07&#8208;cm2 cell and 23.6% (22.7% certified) for a 1&#8208;cm2 cell is achieved. The most stable encapsulated cell retains 90% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) at 65 &#176;C in ambient air.

The near-edge states are designed around the valence band edge using theoretical prediction and constructed through tailored material engineering. These states are experimentally revealed with activation energies of around 23 milli-electron volts by temperature-dependent time-resolved spectroscopy. Such small activation energies enable prolonged carrier lifetime with efficient carrier transition dynamics and low non-radiative recombination losses, as corroborated by the millisecond lifetimes of microwave conductivity. By constructing near-edge states in positive-intrinsic-negative inverted cells, a champion efficiency of 25.4% (25.0% certified) for a 0.07-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cell and 23.6% (22.7% certified) for a 1-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cell is achieved. The most stable encapsulated cell retains 90% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 65 &#176;C in ambient air.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A DNA/Upconversion Nanoparticle Complex Enables Controlled Co&#8208;Delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 and Photodynamic Agents for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional DNA/upconversion nanoparticle complex is constructed, which enables the controlled co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, hemin, and protoporphyrin for synergistic photodynamic therapy (PDT) activated by near&#8208;infrared light. The integrated functions of gene editing and PDT allow the substantial accumulation of 1O2 in cancer cells for enhanced cell apoptosis, and this synergistic PDT has shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in a breast cancer mouse model.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the light&#8208;irradiated exciting of photosensitizer (PS) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which faces challenges and limitations in hypoxia and antioxidant response of cancer cells, and limited tissue&#8208;penetration of light. Herein, a multifunctional DNA/upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) complex is developed which enables controlled co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, hemin, and protoporphyrin (PP) for synergistic PDT. An ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) is prepared via rolling circle amplification (RCA), which contains recognition sequences of single guide RNA (sgRNA) for loading Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), G&#8208;quadruplex sequences for loading hemin and PP, and linker sequences for combining UCNP. Cas9 RNP cleaves the antioxidant regulator nuclear factor E2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2), improving the sensitivity of cancer cells to ROS, and enhancing the synergistic PDT effect. The G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme mimicks horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to catalyze the endogenous H2O2 to O2, overcoming hypoxia condition in tumors. The introduced UCNP converts NIR irradiation with deep tissue penetration to light with shorter wavelength, exciting PP to transform the abundant O2 to 1O2. The integration of gene editing and PDT allows substantial accumulation of 1O2 in cancer cells for enhanced cell apoptosis, and this synergistic PDT has shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in a breast cancer mouse model.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Ionic Conductors with Tunable Resistance Switching Temperature Enabled by Phase Transformation of Polymer Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel phase&#8208;transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) with tunable resistance switching temperature are designed by polymer cocrystal phase. These obtained PTICs have ultrahigh temperature sensitivity in the resistance switching region and can detect tiny temperature variation, allowing for the intelligent applications for overheating warning and heat dissipation.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) show significant prospects for functional applications due to their reversible resistance switching property. However, the representative design principle of PTICs is utilizing the melt&#8208;crystallization transition of ionic liquids, and the resistance switching temperatures of such PTICs cannot be tuned as desired. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to design PTICs with on&#8208;demand resistance switching temperatures by using the melt&#8208;crystallization transition of polymer cocrystal phase, whose melting temperature shows a linear relationship with the polymer compositions. Owing to the melt of polymer cocrystal domains and the tunable migration of ions in the resistance switching region, the obtained PTICs display ultrahigh temperature sensitivity with a superior temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8722;8.50% &#176;C&#8722;1 around human body temperature, as compared to various ionic conductors previously reported. Therefore, the PTICs can detect tiny temperature variation, allowing for the intelligent applications for overheating warning and heat dissipation. It is believed that this work may inspire future researches on the development of advanced soft electrical devices.

         <title>Synergistic Chemoimmunotherapy Augmentation via Sequential Nanocomposite Hydrogel&#8208;Mediated Reprogramming of Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts in Osteosarcoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential nanocomposite hydrogel reshaping cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast (CAF) behavior is developed, fostering tumor&#8208;infiltrating T&#8208;cells in osteosarcoma. The injectable hydrogel based on carboxymethyl chitosan/ tetrabasic polyethylene glycol regulates the release of a potent CAF suppressor (Nox4 inhibitor) and liposomal Doxorubicin. Combining the gel with a checkpoint inhibitor boosts anti&#8208;tumor immunity in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model.








Abstract
In osteosarcoma, immunotherapy often faces hurdles posed by cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete dense extracellular matrix components and cytokines. Directly removing CAFs may prove ineffective and even promote tumor metastasis. To address this challenge, a sequential nanocomposite hydrogel that reshapes CAF behavior is developed, enhancing tumor&#8208;infiltrating T&#8208;cells in osteosarcoma. The approach utilizes an injectable blend of carboxymethyl chitosan and tetrabasic polyethylene glycol, forming a hydrogel for controlled release of a potent CAF suppressor (Nox4 inhibitor, Nox4i) and liposomal Doxorubicin (L&#8208;Dox) to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) upon in situ administration. Nox4i effectively counters CAF activation, overcoming T&#8208;cell exclusion mechanisms, followed by programmed L&#8208;Dox release for ICD induction in stroma&#8208;rich osteosarcoma models. Combining the co&#8208;delivery gel with &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint inhibitor further enhances its effectiveness in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model. Immunophenotyping data underscore a significant boost in tumor T&#8208;cell infiltration and favorable anti&#8208;tumor immunity at the whole&#8208;animal level.

         <title>3D Tiled Auxetic Metamaterial: A New Family of Mechanical Metamaterial with High Resilience and Mechanical Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create novel mechanical metamaterial via 3D space filling tiles with engaging key&#8208;channel pairs is demonstrated via new 3D printed auxetic 3D keyed&#8208;octahedron&#8211;cuboctahedron metamaterials. The new designs show auxeticity, high resilience, large mechanical hysteresis, ideal isotropy, and a unique coupled auxeticity and twisting behavior, as rarely seen in existing 3D mechanical metamaterials.








Abstract
For artificial materials, desired properties often conflict. For example, engineering materials often achieve high energy dissipation by sacrificing resilience and vice versa, or desired auxeticity by losing their isotropy, which limits their performance and applications. To solve these conflicts, a strategy is proposed to create novel mechanical metamaterial via 3D space filling tiles with engaging key&#8208;channel pairs, exemplified via auxetic 3D keyed&#8208;octahedron&#8211;cuboctahedron metamaterials. This metamaterial shows high resilience while achieving large mechanical hysteresis synergistically under large compressive strain. Especially, this metamaterial exhibits ideal isotropy approaching the theoretical limit of isotropic Poisson's ratio, &#8208;1, as rarely seen in existing 3D mechanical metamaterials. In addition, the new class of metamaterials provides wide tunability on mechanical properties and behaviors, including an unusual coupled auxeticity and twisting behavior under normal compression. The designing methodology is illustrated by the integral of numerical modeling, theoretical analysis, and experimental characterization. The new mechanical metamaterials have broad applications in actuators and dampers, soft robotics, biomedical materials, and engineering materials/systems for energy dissipation.

This study prepares FeN4P2 single&#8208;atom nanozymes (FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes) with low&#8208;temperature adaptive OXD&#8208;like activity at cold chain temperatures (4, and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), which efficiently inactivate multiple enveloped viruses by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope; Additionally, under conditions of cold chain logistics, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes are successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer packaging and personal protective equipment.








Abstract
Outbreaks of viral infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) and influenza A virus (IAV), pose a great threat to human health. Viral spread is accelerated worldwide by the development of cold chain logistics; Therefore, an effective antiviral approach is required. In this study, it is aimed to develop a distinct antiviral strategy using nanozymes with low&#8208;temperature adaptability, suitable for cold chain logistics. Phosphorus (P) atoms are added to the remote counter position of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C center to prepare FeN4P2&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), exhibiting lipid oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like activity at cold chain temperatures (&#8722;20, and 4&#160;&#176;C). This feature enables FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes to disrupt multiple enveloped viruses (human, swine, and avian coronaviruses, and H1&#8208;H11 subtypes of IAV) by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope. Under the simulated conditions of cold chain logistics, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes are successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer packaging and personal protective equipment; Therefore, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes with low&#8208;temperature adaptability and broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral properties may serve as key materials for developing specific antiviral approaches to interrupt viral transmission through the cold chain.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic and Photovoltaic Performance Arising from Unconventionally Low Donor&#8211;Y6 Ratios</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the use of unconventionally low donor:acceptor ratios of PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 blends for enhanced photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance. Inclusion of the donor in nanoparticle suspensions or solid&#8208;state films at low donor mass ratios provide a novel method of reducing the rate of charge recombination in Y6, leading to high performance.








Abstract
Development of both organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic photocatalysts has focused on utilizing the bulk heterojunction (BHJ). The BHJ promotes charge separation and enhances the carrier lifetime, but may give rise to increased charge traps, hindering performance. Here, high photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance is displayed by electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) nanoparticles (NPs) and films, using the nonfullerene acceptor Y6 and polymer donor PIDT&#8208;T8BT. In contrast to conventional D&#8211;A systems, the charge generation in PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 NPs is mainly driven by Y6, allowing a high performance even at a low D:A mass ratio of 1:50. The high performance at the low mass ratio is attributed to the amorphous behavior of PIDT&#8208;T8BT. Low ratios are generally thought to yield lower efficiency than the more conventional &#8776;1:1 ratio. However, the OPVs exhibit peak performance at a D:A ratio of 1:5. Similarly the NPs used for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution show peak performance at the 1:6.7 D:A ratio. Interestingly, for the PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 system, as the polymer proportion increases, a reduced photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance is observed. The unconventional D:A ratios provide lower recombination losses and increased charge&#8208;carrier lifetime with undisrupted ambipolar charge transport in bulk Y6, enabling better performance than conventional ratios. This work reports novel light&#8208;harvesting materials in which performance is reduced due to unfavorable morphology as D:A ratios move toward conventional ratios of 1:1.2&#8211;1:1.

         <title>Chemical Rules for Stacked Kagome and Honeycomb Topological Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing tight&#8208;binding model and high&#8208;throughput calculation, the chemical rules governing topological states have been studied in stacked kagome and honeycomb lattices.Calculation results reveal that the IAMX family materials are topological nodal&#8208;line semimetals categorized into four groups, and change into Weyl semimetals with spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The detailed chemical rule analysis paves a way to study the rich topological states in kagome materials.








Abstract
The chemical rules for predicting and understanding topological states in stacked kagome and honeycomb lattices are studied in both analytical and numerical ways. Starting with a minimal five&#8208;band tight&#8208;binding model, all the topological states are sorted into five groups, which are determined by the interlayer and intralayer hopping parameters. Combined with the model, an algorithm is designed to obtain a series of experimentally synthesized topological semimetals with kagome and honeycomb layers, i.e., IAMX family (IA = Alkali metal element, M = Rare earth metal element, X = Carbon group element), in the inorganic crystal structure database. A follow&#8208;up high&#8208;throughput calculation shows that IAMX family materials are all nodal&#8208;line semimetals and they will be Weyl semimetals after taking spin&#8208;orbit coupling into consideration. To have further insights into the topology of the IAMX family, a detailed chemical rule analysis is carried out on the high&#8208;throughput calculations, including the lattice constants of the structure, intralayer and interlayer couplings, bond strengths, electronegativity, and so on, which are consistent with the tight&#8208;binding model. This study provides a way to discover and modulate topological properties in stacked kagome and honeycomb crystals and offers candidates for studying topology&#8208;related properties like topological superconductors and axion&#160;insulators.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Scaffold&#8208;Assisted Tumor Vaccines Induce Tumor Regression and Long&#8208;Term Immune Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injectable decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds enhance the efficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines using tumor protein antigen and an immune&#8208;stimulating STING agonist. ECM scaffolds prolong antigen release and recruit antigen&#8208;presenting cells to help generate heightened cytotoxic T cell responses leading to effective tumor killing.








Abstract
Injectable scaffold delivery is a strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccine immunotherapy. The choice of scaffold biomaterial is crucial, impacting both vaccine release kinetics and immune stimulation via the host response. Extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds prepared from decellularized tissues facilitate a pro&#8208;healing inflammatory response that promotes local cancer immune surveillance. Here, an ECM scaffold&#8208;assisted therapeutic cancer vaccine that maintains an immune microenvironment consistent with tissue reconstruction is engineered. Several immune&#8208;stimulating adjuvants are screened to develop a cancer vaccine formulated with decellularized small intestinal submucosa (SIS) ECM scaffold co&#8208;delivery. It is found that the STING pathway agonist cyclic di&#8208;AMP most effectively induces cytotoxic immunity in an ECM scaffold vaccine, without compromising key interleukin 4 (IL&#8208;4) mediated immune pathways associated with healing. ECM scaffold delivery enhances therapeutic vaccine efficacy, curing 50&#8211;75% of established E.G&#8208;7OVA lymphoma tumors in mice, while none are cured with soluble vaccine. SIS&#8208;ECM scaffold&#8208;assisted vaccination prolonged antigen exposure is dependent on CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and generates long&#8208;term antigen&#8208;specific immune memory for at least 10 months post&#8208;vaccination. This study shows that an ECM scaffold is a promising delivery vehicle to enhance cancer vaccine efficacy while being orthogonal to characteristics of pro&#8208;healing immune hallmarks.

         <title>Ultraflexible Wireless Imager Integrated with Organic Circuits for Broadband Infrared Thermal Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultraflexible imager incorporating carbon nanotube photodetectors and organic circuits is developed for infrared imaging. This imager, which employs an 8 &#215; 8 active&#8208;sensor matrix, exhibits high sensitivity to broadband infrared light. The functionality of the imaging system is verified through its application in thermal imaging, confirming that it facilitates the analysis of heat sources, biological movements, and in&#8208;liquid glucose.








Abstract
Flexible imagers are currently under intensive development as versatile optical sensor arrays, designed to capture images of surfaces and internals, irrespective of their shape. A significant challenge in developing flexible imagers is extending their detection capabilities to encompass a broad spectrum of infrared light, particularly terahertz (THz) light at room temperature. This advancement is crucial for thermal and biochemical applications. In this study, a flexible infrared imager is designed using uncooled carbon nanotube (CNT) sensors and organic circuits. The CNT sensors, fabricated on ultrathin 2.4&#160;&#181;m substrates, demonstrate enhanced sensitivity across a wide infrared range, spanning from near&#8208;infrared to THz wavelengths. Moreover, they retain their characteristics under bending and crumpling. The design incorporates light&#8208;shielded organic transistors and circuits, functioning reliably under light irradiation, and amplifies THz detection signals by a factor of 10. The integration of both CNT sensors and shielded organic transistors into an 8 &#215; 8 active&#8208;sensor matrix within the imager enables sequential infrared imaging and nondestructive assessment for heat sources and in&#8208;liquid chemicals through wireless communication systems. The proposed imager, offering unique functionality, shows promise for applications in biochemical analysis and soft robotics.

         <title>Bright Circularly Polarized Mechanoluminescence from 0D Hybrid Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized mechanoluminescence (CPML) emissions are achieved in 0D chiral Mn&#8208;based hybrid manganese halides with large conjugate ligands. These compounds exhibit highly bright and sensitive green CPML emissions with an extraordinary antithermal quenching effect, and then are demonstrated as chiral stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in multilevel confidential information encryption.








Abstract
Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have application prospects in many fields, due to their abundant host&#8211;guest structures and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). However, CPLs in HMHs are predominantly excited by light or electricity, limiting their use in multivariate environments. It is necessary to explore a novel excitation method to extend the application of chiral HMHs as smart stimuli&#8208;responsive optical materials. In this work, an enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid manganese bromides, [H2(2R,4R)&#8208;(+)/(2S,4S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;2,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane]MnBr4 [(R/S)&#8208;1] is presented, which exhibits efficient CPL emissions with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and high dissymmetry factors of &#177; 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Notably, (R/S)&#8208;1 compounds exhibit unprecedented and bright circularly polarized mechanoluminescence (CPML) emissions under mechanical stimulation. Moreover, (R/S)&#8208;1 possess high mechanical force sensitivities with mechanoluminescence (ML) emissions detectable under 0.1 N force stimulation. Furthermore, this ML emission exhibits an extraordinary antithermal quenching effect in the temperature range of 300&#8211;380 K, which is revealed to originate from a thermal activation energy compensation mechanism from trap levels to Mn(II) 4T1 level. Based on their intriguing optical properties, these compounds as chiral force&#8208;responsive materials are demonstrated in multilevel confidential information encryption.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Synthesis of Metallic Glass Nanoparticles with Expanded Composition Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically controlled flash carbothermic reaction featuring ultrafast heating and cooling is developed for the general synthesis of Pd&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based metallic glass nanoparticles (MGNPs) with good control over their composition, particle size, dispersity, and supporting substrates. The nanoscale MG has an expanded composition space than its bulk counterpart, revealing that the nanosize effect enhances glass forming ability.








Abstract
Nanoscale metallic glasses offer opportunities for investigating fundamental properties of amorphous solids and technological applications in biomedicine, microengineering, and catalysis. However, their top&#8208;down fabrication is limited by bulk counterpart availability, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis remains underexplored due to strict formation conditions. Here, a kinetically controlled flash carbothermic reaction is developed, featuring ultrafast heating (&gt;105 K s&#8722;1) and cooling rates (&gt;104 K s&#8722;1), for synthesizing metallic glass nanoparticles within milliseconds. Nine compositional permutations of noble metals, base metals, and metalloid (M1&#9472;M2&#9472;P, M1 = Pt/Pd, M2 = Cu/Ni/Fe/Co/Sn) are synthesized with widely tunable particle sizes and substrates. Through combinatorial development, a substantially expanded composition space for nanoscale metallic glass is discovered compared to bulk counterpart, revealing that the nanosize effect enhances glass forming ability. Leveraging this, several nanoscale metallic glasses are synthesized with composition that have never, to the knowledge, been synthesized in bulk. The metallic glass nanoparticles exhibit high activity in heterogeneous catalysis, outperforming crystalline metal alloy nanoparticles.

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering with Tamed Electrode Interphases for High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable operation of high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries with tamed electrode interphase is obtained via innovation in electrolyte chemistry. Benefiting from the suppressed cathode electrolyte interphase dissolution, advanced Na+ storage performance, including outstanding cycling stability as long as 8 months and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8722;25 to 60 &#176;C, is achieved in the high&#8208;voltage Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathode.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the highly instable electrolyte/electrode interphases threaten the long&#8208;term cycling of high&#8208;energy SIBs. In particular, the instable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage causes persistent electrolyte decomposition, transition metal dissolution, and fast capacity fade. Here, this work proposes a balanced principle for the molecular design of SIB electrolytes that enables an ultra&#8208;thin, homogeneous, and robust CEI layer by coupling an intrinsically oxidation&#8208;stable succinonitrile solvent with moderately solvating carbonates. The proposed electrolyte not only shows limited anodic decomposition thus leading to a thin CEI,&#160;but also suppresses dissolution of CEI components at high voltage. Consequently, the tamed electrolyte/electrode interphases enable extremely stable cycling of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with outstanding capacity retention (&gt;90%) over 3000 cycles (8 months) at 1 C with a high charging voltage of 4.3&#8201;V. Further, the NVOPF||hard carbon full cell shows stable cycling over 500&#8201;cycles at 1 C with a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6%. The electrolyte also endows high&#8208;voltage operation of SIBs with great temperature adaptability from &#8722;25 to 60&#160;&#176;C, shedding light on the essence of fundamental electrolyte design for SIBs operating under harsh conditions.

         <title>Bridging the Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis by Supramolecular Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Varied Packing Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of {Cu12} based tetrahedral (Td) metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with varied packing modes are self&#8208;assembled, which act as highly active homogeneous catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides. The varied packing of Td cages from hexagonal to cubic mode in the MOC enables one&#8208;step heterogenous separation of the catalyst, co&#8208;catalyst, and product, which perfectly bridges the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Integrating the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis has proved to be an optimal strategy for developing catalytic systems with high efficiency, selectivity, and recoverability. Supramolecular metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), assembled by the coordination of metal ions with organic linkers into discrete molecules, have performed solvent processability due to their tunable packing modes, endowing them with the potential to act as homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts in different solvent systems. Here, the design and synthesis of a series of stable {Cu3} cluster&#8208;based tetrahedral MOCs with varied packing structures are reported. These MOCs, as homogeneous catalysts, not only show high catalytic activity and selectivity regardless of substrate size during the CO2 cycloaddition reaction, but also can be easily recovered from the reaction media through separating products and co&#8208;catalysts by one&#8208;step work&#8208;up. This is because that these MOCs have varied solubilities in different solvents due to the tunable packing of MOCs in the solid state. Moreover, the entire catalytic reaction system is very clean, and the purity of cyclic carbonates is as high as 97% without further purification. This work provides a unique strategy for developing novel supramolecular catalysts that can be used for homogeneous catalysis and recycled in a heterogeneous manner.

&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) metal-organic cages (MOCs) with varied packing modes are self-assembled, which act as highly active homogeneous catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition with epoxides. The varied packing of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; cages from hexagonal to cubic mode in the MOC enables one-step heterogenous separation of the catalyst, co-catalyst, and product, which perfectly bridges the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off in Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic doping operation of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) renders the understanding of the efficiency roll&#8208;off challenging. Herein, a method for quantification of major LEC loss factors, notably the outcoupling efficiency and exciton quenching, is presented. It reveals that singlet&#8208;polaron quenching strongly affects the efficiency roll&#8208;off in singlet&#8208;emitting LECs because of increasing polaron concentration in the p&#8208;n junction with increasing current .








Abstract
Understanding &#8220;efficiency roll&#8208;off&#8221; (i.e., the drop in emission efficiency with increasing current) is critical if efficient and bright emissive technologies are to be rationally designed. Emerging light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) can be cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiently fabricated by ambient&#8208;air printing by virtue of the in situ formation of a p&#8208;n junction doping structure. However, this in situ doping transformation renders a meaningful efficiency analysis challenging. Herein, a method for separation and quantification of major LEC loss factors, notably the outcoupling efficiency and exciton quenching, is presented. Specifically, the position of the emissive p&#8208;n junction in common singlet&#8208;exciton emitting LECs is measured to shift markedly with increasing current, and the influence of this shift on the outcoupling efficiency is quantified. It is further verified that the LEC&#8208;characteristic high electrochemical&#8208;doping concentration renders singlet&#8208;polaron quenching (SPQ) significant already at low drive current density, but also that SPQ increases super&#8208;linearly with increasing current, because of increasing polaron density in the p&#8208;n junction region. This results in that SPQ dominates singlet&#8208;singlet quenching for relevant current densities, and significantly contributes to the efficiency roll&#8208;off. This method for deciphering the LEC efficiency roll&#8208;off can contribute to a rational realization of all&#8208;printed LEC devices that are efficient at highluminance.

         <title>Charge Carrier Induced Structural Ordering And Disordering in Organic Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of charge density on the stability and operation of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor is examined. Operando X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that charge carriers initially induce order within the crystallites at low charge densities, but further carrier density increases lead to a structural disordering of the crystallites, irreversibly decreasing conductivity and mobility.








Abstract
Operational stability underpins the successful application of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) in a wide range of fields, including biosensing, neuromorphic computing, and wearable electronics. In this work, both the operation and stability of a p&#8208;type OMIEC material of various molecular weights are investigated. Electrochemical transistor measurements reveal that device operation is very stable for at least 300 charging/discharging cycles independent of molecular weight, provided the charge density is kept below the threshold where strong charge&#8211;charge interactions become likely. When electrochemically charged to higher charge densities, an increase in device hysteresis and a decrease in conductivity due to a drop in the hole mobility arising from long&#8208;range microstructural disruptions are observed. By employing operando X&#8208;ray scattering techniques, two regimes of polaron&#8208;induced structural changes are found: 1) polaron&#8208;induced structural ordering at low carrier densities, and 2) irreversible structural disordering that disrupts charge transport at high carrier densities, where charge&#8211;charge interactions are significant. These operando measurements also reveal that the transfer curve hysteresis at high carrier densities is accompanied by an analogous structural hysteresis, providing a microstructural basis for such instabilities. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the structural dynamics and material instabilities of OMIEC materials during device operation.

         <title>Silk Fibroin&#8208;Regulated Nanochannels for Flexible Hydrovoltaic Ion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for controllable nanochannel regulation for flexible hydrovoltaic ion sensing is developed to simultaneously achieve a high surface potential, matching nanochannel size and high structural stability, resulting in a high&#8208;performance hydrovoltaic device with a Voc of 4.82 V in DI water, sensitivity as high as 1.37 V dec&#8722;1, and a sensing range of 10&#8722;7 to 100 M.








Abstract
The evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect based on ion&#8208;selective nanochannels can theoretically be employed for high&#8208;performance ion sensing; yet, the indeterminate ion&#8208;sensing properties and the acquisition of high sensing performance are rarely explored. Herein, a controllable nanochannel regulation strategy for flexible hydrovoltaic devices with highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing abilities is presented across a wide concentration range. By multiple dip&#8208;coating of silk fibroin (SF) on an electrospinning nylon&#8208;66 nanofiber (NNF) film, the surface polarity enhancement, the fibers size regulation with a precision of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and the nanostructure firm binding are achieved simultaneously. The resultant flexible freestanding hydrovoltaic device exhibits an open circuit voltage up to 4.82&#160;V in deionized water, a wide ion sensing range of 10&#8722;7 to 100&#160;m, and ultrahigh sensitivity as high as 1.37&#160;V dec&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the traditional solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes (SC&#8208;ISEs). The fabricated flexible ion&#8208;sensitive hydrovoltaic device is successfully applied for wearable human sweat electrolyte sensing and for environmental trace&#8208;ion monitoring, thereby confirming the potential application of the hydrovoltaic effect for ion sensing.

         <title>Ultraclean Interface of Metal Chalcogenides with Metal through Confined Interfacial Chalcogenization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel confined interfacial chalcogenization (CIC) method to develop robust transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possessing an ultraclean interface with a metal presents a promising alternative to conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CIC&#8208;TMDs overcome limitations associated with CVD such as defects, doping impurities, and degradation, thus proving to be versatile for the development of memristors for electronic devices.








Abstract
Acquisition of defect&#8208;free transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) channels with clean heterojunctions is a critical issue in the production of TMD&#8208;based functional electronic devices. Conventional approaches have transferred TMD onto a target substrate, and then apply the typical device fabrication processes. Unfortunately, those processes cause physical and chemical defects in the TMD channels. Here, a novel synthetic process of TMD thin films, named confined interfacial chalcogenization (CIC) is proposed. In the proposed synthesis, a uniform TMDlayer is created at the Au/transition metal (TM) interface by diffusion of chalcogen through the upper&#160;Au layer and the reaction of chalcogen with the underlying TM. CIC allows for ultraclean heterojunctions with the metals, synthesis of various homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;structured TMDs, and in situ TMD channel formation in the last stage of device fabrication. The mechanism of TMD growth is revealed by the TM&#8208;accelerated chalcogen diffusion, epitaxial growth of TMD on Au(111). We demonstrated a wafer&#8208;scale TMD&#8208;based vertical memristors which exhibit excellent statistical concordance in device performance enabled by the ultraclean heterojunctions and superior uniformity in thickness. CIC proposed in this study represents a breakthrough in in TMD&#8208;based electronic device fabrication and marking a substantial step toward practical next&#8208;generation integrated electronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisition of defect-free transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) channels with clean heterojunctions is a critical issue in the production of TMD-based functional electronic devices. Conventional approaches have transferred TMD onto a target substrate, and then apply the typical device fabrication processes. Unfortunately, those processes cause physical and chemical defects in the TMD channels. Here, a novel synthetic process of TMD thin films, named confined interfacial chalcogenization (CIC) is proposed. In the proposed synthesis, a uniform TMDlayer is created at the Au/transition metal (TM) interface by diffusion of chalcogen through the upper&#160;Au layer and the reaction of chalcogen with the underlying TM. CIC allows for ultraclean heterojunctions with the metals, synthesis of various homo- and hetero-structured TMDs, and in situ TMD channel formation in the last stage of device fabrication. The mechanism of TMD growth is revealed by the TM-accelerated chalcogen diffusion, epitaxial growth of TMD on Au(111). We demonstrated a wafer-scale TMD-based vertical memristors which exhibit excellent statistical concordance in device performance enabled by the ultraclean heterojunctions and superior uniformity in thickness. CIC proposed in this study represents a breakthrough in in TMD-based electronic device fabrication and marking a substantial step toward practical next-generation integrated electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Memtransistors with Magnetized Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;selective memtransistor with magnetized single&#8208;layered graphene on a reactive antiferromagnetic CrI3 is reported. The spin&#8208;dependent hybridization between graphene and CrI3 atomic layers enables the spin&#8208;selective bandgap opening in the single&#8208;layered graphene and the electric field control of magnetization in a specific CrI3 layer, which achieves reliable memtransistor operations based on the electrical control of the magnetic proximity effect.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized bands in pristine and proximity&#8208;induced magnetic materials are promising building blocks for future devices. Conceptually new memory, logic, and neuromorphic devices are conceived based on atomically thin magnetic materials and the manipulation of their spin&#8208;polarized bands via electrical and optical methods. A critical remaining issue is the direct probe and the optimized use of the magnetic coupling effect in van der Waals heterostructures, which requires further delicate design of atomically thin magnetic materials and devices. Here, a spin&#8208;selective memtransistor with magnetized single&#8208;layered graphene on a reactive antiferromagnetic material, CrI3, is reported. The spin&#8208;dependent hybridization between graphene and CrI3 atomic layers enables the spin&#8208;selective bandgap opening in the single&#8208;layered graphene and the electric field control of magnetization in a specific CrI3 layer. The microscopic working principle is clarified by the first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical analysis of the transport data. Reliable memtransistor operations (i.e., memory and logic device&#8208;combined operations), as well as a spin&#8208;selective probe of Landau levels in the magnetized graphene, are achieved by using the subtle manipulation of the magnetic proximity effect via electrical means.

         <title>Nanoengineered Red Blood Cells Loaded with TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin L Inhibitors Block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Pseudovirus Entry into Lung ACE2+ Cells</title>

Dual&#8208;drug&#8208;combined (Camostat and E&#8208;64d) nanocarriers (NCs) are constructed, conjugated with an anti&#8208;hACE2 antibody and employed RBC&#8208;hitchhiking, termed &#8220;Nanoengineered RBCs&#8221;, for effectively blocking SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 cell entry in the lungs, regardless of virus variations. The nano&#8208;micro system is modular (anti&#8208;receptor antibody + drug&#8208;loaded NCs + RBCs), and the findings will benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host&#8208;cell&#8208;protecting antiviral therapies.








Abstract
The enzymatic activities of Furin, Transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), Cathepsin L (CTSL), and Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding are necessary for the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. Precise inhibition of these key proteases in ACE2+ lung cells during a viral infection cycle shall prevent viral Spike (S) protein activation and its fusion with a host cell membrane, consequently averting virus entry to the cells. In this study, dual&#8208;drug&#8208;combined (TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat and CTSL inhibitor E&#8208;64d) nanocarriers (NCs) are constructed conjugated with an anti&#8208;human ACE2 (hACE2) antibody and employ Red Blood Cell (RBC)&#8208;hitchhiking, termed &#8220;Nanoengineered RBCs,&#8221; for targeting lung cells. The significant therapeutic efficacy of the dual&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded nanoengineered RBCs in pseudovirus&#8208;infected K18&#8208;hACE2 transgenic mice is reported. Notably, the modular nanoengineered RBCs (anti&#8208;receptor antibody+NCs+RBCs) precisely target key proteases of host cells in the lungs to block the entry of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), regardless of virus variations. These findings are anticipated to benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host&#8208;cell&#8208;protecting antiviral therapies.

         <title>Revealing the Substrate Constraint Effect on the Thermodynamic Behaviour of the Pd&#8211;H through Capacitive&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Sorption Measurement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate constraint effect on the metal&#8211;hydrogen system can result in significant mechanical stress during hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion. However, a quantitative study of this effect is challenging due to the limitations in measurement techniques. In this study, a capacitive&#8208;based measurement system is employed to reveal the influence of substrate constraint on the thermodynamic behavior of the Pd&#8211;H system.








Abstract
Mechanical constraints imposed on the Pd&#8211;H system can induce significant strain upon hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion, potentially leading to changes in the thermodynamic behavior, such as the phase&#8208;transition pressure. However, the investigation of the constraint effect is often tricky due to the lack of simple experimental techniques for measuring hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion. In this study, a capacitive&#8208;based measurement system is developed to monitor hydrogenation&#8208;induced areal expansion, which allows us to control and evaluate the magnitude of the substrate constraint. By using the measurement technique, the influence of substrate constraint intensity on the thermodynamic behavior of the Pd&#8211;H system is investigated. Through experiments with different constraint intensities, it is found that the diffefrence in the constraint intensity minimally affects the phase&#8208;transition pressure when the Pd&#8211;H system allows the release of constraint stress through plastic deformation. These experiments can improve the understanding of the substrate constraint behaviours of Pd&#8211;H systems allowing plastic deformation while demonstrating the potential of capacitive&#8208;based measurement systems to study the mechanical&#8211;thermodynamic coupling of M&#8211;H systems.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Pouch Cell Using Cu3P Nanowires In Situ Grown on Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu3P nanowires in situ grown on the current collector are capable of realizing uniform deposition of sodium metal during repeated cycling, which is attributed to low Na+ absorption energy and diffusion energy barrier on Na3P. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode successfully enables anode&#8208;free sodium metal pouch cell with stable cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AFSMB) promises high energy density but suffers from the difficulty of maintaining high cycling stability. Nonuniform sodium (Na) deposition on the current collector is largely responsible for capacity decay in the cycling process of AFSMB. Here, a unique copper phosphide (Cu3P) nanowire is constructed on copper (Cu3P@Cu) as a sodium deposition substrate by an in situ growth method. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode is delivered in asymmetric cells with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for over 800 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mA h cm&#8722;2. The symmetric cell of Cu3P@Cu displayed a cycling lifespan of over 2000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mA h cm&#8722;2. Cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscope&#160;characterization and first principles calculation revealed that the low Na+ absorption energy and low Na+ diffusion energy barrier on Na3P promoted uniform Na nucleation and deposition, thus enhancing the Na surface stability. Moreover, anode&#8208;free Na3V2(PO4)3//Cu3P@Cu full pouch cell delivered a considerable cycling capacity of &#8776;15&#160;mA h in 170 cycles, demonstrating its practical feasibility.

Cryo-transmission electron microscope&#160;characterization and first principles calculation revealed that the low Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; absorption energy and low Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion energy barrier on Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P promoted uniform Na nucleation and deposition, thus enhancing the Na surface stability. Moreover, anode-free Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;//Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P@Cu full pouch cell delivered a considerable cycling capacity of &#8776;15&#160;mA h in 170 cycles, demonstrating its practical feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Performance Enhancement of the Li6PS5Cl&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries by Scavenging Lithium Dendrites with LaCl3&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the ability of Li6PS5Cl against Li dendrites for developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries, inserting a thin layer of LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte inside Li6PS5Cl produces a sandwich&#8208;structured composite electrolyte, which presents greatly&#8208;improved critical current density, cycling lifetime and rate capability. The enhancing mechanism is assigned to the Li&#8208;scavenging capability of the LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte.








Abstract
Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) is a very attractive sulfide solid electrolyte for developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, it cannot suppress the growth of lithium dendrites and then can only tolerate a small critical current density (CCD) before getting short&#8208;circuited to death. Learning from that a newly&#8208;developed LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte (LTLC) can afford a very large CCD, a three&#8208;layer sandwich&#8208;structured electrolyte is designed by inserting LTLC inside LPSC. Remarkably, compared with bland LPSC, this hybrid electrolyte LPSC/LTLC/LPSC presents extraordinary performance improvements: the CCD gets increased from 0.51 to 1.52&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the lifetime gets prolonged from 7&#160;h to &gt;500&#160;h at the cycling current of 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and the cyclability gets extended from 10 cycles to &gt;200 cycles at the cycling rate of 0.5&#160;C and 30&#160;&#176;C in Li|electrolyte|NCM721 full cells. The enhancing reasons are assigned to the capability of LTLC to scavenge lithium dendrites, forming a passive layer of Ta, La, and LiCl.

         <title>Interior&#8208;Confined Vacancy in Potassium Manganese Hexacyanoferrate for Ultra&#8208;Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface repair strategy is proposed to reduce the content of Fe(CN)6 vacancies (VFeCN) in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF). KMHCF with 2% VFeCN is obtained at 90 &#176;C, and VFeCN is mainly concentrated in the lattice interior. The eliminated surface VFeCN can inhibit the Mn2+ dissolution into the electrolyte, resulting in excellent cycling performance in potassium ion batteries.








Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are viewed as promising cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) because of their high theoretical capacities and redox potentials. However, the development of an HCF cathode with high cycling stability and voltage retention is still impeded by the unavoidable Fe(CN)6 vacancies (VFeCN) and H2O in the materials. Here, a repair method is proposed that significantly reduces the VFeCN content in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) enabled by the reducibility of sodium citrate and removal of ligand H2O at high temperature (KMHCF&#8208;H). The KMHCF&#8208;H obtained at 90 &#176;C contains only 2% VFeCN, and the VFeCN is concentrated in the lattice interior. Such an integrated Fe&#8211;CN&#8211;Mn surface structure of the KMHCF&#8208;H cathode with repaired surface VFeCN allows preferential decomposition of potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in the electrolyte, which constitutes a dense anion&#8208;dominated cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) , inhibiting effectively Mn dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the KMHCF&#8208;H cathode exhibits excellent cycling performance for both half&#8208;cell (95.2 % at 0.2 Ag&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles) and full&#8208;cell (99.4 % at 0.1 Ag&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). This thermal repair method enables scalable preparation of KMHCF with a low content of vacancies, holding substantial promise for practical applications of PIBs.

         <dc:description>
Electrically controllable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene&#8208;dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate signifies a breakthrough in optical switching, achieving a modulation depth surpassing 88% (&#8776;99% theoretically) in the near&#8208;infrared range at sub&#8208;1&#8208;volt levels. This device holds the potential to accelerate advancements in scalable optical modulators and non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical devices. Consequently, it extends applications to rewritable optical memory storage with neuromorphic behavior.








Abstract
Reconfigurable optical devices hold great promise for advancing high&#8208;density optical interconnects, photonic switching, and memory applications. While many optical modulators based on active materials have been demonstrated, it is challenging to achieve a high modulation depth with a low operation voltage in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range, which is a highly sought&#8208;after wavelength window for free&#8208;space communication and imaging applications. Here, electrically switchable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is introduced. The device allows for a high modulation depth across the entire NIR range by fully absorbing incident light even under epsilon near zero conditions. Optical modulation exceeding 88% is achieved using a CMOS&#8208;compatible voltage of &#177;1&#160;V. This modulation is facilitated by precise electrical control of the charge carrier density through an electrochemical doping/dedoping process. Additionally, the potential applications of the device are extended for a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical device, capable of rewritable optical memory storage and exhibiting long&#8208;term potentiation/depression properties with neuromorphic behavior.

         <title>A Photolithographable Electrolyte for Deeply Rechargeable Zn Microbatteries in On&#8208;Chip Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caffeine is introduced to ZnSO4 solution, forming a photolithographable electrolyte with an ultraviolet light curable polymer. Zn&#8208;rich interphase is built up over cycling, and stabilizes the Zn anode and hence reversibility of both half and full cells over a broad dimension from several centimeters down to hundreds of micrometers.








Abstract
Zn batteries show promise for microscale applications due to their compatibility with air fabrication but face challenges like dendrite growth and chemical corrosion, especially at the microscale. Despite previous attempts in electrolyte engineering, achieving successful patterning of electrolyte microscale devices has remained challenging. Here, successful patterning using photolithography is enabled by incorporating caffeine into a UV&#8208;crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte. Caffeine passivates the Zn anode, preventing chemical corrosion, while its coordination with Zn2+ ions forms a Zn2+&#8208;conducting complex that transforms into ZnCO3 and 2ZnCO3&#183;3Zn(OH)2 over cycling. The resulting Zn&#8208;rich interphase product significantly enhances Zn reversibility. In on&#8208;chip microbatteries, the resulting solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase allows the Zn||MnO2 full cell to cycle for over 700 cycles with an 80% depth of discharge. Integrating the photolithographable electrolyte into multilayer microfabrication creates a microbattery with a 3D Swiss&#8208;roll structure that occupies a footprint of 0.136 mm2. This tiny microbattery retains 75% of its capacity (350 &#181;Ah cm&#8722;2) for 200 cycles at a remarkable 90% depth of discharge. The findings offer a promising solution for enhancing the performance of Zn microbatteries, particularly for on&#8208;chip microscale devices, and have significant implications for the advancement of autonomous microscale devices.

Caffeine passivates the Zn anode, preventing chemical corrosion, while its coordination with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions forms a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-conducting complex that transforms into ZnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 2ZnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;3Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over cycling. The resulting Zn-rich interphase product significantly enhances Zn reversibility. In on-chip microbatteries, the resulting solid-electrolyte interphase allows the Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell to cycle for over 700 cycles with an 80% depth of discharge. Integrating the photolithographable electrolyte into multilayer microfabrication creates a microbattery with a 3D Swiss-roll structure that occupies a footprint of 0.136 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This tiny microbattery retains 75% of its capacity (350 &#181;Ah cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for 200 cycles at a remarkable 90% depth of discharge. The findings offer a promising solution for enhancing the performance of Zn microbatteries, particularly for on-chip microscale devices, and have significant implications for the advancement of autonomous microscale devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Polymer Framework Strategy Enabling Printable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells by Mitigating &#8220;Coffee Ring&#8221; Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a 3D framework formed by spontaneous cross&#8208;linking is introduced in perovskite precursor to increase their viscosity and homogenize their heat diffusion coefficient. As a result, the Marangoni convection intensity during meniscus printing is properly controlled, thus ensuring the deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite films and significantly enhancing the reproducibility in printing efficient photovoltaics by mitigating the coffee&#8208;ring effect.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites are considered ideal candidates for future photovoltaic applications due to their excellent photovoltaic properties. Although solution&#8208;printed manufacturing has shown inherent potential for the low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;throughput production of thin&#8208;film semiconductor electronics, the high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;reproducibility deposition of large&#8208;area perovskite remains a bottleneck that restricts their commercialization due to the droplet coffee&#8208;ring effect (CRE). In this study, these issues are addressed by introducing an in situ polymer framework. The 3D framework formed by spontaneous cross&#8208;linking improves the precursor viscosity and homogenizes its heat diffusion coefficient, counteracting the lateral capillary flow of the colloidal particles and anchoring their flocculent movement. Thus, the Marangoni convection intensity is properly controlled to ensure high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which significantly enhances reproducibility in printing efficient photovoltaics by mitigating the CRE. Subsequently, the perovskite solar cells and modules achieve power conversion efficiencies of 23.94 and 17.53%, and exhibit positive environmental stability, retaining over 90 and 78% efficiency after storage for 2500 and 1600&#160;h, respectively. This work may serves as a foundation for exploring precursor rheology to match the homogeneous deposition requirements of perovskite photovoltaics and facilitating the advancement of their printing manufacturing and commercialization transition.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Activation in ReSe2&#8208;VSe2 Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Water&#8208;Splitting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Re1&#8722;xVxSe2 alloy nanosheets consisted of atomic structures that boost synergically the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction over a wide composition range.








Abstract
It is challenging to control the electronic structure of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) for extended applications in renewable energy devices. Here, ReSe2&#8208;VSe2 (Re1&#8722;xVxSe2) alloy nanosheets over the whole composition range via a colloidal reaction is synthesized. Increasing x makes the nanosheets more metallic and induces a 1T&#8243;&#8208;to&#8208;1T phase transition at x = 0.5&#8211;0.6. Compared to the MoSe2&#8208;VSe2 and WSe2&#8208;VSe2 alloy nanosheets, ReSe2 and VSe2 are mixed more homogeneously at the atomic scale. The alloy nanosheets at x = 0.1&#8211;0.7 exhibit an enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that alloying caused the Re and V atoms to be synergically more active in the HER. Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH*) and density of state calculations confirm that alloying and Se vacancies effectively activate the metal sites toward HER. The composition dependence of HER performance is explained by homogenous atomic mixing with the increased Se vacancies. The study provides a strategy for designing new TMD alloy nanosheets with enhanced catalytic activity.

         <title>Concurrent Mechanisms of Hot Electrons and Interfacial Water Molecule Ordering in Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the disordered arrangement, water molecules on the solid&#8211;liquid interface exhibit weakened hydrogen bonds accompanied by an ordered distribution under the LSPR effect excited by light illumination, which leads to an improved electron transfer efficiency and proton supply; therefore, enhancing the NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency in NRR.








Abstract
The participation of high&#8208;energy hot electrons generated from the non&#8208;radiative decay of localized surface plasmons is an important mechanism for promoting catalytic processes. Herein, another vital mechanism associated with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, significantly contributing to the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), is found. That is to say, the LSPR&#8208;induced strong localized electric fields can weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and regulate the arrangement of water molecules at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The AuCu pentacle nanoparticles with excellent light absorption ability and the capability to generate strong localized electric fields are chosen to demonstrate this effect. The in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations are employed to verify the mechanism at the molecular scale in a nitrogen fixation process. Meanwhile, due to the promoted electron transfer at the interface by the well&#8208;ordered interfacial water, as well as the participation of high&#8208;energy hot electrons, the optimal catalyst exhibits excellent performance with an NH3 yield of 52.09 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.82% at &#9472;0.20&#160;V versus RHE. The results are significant for understanding the LSPR effect in catalysis and provide a new approach for regulating the reaction process.

         <title>Bioinspired Tumor Calcification&#8208;Guided Early Diagnosis and Eradication of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SA@CaO2 MSs combined with transcatheter arterial embolization&#160;(TAE) technology can initiate tumor calcification, and facilitate the tumor clinical diagnosis, which is of great significance in differentiating tumor response during early follow&#8208;up periods. Additionally, research also shows that upregulated calreticulin (CALR) in association with tumor calcification, which may be broadly useful for quick visualization of tumor response.








Abstract
Tumor calcification is found to be associated with the benign prognostic, and which shows considerable promise as a somewhat predictive index of the tumor response clinically. However, calcification is still a missing area in clinical cancer treatment. A specific strategy is proposed for inducing tumor calcification through the synergy of calcium peroxide (CaO2)&#8208;based microspheres and transcatheter arterial embolization for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The persistent calcium stress in situ specifically leads to powerful tumor calcioptosis, resulting in diffuse calcification and a high&#8208;density shadow on computed tomography that enables clear localization of the in vivo tumor site and partial delineation of tumor&#160;margins in an orthotopic HCC rabbit model. This osmotic calcification can facilitate tumor clinical diagnosis, which is of great significance in differentiating tumor response during early follow&#8208;up periods. Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis identify that calreticulin (CALR) is a crucial target protein involved in tumor calcioptosis. Further fluorescence molecular imaging analysis also indicates that CALR can be used as a prodromal marker of calcification to predict tumor response at an earlier stage in different preclinical rodent models. These findings suggest that upregulated CALR in association with tumor calcification, which may be broadly useful for quick visualization of tumor response.

Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, a protease&#8208;sensitive TNC and FN1&#8208;binding peptide (FTF) is designed and an extracellular matrix&#8208;trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) system (FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP) is proposed that can preferentially bind to the FN1 and TNC in tumors to prolong their retention capacity, thereby profoundly potentiating the antitumor immunity and producing notable therapeutic benefits .








Abstract
The immunomodulatory effects of many therapeutic agents are significantly challenged by their insufficient delivery efficiency and short retention time in tumors. Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, herein a protease&#8208;activated FN1 and/or TNC binding peptide (FTF) is designed and an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) (FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP) is proposed that can be preferentially captured by the TNC and/or FN1 for tumor retention, and then be responsively dissociated from the matrix to potentiate the antitumor immunity. The FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP treatment produces a 6.96&#8208;, 9.24&#8208;, 6.72&#8208;, 7.32&#8208;, and 6.73&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells and their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208;, granzyme B&#8208;, perforin&#8208;, and Ki67&#8208;expressing subtypes versus the negative control, thereby profoundly eliciting the antitumor immunity. In orthotopic and lung metastatic breast cancer models, FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarding tumor growth, extending survivals, and inhibiting lung metastasis. Therefore, this ECM&#8208;trapping strategy provides an encouraging possibility of prolonging tumor retention to potentiate the antitumor immunity for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Green Asymmetric Bicyclic Co&#8208;Solvent Molecule for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Isosorbide dimethyl ether (IDE) is used as a green co&#8208;solvent for high&#8208;voltage, low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration hybrid aqueous electrolytes. The unique 3D molecular structure of IDE enables anion&#8208;participated solvation structures and optimized hydrogen bonding networks, effectively expanding the voltage window to 4.3 V and achieving an outstanding cycling performance for the LTO|| LMO full cell over 450 cycles at 2 C.








Abstract
Hybridizing aqueous electrolytes with organic co&#8208;solvents can effectively expand the voltage window of aqueous electrolytes while reducing salt usage, but most reported co&#8208;solvents are usually flammable and toxic, hardly achieving compatibility between safety and electrochemical performance. Here, a new non&#8208;flammable and non&#8208;toxic low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration (1.85 m) aqueous electrolyte is reported using the green co&#8208;solvent isosorbide dimethyl ether (IDE). Owing to its unique 3D molecular structure, IDE can form a five&#8208;membered ring structure by binding the Li ion. The steric hindrance effect from IDE weakens its solvation ability, generating anion&#8208;participated solvation structures that produce a robust and uniform LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer while containing elastic IDE&#8208;derived organics. Moreover, the multiple O atoms in IDE can effectively regulate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks, reducing H2O molecule activity and expanding the electrochemical window. Such unique solvation structures and optimized hydrogen bonding networks enabled by IDE effectively suppress electrode/electrolyte interfacial side reactions, achieving a 4.3 V voltage window. The as&#8208;developed Li4Ti5O12(LTO)||LiMn2O4(LMO) full cell delivers outstanding cycling performance over 450 cycles at 2 C. The proposed green hybrid aqueous electrolyte provides a new pathway for developing high&#8208;voltage aqueous lithium batteries.

         <title>A Novel N&#8208;Type Molecular Dopant With a Closed&#8208;Shell Electronic Structure Applicable to the Vacuum&#8208;Deposition Process</title>

n&#8208;type materials are known to lag behind p&#8208;type materials in the organic electronics field, which is not only for semiconducting materials but also for n&#8208;type dopants, the status quo of which is not quite satisfactory. Here, a novel n&#8208;type molecular dopant applicable to the vacuum&#8208;deposition process is reported, as well as its applications to organic thermoelectric materials and field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Rational design, synthesis, and characterization of a new efficient versatile n&#8208;type dopant with a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure are described. By employing the tetraphenyl&#8211;dipyranylidene (DP0) framework with two 7&#960;&#8208;electron systems modified with N,N&#8208;dimethylamino groups as the strong electron&#8208;donating substituent, 2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis[4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyranylidene (DP7), a closed&#8208;shell molecule with an extremely high&#8208;lying energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital, close to 4.0&#160;eV below the vacuum level, is successfully developed. Thanks to its thermal stability, DP7 is applicable to vacuum deposition, which allows utilization of DP7 in bulk doping for the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials and contact doping for reducing contact resistance in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors. As vacuum&#8208;deposition processable n&#8208;type dopants are very limited, DP7 stands out as a useful n&#8208;type dopant, particularly for the latter purpose.

         <title>Perforin&#8208;Mimicking Molecular Drillings Enable Macroporous Hollow Lignin Spheres for Performance&#8208;Configurable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse perforin&#8208;mimicking molecular drills are employed to engineer lignin hollow spheres for noncovalent assembly, directing synthesis, polymerization, and catalysis. The exceptional performance mutations correlate with the changes in macro&#8208;openings, including enhancement in catalytic efficiency, transition from nonstick synthetics to ultrastrong adhesives, and transformation of viscous sols to tough nanogels.








Abstract
Despite the first observations that the perforin can punch holes in target cells for live/dead cycles in the human immune system over 110 years ago, emulating this behavior in materials science remains challenging. Here, a perforin&#8208;mimicking molecular drilling strategy is employed to engineer macroporous hollow lignin spheres as performance&#8208;configurable catalysts, adhesives, and gels. Using a toolbox of over 20 molecular compounds, the local curvature of amphiphilic lignin is modulated to generate macroporous spheres with hole sizes ranging from 0 to 100&#160;nm. Multiscale control is precisely achieved through noncovalent assembly directing catalysis, synthesis, and polymerization. Exceptional performance mutations correlate with the changes in hole size, including an increase in catalytic efficiency from 50% to 100%, transition from nonstick synthetics to ultrastrong adhesives (adhesion &#8776;18.3&#160;MPa, exceeding that of classic epoxies), and transformation of viscous sols to tough nanogels. Thus, this study provides a robust and versatile noncovalent route for mimicking perforin&#8208;induced structural variations in cells, representing a significant stride toward the exquisite orchestration of assemblies over multiple length scales.

Small&#8208;molecule/covalent sulfur is confined in carbon layers (SMCS@C) with a record&#8208;high SMCS content of 74.1&#160;wt%. A novel FSI&#8722; regulated sulfur conversion chemistry is observed in K&#8211;S battery, leading to fast and more efficient S conversion. The SMCS@C//K full cells show energy/power densities of 72.8 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 873.2 W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries have attracted attention in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. Small&#8208;molecule/covalent sulfur (SMCS) can help to avoid the shuttle effect of polysulfide ions via solid&#8211;solid sulfur conversion. However, the content of SMCS is relatively low (&#8804;40%), and solid&#8211;solid reactions cause sluggish kinetics and low discharge potentials. Herein, SMCS is confined in turbo carbon layers with a content of &#8776;74.1&#160;wt% via a C/S co&#8208;deposition process. In the K&#8211;S battery assembled by using as&#8208;fabricated SMCS@C as cathode and KFSI&#8208;EC/DEC as an electrolyte, anion&#8208;regulated two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state S conversion chemistry and a novel high discharge potential plateau at 2.5&#8211;2.0&#160;V with a remarkable reversible capacity of 384&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles are found. The SMCS@C||K full cell showed energy and power density of 72.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 873.2&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Mechanism&#160;studies&#160;reveal&#160;that the&#160;enlarged carbon layer space enables the diffusion of K+&#8208;FSI&#8208;&#160;ion pairs, and the coulombic attraction between them accelerates their diffusion in SMCS@C. In addition, FSI&#8722;&#160;regulates sulfur conversion in situ inside the&#160;carbon layers along a two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state reaction pathway, which lowers the free energy and weakens the S&#9472;S bond of intermediates, leading to faster and more efficient S conversion.

         <title>Switchable Design of Redox&#8208;Enhanced Nonaromatic Quinones Enabled by Conjugation Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Groundbreaking study introduces a novel switchable design strategy aimed at enhancing the intrinsic redox potentials of quinones by restoring conjugated but nonaromatic backbone architecture. The research establishes the recovery of backbone conjugation and optimal utilization of inductive effect of electronic localization near electron&#8208;withdrawing areas and suppressing resonance effect of electronic delocalization in the switched quinones.








Abstract
An innovative switchable design strategy for modulating the electronic structures of quinones is proposed herein, leading to remarkably enhanced intrinsic redox potentials by restoring conjugated but nonaromatic backbone architectures. Computational validation of two fundamental hypotheses confirms the recovery of backbone conjugation and optimal utilization of the inductive effect in switched quinones, which affords significantly improved redox chemistry and overall performance compared to reference quinones. Geometric and electronic analyses provide strong evidence for the restored backbone conjugation and nonaromaticity in the switched quinones, while highlighting the reinforcement of the inductive effect and suppression of the resonance effect. This strategic approach facilitates the development of an exceptional quinone, viz. 2,6&#8208;naphthoquinone, with outstanding performance parameters (338.9 mAh g&#8722;1 and 912.9 mWh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, 2,6&#8208;anthraquinone with superior cyclic stability, demonstrates comparable performance (257.4 mAh g&#8722;1 and 702.8 mWh g&#8722;1). These findings offer valuable insights into the design of organic cathode materials with favorable redox chemistry in secondary batteries.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Electrochemical Synthesis of Multiyolk&#8211;Shell Nanocoils for Exceptional Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study endeavors to devise a synthesis strategy for multiyolk&#8211;shell nanocoils (mYSNC) by capitalizing on the disparate behaviors exhibited by bimetallic alloys within electrochemically programmed mild solutions. The resulting Au&#8208;FePO4 mYSNC demonstrates broad&#8208;spectrum light absorption capabilities and exhibits enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Multiyolk&#8211;shell (mYS)&#160;nanostructures have garnered significant interest in various photocatalysis applications such as water splitting and waste treatment. Nonetheless, the complexity and rigorous conditions for the synthesis have hindered their widespread implementation. This study presents a one&#8208;step electrochemical strategy for synthesizing multiyolk&#8211;shell nanocoils (mYSNC), wherein multiple cores of noble metal nanoparticles, such as Au, are embedded within the hollow coil&#8208;shaped FePO4 shell structures, mitigating the challenges posed by conventional methods. By capitalizing on the dissimilar dissolution rates of bimetallic alloy nanocoils in an electrochemically programmed solution, nanocoils of different shapes and materials, including two variations of mYSNCs are successfully fabricated. The resulting Au&#8208;FePO4 mYSNCs exhibit exceptional photocatalytic performance for environmental remediation, demonstrating up to 99% degradation of methylene blue molecules within 50&#160;min and 95% degradation of tetracycline within 100&#160;min under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8208;vis) light source. This remarkable performance can be attributed to the abundant electrochemical active sites, internal voids facilitating efficient light harvesting with coil morphology, amplified localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at the plasmonic nanoparticle&#8208;semiconductor interface, and effective band engineering. The innovative approach utilizing bimetallic alloys demonstrates precise geometric control and design of intricate multicomponent hybrid composites, showcasing the potential for developing versatile hollow nanomaterials for catalytic applications.

         <title>Soft&#8208;Hard Janus Nanoparticles Triggered Hierarchical Conductors with Large Stretchability, High Sensitivity, and Superior Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical conductor for decoupling the mechanical/electrical module is developed based on the soft&#8208;hard Janus nanoparticles (JNPs). Its mechanically stretchable layer can evenly disperse stress and dissipate energy, and a flexible conductive network layer can impede the crack propagation and achieve local reconstruction, giving the carbon&#8208;based sensor a wide strain range, high sensitivity, and excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
There is a long&#8208;standing conflict between the large stretchability and high sensitivity for strain sensors, a strategy of decoupling the mechanical/electrical module by constructing the hierarchical conductor has been developed in this study. The hierarchical conductor, consisting of a mechanically stretchable layer, a conductive network layer, and a strongly bonded interface, can be produced in a simple one&#8208;step process with the aid of soft&#8208;hard Janus nanoparticles (JNPs). The introduction of JNPs in the stretchable layer can evenly distribute stress and dissipate energy due to forming the rigid&#8208;flexible homogeneous networks. Specifically, JNPs can drive graphene nanosheets (GNS) to fold or curl, creating the unique JNPs&#8208;GNS building block that can further construct the conductive network. Due to its excellent deformability to hinder crack propagation, the flexible conductive network could be stretched continuously and the local conductive pathways could be reconstructed. Consequently, the hierarchical conductor could detect both subtle strain of 0&#8722;2% and large strain of up to 370%, with a gauge factor (GF) from 66.37 to 971.70, demonstrating outstanding stretchability and sensitivity. And it also owns large tensile strength (5.28&#160;MPa) and high deformation stability. This hierarchical design will give graphene&#8208;based sensors a major boost in emerging applications.

This study has fabricated homomultivalent supramolecular nanotraps (PTMCD4) by adjusting the density of heptakis (2,3,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;methyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin on the polymer, which effectively reduces phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol levels in tumor cells for perturbed lipid metabolism homeostasis and induces lysosomal stress for tumor cell pyroptosis.








Abstract
Genetic manipulations and pharmaceutical interventions to disturb lipid metabolism homeostasis have emerged as an attractive approach for the management of cancer. However, the research on the utilization of bioactive materials to modulate lipid metabolism homeostasis remains constrained. In this study, heptakis (2,3,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;methyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMCD) is utilized to fabricate homomultivalent polymeric nanotraps, and surprisingly, its unprecedented ability to perturb lipid metabolism homeostasis and induce pyroptosis in tumor cells is found. Through modulation of the density of TMCD arrayed on the polymers, one top&#8208;performing nanotrap, PTMCD4, exhibits the most powerful cholesterol&#8208;trapping and depletion capacity, thus achieving prominent cytotoxicity toward different types of tumor cells and encouraging antitumor effects in vivo. The interactions between PTMCD4 and biomembranes of tumor cells effectively enable the reduction of cellular phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol levels, thus provoking damage to the biomembrane integrity and perturbation of lipid metabolism homeostasis. Additionally, the interplays between PTMCD4 and lysosomes also induce lysosomal stress, activate the nucleotide&#8208;binding oligomerization domain&#8208;like receptor protein 3 inflammasomes, and subsequently trigger tumor cell pyroptosis. To sum up, this study first introduces dendronized bioactive polymers to manipulate lipid metabolism and has shed light on another innovative insight for cancer therapy.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optical Multiclassification Platform for Minimizing Occasional Inaccuracy in Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Biomarker Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;mode multiclassification diagnostic platform enhances anti&#8208;interference ability in rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs) with multivariable disturbances, and reduces the occasional inaccuracy mathematically. By validating 501 unprocessed clinical samples in serum and nasopharyngeal/anal swabs, the platform achieves a &#8776;99% accuracy at 100% statistical power and a sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer time of 5 min, realizing on&#8208;site diagnosis with accuracy similar to routine laboratory tests.








Abstract
On&#8208;site diagnostic tests that accurately identify disease biomarkers lay the foundation for self&#8208;healthcare applications. However, these tests routinely rely on single&#8208;mode signals and suffer from insufficient accuracy, especially for multiplexed point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs) within a few minutes. Here, this work develops a dual&#8208;mode multiclassification diagnostic platform that integrates an electrochemiluminescence sensor and a field&#8208;effect transistor sensor in a microfluidic chip. The microfluidic channel guides the testing samples to flow across electro&#8208;optical sensor units, which produce dual&#8208;mode readouts by detecting infectious biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB), human rhinovirus (HRV), and group B streptococcus (GBS). Then, machine&#8208;learning classifiers generate three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hyperplanes to diagnose different diseases. Dual&#8208;mode readouts derived from distinct mechanisms enhance the anti&#8208;interference ability physically, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided diagnosis in high&#8208;dimensional space reduces the occasional inaccuracy mathematically. Clinical validation studies with 501 unprocessed samples indicate that the platform has an accuracy approaching 99%, higher than the 77%&#8211;93% accuracy of rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing technologies at 100% statistical power (&gt;150 clinical tests). Moreover, the diagnosis time is 5&#160;min without a trade&#8208;off of accuracy. This work solves the occasional inaccuracy issue of rapid on&#8208;site diagnosis, endowing POCT systems with the same accuracy as laboratory tests and holding unique prospects for complicated scenes of personalized healthcare.

         <title>Boosting Efficient and Sustainable Alkaline Water Oxidation on a W&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT Pair&#8208;Sites Catalyst Synthesized via Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general potential cycling topochemical transformation (&#8220;PCTT&#8221;) strategy is used to convert M&#8208;Co9S8 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) into M&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT pair sites (M = W, Mo, Mn, V) under the modulation of atomically dispersed high&#8208;valence metals; this TT process can be confirmed by in situ
XAFS. The prepared tungsten&#8208;based pair&#8208;sites catalyst makes a breakthrough of 3000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 high current density and 1000&#160;h long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, the O&#9472;O bond formation process on two Co sites is well confirmed by in situ synchrotron radiation infrared and density functional theory, which breaks the limit of the adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relationship on conventional single&#8208;sites.








Abstract
The development of facile methods for constructing highly active, cost&#8208;effective catalysts that meet ampere&#8208;level current density and durability requirements for an oxygen evolution reaction is crucial. Herein, a general topochemical transformation strategy is posited: M&#8208;Co9S8 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are directly converted into M&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT (M&#8201;=&#8201;W, Mo, Mn, V) pair&#8208;sites catalysts under the role of incorporating of atomically dispersed high&#8208;valence metals modulators through potential cycling. Furthermore, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy is used to track the dynamic topochemical transformation process at the atomic level. The W&#8208;Co9S8 breaks through the low overpotential of 160&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. A series of pair&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a large current density of approaching 1760&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.68&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in alkaline water oxidation and achieve a &#8776;240&#8208;fold enhancement in the normalized intrinsic activity compare to that reported CoOOH, and sustainable stability of 1000&#160;h. Moreover, the O&#9472;O bond formation is confirmed via a two&#8208;site mechanism, supported by in situ synchrotron radiation infrared and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which breaks the limit of adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relationship on conventional single&#8208;site.

         <title>Tunable Donor Aggregation Dominance in a Ternary Matrix of All&#8208;Polymer Blends with Improved Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;acceptor strategy in all&#8208;polymer photovoltaic blends pushes the efficiency up to 18.81%, with decent changes in maximal power point (MPP) tracked&#160;and thermal stress applied&#160;stability tests, where a new phenomenon in that donor aggregation is modulated by the acceptor component is focused on and carefully analyzed. The experience of ternary blend design from here is also expected&#160;to be instructive for other organic photovoltaics&#160;systems.








Abstract
Using two structurally similar polymer acceptors in constructing high&#8208;efficiency ternary all&#8208;polymer solar cells is a widely acknowledged strategy; however, the focus thus far has not been on how polymer acceptor(s) would tune the aggregation of polymer donors, and furthermore&#160;film morphology and device performance (efficiency and stability). Herein, it is reported that matching of the celebrity acceptor PY&#8208;IT and the donor PBQx&#8208;TCl results in enhanced H&#8208;aggregation in PBQx&#8208;TCl, which can be finely tuned by controlling the amount of the second acceptor PY&#8208;IV. Consequently, the efficiency&#8208;optimized PY&#8208;IV weight ratio (0.2/1.2) leads to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 18.81%, wherein light&#8208;illuminated operational stability is also enhanced along with well&#8208;protected thermal stability. Such enhancements in the efficiency and operational and thermal stabilities of solar cells can be attributed to morphology optimization and the desired glass transition temperature of the target active layer based on comprehensive characterization. In addition to being a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency case for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, these enhancements are also a successful attempt for using combined acceptors to tune donor aggregation toward optimal morphology, which provides a theoretical basis for the construction of other types of organic photovoltaics beyond all&#8208;polymer solar cells.

         <title>How Reproducible is the Synthesis of Zr&#8211;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks? An Interlaboratory Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It performed an interlaboratory study of the synthesis of the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) PCN&#8208;222 and PCN&#8208;224. Ten participants independently synthesized the two MOFs and the products are analyzed, primarily by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The success rates are low (one&#8208;three samples corresponding to a pure sample of the correct phase), thus highlighting the problems with irreproducibility in MOF synthesis. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly growing class of materials that offer great promise in various applications. However, the synthesis remains challenging: for example, a range of crystal structures can often be accessed from the same building blocks, which complicates the phase selectivity. Likewise, the high sensitivity to slight changes in synthesis conditions may cause reproducibility issues. This is crucial, as it hampers the research and commercialization of affected MOFs. Here, it presents the first&#8208;ever interlaboratory study of the synthetic reproducibility of two Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOFs, PCN&#8208;222 and PCN&#8208;224, to investigate the scope of this problem. For PCN&#8208;222, only one sample out of ten was&#160;phase pure and of the correct symmetry, while for PCN&#8208;224, three are phase pure, although none of these show the spatial linker order characteristic of PCN&#8208;224. Instead, these samples resemble dPCN&#8208;224 (disordered PCN&#8208;224), which has recently been reported. The variability in thermal behavior, defect content, and surface area of the synthesised samples are also studied. The results have important ramifications for field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their crystallization, by highlighting the synthetic challenges associated with a multi&#8208;variable synthesis space and flat energy landscapes characteristic of&#160;MOFs.

         <title>Accelerated Confined Mass Transfer of MoS2 1D Nanotube in Photo&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the high photogenerated electron&#8211;hole separation efficiency and the inherent mass transfer characteristics of MoS2 confined nanotubes, the photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery delivers a high power density (70&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and obtains a Li&#8211;O2 battery with excellent rate performance, which fully proves the universality of this confined structure to achieve simple, efficient and fast photogenerated carrier separation dynamics.








Abstract
Applying solar energy into energy storage battery systems is challenging in achieving green and sustainable development, however, the efficient progress of photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries is restricted by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes upon the photocathode. Herein, a 1D&#8208;ordered MoS2 nanotube (MoS2&#8208;ONT) with confined mass transfer can be used to extend the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, which is capable of overcoming the challenge of rapid recombination of electron and holes. The tubular confined space cannot only promote the orderly separation and migration of charge carriers but also realize the accumulation of charge and the rapid activation of oxygen molecules. The concave surface of MoS2&#8208;ONT can improve the carrier separation ability and prolong the carrier lifetime. Meanwhile, the ordered tubular confined space can effectively realize the rapid transfer of charge, ion, and oxygen. Under light irradiation, a fast oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of 70&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery is achieved, which is the highest value reported for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries. Significantly, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery based on MoS2&#8208;ONT also shows superior rate capability and other exciting battery performance. This work shows the universality of the confined carrier separation strategy in photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>A Microphase&#8208;Separated Design toward an All&#8208;Round Ionic Hydrogel with Discriminable and Anti&#8208;Disturbance Multisensory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;round elastic ionic hydrogel with microphase&#8208;separated structure is designed. This ionic hydrogel exhibits low Young's modulus, large stretchability, high resilience, unique strain&#8208;stiffening behavior, excellent fatigue tolerance, high ionic conductivity, and anti&#8208;freezing capability. These properties allow the ionic hydrogel to operate as a stretchable multimodal sensor that can detect and decouple multiple stimuli with high discriminability, sensitivity, and anti&#8208;disturbance ability.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic hydrogels with superior all&#8208;round properties that can detect multimodal sensations with excellent discriminability and robustness against external disturbances are highly required for artificial electronic skinapplications. However, some critical material parameters exhibit intrinsic tradeoffs with each other&#160;for most ionic hydrogels. Here, a microphase&#8208;separated hydrogel is demonstrated by combining three strategies: (1) using of a low crosslinker/monomer ratio to obtain highly entangled polymer chains as the first network; (2) the introduction of zwitterions into the first network; (3) the synthesis of an ultrasoft polyelectrolyte as the second network. This all&#8208;round elastic ionic hydrogel exhibits a low Young's modulus (&lt; 60&#160;kPa), large stretchability (&gt; 900%), high resilience (&gt; 95%), unique strain&#8208;stiffening behavior, excellent fatigue tolerance, high ionic conductivity (&gt; 2.0 S&#160;m&#8315;1), and anti&#8208;freezing capability, which have not been achieved before. These properties allow the ionic hydrogel to operate as a stretchable multimodal sensor that can detect and decouple multiple stimuli (temperature, pressure, and proximity) with excellent discriminability, high sensitivity, and strong sensing&#8208;robustness against strains or temperature perturbations. The ionic hydrogel sensor exhibits great potential for intelligent electronic skin applications such as reliable health monitoring and accurate object identification.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite into Subnanometer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphite is tailored into subnanometer graphene by an all&#8208;physical top&#8211;down method. Compared with graphene nanosheets and quantum sheets, subnanometer graphene demonstrates comprehensively and extremely enhanced performances in photoluminescence and nonlinear saturation absorption.








Abstract
Within the intersection of materials science and nanoscience/technology, extremely downsized (including quantum&#8208;sized and subnanometer&#8208;sized) materials attract increasing interest. However, the effective and controllable production of extremely downsized materials through physical strategies remains a great challenge. Herein, an all&#8208;physical top&#8211;down method for the production of sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene with completely broken lattice is reported. The graphene subnanometer materials (GSNs) with monolayer structures and lateral sizes of &#8776;0.5&#160;nm are obtained. Compared with their bulk, nanosheets, and quantum sheets, the intrinsic GSNs present extremely enhanced photoluminescence and nonlinear saturation absorption performances, as well as unique carrier behavior. The non&#8208;equilibrium states induced by the entirely exposed and broken, intrinsic lattices in sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene can be determinative to their extreme performances. This work shows the great potential of broken lattice and provides new insights toward subnanometer materials.

         <title>Robust, Sprayable, and Multifunctional Hydrogel Coating through a Polycation Reinforced (PCR) Surface Bridging Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycation&#8208;reinforced (PCR) surface bridging method is developed to achieve robust and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations provide superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma&#8208;treated substrates, leading to ultra&#8208;tough adhesion (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2), remarkable fatigue resistance, and facile construction. This PCR technique offers novel insight for the development of hydrogel hybrid devices.

The sprayable hydrogel coatings that can establish robust adhesion onto diverse materials and devices hold enormous potential; however, a significant challenge persists due to monomer hydration, which impedes even coverage during spraying and induces inadequate adhesion post&#8208;gelation. Herein, a polycation&#8208;reinforced (PCR) surface bridging strategy is presented to achieve tough and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations offer superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma&#8208;treated substrates, facilitating an effective spraying application. This PCR&#8208;based hydrogel coatings demonstrate tough adhesion performance to inert PTFE and silicone, including remarkable shear strength (161&#160;&#177;&#160;49&#160;kPa for PTFE), interfacial toughness (198&#160;&#177;&#160;27&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for PTFE), and notable tolerance to cyclic tension (10&#160;000 cycles, 200% strain, silicone). Meanwhile, this method can be applied to various hydrogel formulations, offering diverse functionalities, including underwater adhesion, lubrication, and drug delivery. Furthermore, the PCR concept enables the conformal construction of durable hydrogel coatings onto sophisticated medical devices like cardiovascular stents. Given its simplicity and adaptability, this approach paves an avenue for incorporating hydrogels onto solid surfaces and potentially promotes untapped applications.

&lt;p&gt;A polycation-reinforced (PCR) surface bridging method is developed to achieve robust and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations provide superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma-treated substrates, leading to ultra-tough adhesion (&amp;gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), remarkable fatigue resistance, and facile construction. This PCR technique offers novel insight for the development of hydrogel hybrid devices.

         <title>Mitochondrial Localized In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly Reprogramming Tumor Immune and Metabolic Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system is constructed to trigger pro&#8208;death mitophagy, which ultimately simultaneously activates the innate and adaptive immunities of tumor cells to benefit various cancer therapies, including radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This strategy highlights the spatiotemporal regulation of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly on subcellular organelles to determine cancer cell fate and enhance cancer therapy.








Abstract
The inherent immune and metabolic tumor microenvironment (TME) of most solid tumors adversely affect the antitumor efficacy of various treatments, which is an urgent issue to be solved in clinical cancer therapy. In this study, a mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system is constructed to remodel the TME by improving immunogenicity and disrupting the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells. The peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system can be pre&#8208;assembled into nanomicelles in vitro and form functional nanofibers on mitochondria through a cascade&#8208;responsive process involving reductive release, targeted enrichment, and in situ self&#8208;assembly. The organelle&#8208;specific in situ self&#8208;assemblyeffectively switches the role of mitophagy from pro&#8208;survival to pro&#8208;death, which finally induces intense endoplasmic reticulum stress and atypical type II immunogenic cell death. Disintegration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure also impedes the metabolic plasticity of tumor cells, which greatly promotes the immunosuppresive TME remodeling into an immunostimulatory TME. Ultimately, the mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system effectively suppresses tumor metastases, and converts cold tumors into hot tumors with enhanced sensitivity to radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This study offers a universal strategy for spatiotemporally controlling supramolecular self&#8208;assembly on sub&#8208;organelles to determine cancer cell fate and enhance cancer therapy.

Multiyolk&#8211;Shell Nanocoils
Article number 2312214 by Young Keun Kim and co&#8208;workers presents the synthesis strategy of eight distinct nanocoils featuring varied shapes and compositions. These nanocoils are derived from a bimetallic alloy nanocoil template through meticulous control of electrochemical conditions. The resultant multiyolk&#8208;shell nanocoil (mYSNC), synthesized within an electrochemically programmed aqueous solution, manifests a distinctive and unprecedented structural configuration. The mYSNCs demonstrate exceptional photocatalytic efficiency in water purification, effecting the decomposition of organic matter in water under light irradiation. The unique attributes of its structure render it a hitherto unobserved and promising candidate for applications in advanced photocatalysis.

Flexible Electronics
A minimalistic route is presented to additively manufacture, via laser printing, high&#8208;performing (power factor over 1500 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2) and extremely flexible Bi2Te3 films on plastic foil. This route facilitates large&#8208;area fabrication and complex maskless patterning without organic binders, and leads to the innovative concept of &#8220;cuttable power arrays&#8221; that enables the fast customization of thermoelectric generators for diverse applications. More details can be found in article number 2307945 by Francisco Molina&#8208;Lopez and co&#8208;workers.

3D Tiled Auxetic Metamaterial
In article number 2309604 by Tiantian Li and Yaning Li, a strategy of designing a new family of 3D auxetic tiled metamaterials based on 3D space filling tessellation is demonstrated. The new designs show remarkable combined unusual mechanical properties including auxeticity, high resilience, large mechanical hysteresis, ideal isotropy, and a unique coupled auxeticity and twisting behavior, as rarely seen in existing 3D mechanical metamaterials.

Nanoengineered RBCs
In article number 2310306, Wen Yue, Xue&#8208;Tao Pei, Jun&#8208;Nian Zhou, and co&#8208;workers design nanoengineered red blood cells (RBCs) to block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 cell entry in the lungs, regardless of virus variations. The nano&#8208;micro system is modular (anti&#8208;receptor antibody + drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers + RBCs), and the findings will benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host&#8208;cell&#8208;protecting antiviral therapies.

Ultraflexible Wireless Imager
In article number 2309864, Rei Kawabata, Teppei Araki, Yukio Kawano, Tsuyoshi Sekitani, and co&#8208;workers report an ultrathin imager that expands the possibility of non&#8208;destructive testing methods such as &#8220;non&#8208;collecting&#8221; liquid quality evaluation and &#8220;non&#8208;contact&#8221; imaging through wireless communication systems. An active matrix of carbon nanotube photodetectors and organic transistors within the imager demonstrates high sensitivity across a wide infrared range, spanning from near&#8208;infrared to terahertz wavelengths, and is expected to be applied to wearable devices and portable imaging devices.

Switchable Design Strategy
This cover art describes a novel switchable design strategy aimed at enhancing the intrinsic redox potentials of quinones by restoring conjugated but nonaromatic backbone architecture. This establishes the recovery of backbone conjugation and optimal utilization of the inductive effect of electronic localization near electron&#8208;withdrawing areas and suppressing the resonance effect of electronic delocalization in the switched quinones. More details can be found in article number 2311155 by Ki Chul Kim and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Solid Interfaces for the Garnet Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, including the interior interfaces, garnet/anode, and garnet/cathode interfaces are presented separately. The strategies of Li dendrite suppression, interfacial chemical/electrochemical/mechanical stabilizations, the rational design of the interphases, as well as effective stacking methods of the garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are also summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) have attracted extensive interests due to the advantages in developing secondary batteries with high energy density and outstanding safety. Possessing high ionic conductivity and the lowest reduction potential among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SSEs, the garnet type SSE is one of the most promising candidates to achieve high performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs). However, the elastic modulus of the garnet electrolyte leads to deteriorated interfacial contacts, and the increasing in electronic conduction at either anode/garnet interface or grain boundary results in Li dendrite growth. Here, recent developments of the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, including the strategies of Li dendrite suppression and interfacial chemical/electrochemical/mechanical stabilizations are presented. A new viewpoint of the double edges of interfacial lithiophobicity is proposed, and the rational design of the interphases, as well as effective stacking methods of the garnet&#8208;based SSLBs are summarized. Moreover, practical roles of the garnet electrolyte in SSLB industry are also discussed. This work delivers insights into the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, which provides not only the promotion of the garnet&#8208;based SSLBs, but also a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial stabilization for the whole SSE family.

         <title>Resistive Memory Devices at the Thinnest Limit: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 2D monolayer materials as dielectric or channel layers, resistive memory technology can be in principles scaled down to its thinnest limits. This review is aimed to systematically evaluate the potential and challenges of utilizing the thinnest advanced materials for memristor and memtransistor&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
The Si&#8208;based integrated circuits industry has been developing for more than half a century, by focusing on the scaling&#8208;down of transistor. However, the miniaturization of transistors will soon reach its physical limits, thereby requiring novel material and device technologies. Resistive memory is a promising candidate for in&#8208;memory computing and energy&#8208;efficient synaptic devices that can satisfy the computational demands of the future applications. However, poor cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle and device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformities hinder its mass production. 2D materials, as a new type of semiconductor, is successfully employed in various micro/nanoelectronic devices and have the potential to drive future innovation in resistive memory technology. This review evaluates the potential of using the thinnest advanced materials, that is, monolayer 2D materials, for memristor or memtransistor applications, including resistive switching behavior and atomic mechanism, high&#8208;frequency device performances, and in&#8208;memory computing/neuromorphic computing applications. The scaling&#8208;down advantages of promising monolayer 2D materials including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and hexagonal boron nitride are presented. Finally, the technical challenges of these atomic devices for practical applications are elaborately discussed. The study of monolayer&#8208;2D&#8208;material&#8208;based resistive memory is expected to play a positive role in the exploration of beyond&#8208;Si electronic technologies.

         <title>Recent Advances in Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Metal&#8211;Organic Hybrids: Structures, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of metal&#8211;organic hybrids with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is presented. Metal&#8211;organic hybrids include coordination polymers, ionic crystals, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, and so on. The crystal structures, RTP properties, and applications of metal&#8211;organic hybrids are discussed in detail. The prospects of RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids are discussed. This review lays the foundation of developing RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic hybrid (MOH) materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have drawn attention in recent years due to their superior RTP properties of high phosphorescence efficiency and ultralong emission lifetime. Great achievement has been realized in developing MOH materials with high&#8208;performance RTP, but a systematic study on MOH materials with RTP feature is lacking. This review highlights recent advances in metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials. The molecular packing, the photophysical properties, and their applications of metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials are discussed in detail. Metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials can be divided into six parts: coordination polymers, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), metal&#8208;halide hybrids, organic ionic crystals, organic ionic polymers, and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites. These RTP materials have been successfully applied in time&#8208;resolved data encryption, fingerprint recognition, information logic gates, X&#8208;ray imaging, and photomemory. This review not only provides the basic principles of designing RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids, but also propounds the future research prospects of RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids. This review offers many effective strategies for developing metal&#8211;organic hybrids with excellent RTP properties, thus satisfying practical applications.

         <title>Advancing Mycotoxin Detection in Food and Feed: Novel Insights from Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of nanomaterial fabrication techniques including, the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of metallic, core&#8211;shell and magnetic nanoparticles and top&#8208;down approaches including, lithographic, nonlithographic, and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: MXenes and graphene are presented for the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;based detection of mycotoxins in food and feed, with an emphasis on current challenges and future prospects.








Abstract
The implementation of low&#8208;cost and rapid technologies for the on&#8208;site detection of mycotoxin&#8208;contaminated crops is a promising solution to address the growing concerns of the agri&#8208;food industry. Recently, there have been significant developments in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for the direct detection of mycotoxins in food and feed. This review provides an overview of the most recent advancements in the utilization of SERS through the successful fabrication of novel nanostructured materials. Various bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches have demonstrated their potential in improving sensitivity, while many applications exploit the immobilization of recognition elements and molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) to enhance specificity and reproducibility in complex matrices. Therefore, the design and fabrication of nanomaterials is of utmost importance and are presented herein. This paper uncovers that limited studies establish detection limits&#160;or conduct validation using naturally contaminated samples. One decade on, SERS is still lacking significant progress and there is a disconnect between the technology, the European regulatory limits, and the intended end&#8208;user. Ongoing challenges and potential solutions are discussed including nanofabrication, molecular binders, and data analytics. Recommendations to assay design, portability, and substrate stability are made to help improve the potential and feasibility of SERS for future on&#8208;site agri&#8208;food applications.

Various bottom-up and top-down approaches have demonstrated their potential in improving sensitivity, while many applications exploit the immobilization of recognition elements and molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) to enhance specificity and reproducibility in complex matrices. Therefore, the design and fabrication of nanomaterials is of utmost importance and are presented herein. This paper uncovers that limited studies establish detection limits&#160;or conduct validation using naturally contaminated samples. One decade on, SERS is still lacking significant progress and there is a disconnect between the technology, the European regulatory limits, and the intended end-user. Ongoing challenges and potential solutions are discussed including nanofabrication, molecular binders, and data analytics. Recommendations to assay design, portability, and substrate stability are made to help improve the potential and feasibility of SERS for future on-site agri-food applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Schematic illustration of in vivo cell reprogramming platforms for in situ cell therapy. Following infusion into the patients, the nanoparticles directly transfer the transgene cargos (plasmid DNA, mRNA, etc.) into the cell of interest (T lymphocytes, macrophages, etc.) and transiently program the targeted cells to express transgenes inside the body.








Abstract
In the past decade, adoptive cell therapy with chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cells has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the complexity and high costs involved in manufacturing current adoptive cell therapy greatly inhibit its widespread availability and access. To address this, in situ cell therapy, which directly reprograms immune cells inside the body, has recently been developed as a promising alternative. Here, an overview of the recent progress in the development of synthetic nanomaterials is provided to deliver plasmid DNA or mRNA for in situ reprogramming of T cells and macrophages, focusing especially on in situ CAR therapies. Also, the main challenges for in situ immune cell reprogramming are discussed and some approaches to overcome these barriers to fulfill the clinical applications are proposed.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in creating polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;structured materials with a unique focus on their molecular fundamentals and electrocatalytic roles in energy conversion have been systematically summarized. The structures, synthesis, characterizations, electrocatalytic merits, and recent breakthroughs of POM molecules, POMs&#8208;based structures, and POMs&#8208;derived electrocatalysts have been discussed.

Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of molecular metal oxide cluster with unique physical&#8211;chemical properties, have made essential contributions to creating efficient and robust electrocatalysts in renewable energy systems. Due to the fundamental advantages of POMs, such as the diversity of molecular structures and large numbers of redox active sites, numerous efforts have been devoted to extending their application areas. Up to now, various strategies of assembling POM molecules into superstructures, supporting POMs on heterogeneous substrates, and POMs&#8208;derived metal compounds have been developed for synthesizing electrocatalysts. From a multidisciplinary perspective, the latest advances in creating POM&#8208;structured materials with a unique focus on their molecular fundamentals, electrocatalytic roles, and the recent breakthroughs of POMs and POM&#8208;derived electrocatalysts, are systematically summarized. Notably, this paper focuses on exposing the current states, essences, and mechanisms of how POM&#8208;structured materials influence their electrocatalytic activities and discloses the critical requirements for future developments. The future challenges, objectives, comparisons, and perspectives for creating POM&#8208;structured materials are also systematically discussed. It is anticipated that this review will offer a substantial impact on stimulating interdisciplinary efforts for the prosperities and widespread utilizations of POM&#8208;structured materials in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Facilitating Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Orbital Hybridization for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Marvelous Air Stability, Controllable High Voltage, and Anion Redox Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on orbital hybridization theory, the challenges of layered oxide cathodes in terms of air stability, high voltage, anion redox chemistry, and improving the intrinsic characteristics through interactions between the 3d/4d transition metal and the O 2p atomic orbitals are summarized. This strategy of modulating orbitals hybridization will promote the development of sodium layered oxide cathodes and its commercialization process.








Abstract
Layered oxides have become the research focus of cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the low cost, simple synthesis process, and high specific capacity. However, the poor air stability, unstable phase structure under high voltage, and slow anionic redox kinetics hinder their commercial application. In recent years, the concept of manipulating orbital hybridization has been proposed to simultaneously regulate the microelectronic structure and modify the surface chemistry environment intrinsically. In this review, the hybridization modes between atoms in 3d/4d transition metal (TM) orbitals and O 2p orbitals near the region of the Fermi energy level (EF) are summarized based on orbital hybridization theory and first&#8208;principles calculations as well as various sophisticated characterizations. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms are explored from macro&#8208;scale to micro&#8208;scale, including enhancing air stability, modulating high working voltage, and stabilizing anionic redox chemistry. Meanwhile, the origin, formation conditions, and different types of orbital hybridization, as well as its application in layered oxide cathodes are presented, which provide insights into the design and preparation of cathode materials. Ultimately, the main challenges in the development of orbital hybridization and its potential for the production application are also discussed, pointing out the route for high&#8208;performance practical sodium layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Toward the Commercialization of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first introduces the current status of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules and their potential applications. Then it identifies critical challenges in commercialization and corresponding solutions, including strategies for power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement over large areas, stability improvements, toxicity reduction, and so on. Finally, it includes some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future.








Abstract
Perovskite (PVSK) photovoltaic (PV) devices are undergoing rapid development and have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% at the cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light&#8208;related stability. Moreover, the solution&#8208;process nature makes the fabrication process of perovskite photovoltaic devices feasible and compatible with some mature high&#8208;volume manufacturing techniques. All these features render perovskite solar modules (PSMs) suitable for terawatt&#8208;scale energy production with a low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In this review, the current status of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules and their potential applications are first introduced. Then critical challenges are identified in their commercialization and propose the corresponding solutions, including developing strategies to realize high&#8208;quality films over a large area to further improve power conversion efficiency and stability to meet the commercial demands. Finally, some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future, mainly focusing on further dealing with toxicity and recycling of the whole device, and the attainment of highly efficient perovskite&#8208;based tandem modules, which can reduce the environmental impact and accelerate the LCOE reduction are put forwarded.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Drug Coordination Nanoparticles and Hydrogels for Enhanced Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Drug delivery is a key component of nanomedicine, and conventional delivery relies on the adsorption or encapsulation of drug molecules to a nanomaterial. Many delivery vehicles contain metal ions such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXene and noble metal nanoparticles. These materials have a high metal content and pose potential long&#8208;term toxicity concerns leading to difficulties for clinical approval. In this review, we summarize recent developments in the use of drug molecules as ligands for metal coordination forming various nanomaterials and soft materials. In these cases, the drug&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio is much higher than conventional adsorption&#8208;based strategies. The drug molecules are divided into small&#8208;molecule drugs, nucleic acids, and proteins. The formed hybrid materials mainly include nanoparticles and hydrogels, upon which targeting ligands can be grafted to improve efficacy and further decrease toxicity. The application of these materials for addressing cancer, viral infection, bacterial infection inflammatory bowel disease, and bone diseases is reviewed. In the end, some future directions are discussed from fundamental research, materials science, and medicine.

         <title>A Rhombic 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention as promising electroactive materials for energy storage. However, their further applications have been hindered by low capacity, limited cycling life, and underutilization of the active sites. Herein, we introduce Cu&#8208;TBA (TBA = octahydroxyl tetrabenzoanthracene) with large conjugation units (narrow energy gap) and a unique rhombus topology as the cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Notably, Cu&#8208;TBA with a rhombus topology exhibits a high specific surface area (613 m2 g&#8722;1) and metallic band structure. Additionally, Cu&#8208;TBA outperforms its hexagonal counterpart, Cu&#8208;HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxyphenanthrene), demonstrating superior reversible capacity (153.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and outstanding cyclability with minimal capacity decay even after 3,000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work elucidates a new strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of 2D c&#8208;MOFs cathode materials by narrowing the energy gap of organic linkers, effectively expanding the utilization of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for SIBs.

         <title>Elucidation of Spatial Cooperativity in Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy by a Sequential Dual&#8208;pH&#8208;Responsive Drug Delivery System</title>

Abstract
Combining immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy through nanotechnology is promising in terms of safety and efficacy. However, the distinct subcellular distribution of each ingredient's action site makes it challenging to acquire an optimal synergism. Herein, a dual&#8208;pH responsive hybrid polymeric micelle system, HNP(&#945;PDL16.9,Dox5.3), is constructed as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the spatial cooperativity in chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. HNP retains the inherent pH&#8208;transition of each polymer, with stepwise disassembly under discrete pH thresholds. Within weakly acidic extracellular tumor environment, &#945;PDL1 is first released to block the checkpoint on cell membranes. The remaining intact Doxorubicin&#8208;loaded micelle NP(Dox)5.3 displays significant tropism toward tumor cells and releases Dox upon lysosomal pH for efficient tumor immunogenic cell death without immune toxicity. This sequential&#8208;released pattern boosts DC activation and primes CD8+ T cells, leading to enhanced therapeutic performance than single agent or an inverse&#8208;ordered combination in multiple murine tumor models. Using HNP, we identify the indispensable role of conventional type 1 DC (cDC1) in chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. A co&#8208;signature of cDC1 and CD8 correlates with cancer patient survival after neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in clinic. This study highlights the spatial cooperativity of chemo&#8208; and immuno&#8208;agents in immunoregulation, and provides insights into the rational design of drug combination for future nanotherapeutics development.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt; 25% Efficiency: Unveiling the Hidden Bottom Surface of Perovskite Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Surface Engineering and the effective management of lead iodide (PbI2) are pivotal for improving the performance of two&#8208;step perovskite solar cells. While significant efforts have been devoted to the conversion process of PbI2 into perovskite and top surface engineering of perovskite layer with remarkable progress, the exploration of residual PbI2 clusters and the hidden bottom surface on perovskite layer have been limited. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the often overlooked PbI2 residual and its detailed impact on device performance. Importantly, oversized residual PbI2 clusters have been observed to accumulate at the bottom surface of perovskite, significantly hindering the device performance. To address this issue, we develop a new strategy involving 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate (BMIMAc) ionic liquid (IL) additives and find that both the cations and the anions in ILs can interact with the perovskite components, thereby regulating the crystallization process and diminishing the residue PbI2 clusters as well as filling vacancies. Interestingly, the introduction of BMIMAc ILs induces the formation of a uniform porous PbI2 film, facilitating better penetration of the second&#8208;step organic salt and fostering a more extensive interaction between PbI2 and the organic salt. Surprisingly, the oversized residual PbI2 clusters at the bottom surface of the perovskite layer completely diminish, in contrast to the pristine sample. Furthermore, the incorporation of ILs into PbI2 efficiently slows down the perovskite crystallization process by binding with PbI2, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and reduced PbI2 content. In addition, advanced depth analysis techniques including depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) and bottom thinning technology are employed for a comprehensive understanding of the reduction in residual PbI2 following the IL treatment. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and precise regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a power conversion efficiencie (PCE) of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Ordered Perovskite Structure with Functional Units for High Performance and Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite films based on the concept of ordered structures with functional units (OSFU) are constructed. With this structure, the ion migration within the active layer is successfully suppressed. Solar cells show negligible hysteresis and improved stability, including continuous operational and light/dark cycling tests.








Abstract
Ion migration is one of the most critical challenges that affects the stability of metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current arsenal of available strategies for solving this issue is limited. Here, novel perovskite active layers following the concept of ordered structures with functional units (OSFU) to intrinsically suppress ion migration, in which a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite layer is deposited by vapor deposition for light absorption and a 2D layer is deposited by solution process for ion inhibition, are constructed. As a promising result, the activation energy of ion migration increases from 0.36 eV for the conventional perovskite to 0.54 eV for the OSFU perovskite. These devices exhibit substantially enhanced operational stability in comparison with the conventional ones, retaining &gt;85% of their initial efficiencies after 1200&#8201;h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1. Moreover, the OSFU devices show negligible fatigue behavior with a robust performance under light/dark cycling aging test (ISOS&#8208;LC&#8208;1 protocol), which demonstrates the promising application of functional motif theory in this field.

         <title>Efficient Delivery of Lomitapide using Hybrid Membrane&#8208;Coated Tetrahedral DNA Nanostructures for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a biomimetic nanodrug delivery system, RFA nanoparticles is constructed, which takes into account long&#8208;term circulation within the bloodstream and drug&#8208;carrying function, and can combine active targeting and immune escape to deliver lomitapide stably targeted to the cancer cells behind the blood&#8208;brain barrier, which achieved efficient, stable and safe drug therapy for glioblastoma.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and prevalent primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Traditional chemotherapy has poor therapeutic effects and significant side effects due to drug resistance, the natural blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), and nonspecific distribution, leading to a lack of clinically effective therapeutic drugs. Here, 1430 small molecule compounds are screened based on a high&#8208;throughput drug screening platform and a novel anti&#8208;GBM drug, lomitapide (LMP) is obtained. Furthermore, a bionic nanodrug delivery system (RFA NPs) actively targeting GBM is constructed, which mainly consists of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (tFNA NPs) loaded with LMP as the core and a folate&#8208;modified erythrocyte&#8211;cancer cell&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (FRUR) as the shell. FRUR camouflage conferred unique features on tFNA NPs, including excellent biocompatibility, improved pharmacokinetic profile, efficient BBB permeability, and tumor targeting ability. The results show that the LMP RFA NPs exhibited superior and specific anti&#8208;GBM activities, reduced off&#8208;target drug delivery, prolonged lifespan, and has negligible side effects in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study combines high&#8208;throughput drug screening with biomimetic nanodrug delivery system technology to provide a theoretical and practical basis for drug development and the optimization of clinical treatment strategies for GBM treatment.

Here, 1430 small molecule compounds are screened based on a high-throughput drug screening platform and a novel anti-GBM drug, lomitapide (LMP) is obtained. Furthermore, a bionic nanodrug delivery system (RFA NPs) actively targeting GBM is constructed, which mainly consists of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (tFNA NPs) loaded with LMP as the core and a folate-modified erythrocyte&#8211;cancer cell&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (FRUR) as the shell. FRUR camouflage conferred unique features on tFNA NPs, including excellent biocompatibility, improved pharmacokinetic profile, efficient BBB permeability, and tumor targeting ability. The results show that the LMP RFA NPs exhibited superior and specific anti-GBM activities, reduced off-target drug delivery, prolonged lifespan, and has negligible side effects in tumor-bearing mice. This study combines high-throughput drug screening with biomimetic nanodrug delivery system technology to provide a theoretical and practical basis for drug development and the optimization of clinical treatment strategies for GBM treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Conventional Charge Density Wave for Strongly Enhanced 2D Superconductivity in 1H&#8208;TaS2 Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3 &#215; 3 charge density wave (CDW) order and enhanced 2D Ising superconductivity (SC) are demonstrated in (SnS)1.15TaS2 van der Waals superlattices, which exhibit monolayer&#8208;like electronic characteristics. The observed low&#8208;lying sulfur p band rearrangement implies a novel CDW driving force, providing new insights into the long&#8208;debated CDW order and 2D SC in monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers offer a fertile platform for exploring unconventional Ising superconductivity (SC) and charge density waves (CDWs). However, the vulnerability of isolated monolayers to structural disorder and environmental oxidation often degrade their electronic coherence. Herein, an alternative approach is reported for fabricating stable and intrinsic monolayers of 1H&#8208;TaS2 sandwiched between SnS blocks in a (SnS)1.15TaS2 van der Waals (vdW) superlattice. The SnS block layers not only decouple individual 1H&#8208;TaS2 sublayers to endow them with monolayer&#8208;like electronic characteristics, but also protect the 1H&#8208;TaS2 layers from electronic degradation. The results reveal the characteristic 3 &#215; 3 CDW order in 1H&#8208;TaS2 sublayers associated with electronic rearrangement in the low&#8208;lying sulfur p band, which uncovers a previously undiscovered CDW mechanism rather than the conventional Fermi surface&#8208;related framework. Additionally, the (SnS)1.15TaS2 superlattice exhibits a strongly enhanced Ising&#8208;like SC with a layer&#8208;independent Tc of &#8776;3.0 K, comparable to that of the isolated monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 sample, presumably attributed to their monolayer&#8208;like characteristics and retained Fermi states. These results provide new insights into the long&#8208;debated CDW order and enhanced SC of monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2, establishing bulk vdW superlattices as promising platforms for investigating exotic collective quantum phases in the 2D limit.

         <title>Assembly of Interfacial Polyelectrolyte Complexation Fibers with Mineralization Gradient for Physiologically&#8208;Inspired Ligament Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a physiologically&#8208;inspired ligament regeneration with biomimetic hierarchical architecture, viscoelasticity, and enthesis&#8208;like mineralization gradient. Through these advancements, this research aims at improving clinical outcomes, facilitating patient recovery, and provide a long&#8208;lasting and effective solution for ligament injuries.








Abstract
Current synthetic grafts for ligament rupture repair often fail to integrate well with the surrounding biological tissue, leading to complications such as graft wear, fatigue, and subsequent re&#8208;rupture. To address this medical challenge, this study aims at advancing the development of a biological ligament through the integration of physiologically&#8208;inspired principles and tissue engineering strategies. In this study, interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation (IPC) spinning technique, along with a custom&#8208;designed collection system, to fabricate a hierarchical scaffold mimicking native ligament structure, is utilized. To emulate the bone&#8208;ligament interface and alleviate stress concentration, a hydroxyapatite (HAp) mineral gradient is strategically introduced near both ends of the scaffold to enhance interface integration and diminish the risk of avulsion rupture. Biomimetic viscoelasticity is successfully displayed to provide similar mechanical support to native ligamentous tissue under physiological conditions. By introducing the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and conducting mesenchymal stem cells transplantation, the regenerative potential of the synthetic ligament is significantly amplified. This pioneering study offers a multifaceted solution combining biomimetic materials, regenerative therapies, and advanced techniques to potentially transform ligament rupture treatment.

         <title>Constructing Bipolar Dual&#8208;Active Sites through High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Induced Electric Dipole Transition for Decoupling Oxygen Redox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It remains a significant challenge to construct active sites to break the trade&#8208;off between oxidation and reduction processes occurring in battery cathodes with conversion mechanism, especially for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) involved in the Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Here, we propose using a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;driven electric dipole transition strategy to activate and stabilize the tetrahedral sites, while enhancing the activity of octahedral sites through orbital hybridization in a FeCoNiMnCrO spinel oxide, thus constructing bipolar dual&#8208;active sites with high&#8208;low valence states, which can effectively decouple ORR/OER. The FeCoNiMnCrO high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide (HESO) with severe lattice distortion, exhibits a strong 1s&#8594;4s electric dipole transition and intense t2g(Co)/eg(Ni)&#8208;2p(OL) orbital hybridization that regulates the electronic descriptors, eg and t2g, which leads to the formation of low&#8208;valence Co tetrahedral sites (Coth) and high&#8208;valence Ni octahedral sites (Nioh), resulting in a higher half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V on Coth sites and a lower overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 on Nioh sites as well as a superior performance of ZABs compared to low/mild entropy spinel oxides (L/MESO). Therefore, entropy engineering presents a distinctive approach for designing catalytic sites by inducing novel electromagnetic properties in materials across various electrocatalytic reactions, particularly for decoupling systems.

         <title>Giant Modulation of Refractive Index from Picoscale Atomic Displacements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At room temperature, quasi&#8211;1D chalcogenide crystal BaTiS3 shows structural disorder due to off&#8211;centering Ti displacements along the ab&#8211;plane that is perpendicular to the long axis. These disordered Ti displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab&#8211;plane and result in a giant enhancement of optical anisotropy. Thus, structural disorder provides a new degree&#8211;of&#8211;freedom for light manipulation in photonic applications.








Abstract
It is shown that structural disorder&#8212;in the form of anisotropic, picoscale atomic displacements&#8212;modulates the refractive index tensor and results in the giant optical anisotropy observed in BaTiS3, a quasi&#8208;1D hexagonal chalcogenide. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal the presence of antipolar displacements of Ti atoms within adjacent TiS6 chains along the c&#8208;axis, and threefold degenerate Ti displacements in the a&#8211;b plane. 47/49Ti solid&#8208;state NMR provides additional evidence for those Ti displacements in the form of a three&#8208;horned NMR lineshape resulting from a low symmetry local environment around Ti atoms. Scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the globally disordered Ti a&#8211;b plane displacements and find them to be ordered locally over a few unit cells. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the Ti a&#8211;b plane displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab&#8208;plane, while having minimal impact on the refractive index along the chain direction, thus resulting in a giant enhancement in the optical anisotropy. By showing a strong connection between structural disorder with picoscale displacements and the optical response in BaTiS3, this study opens a pathway for designing optical materials with high refractive index and functionalities such as large optical anisotropy and nonlinearity.

         <title>Enhancing the Thermoelectric Properties of Conjugated Polymers by Suppressing Dopant&#8208;Induced Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By creating well&#8208;defined molecular cavities in P3HT&#8208;based random copolymers, the dopant&#8208;induced disorder is suppressed upon IEx&#8208;doing of the polymers, leading to optimized molecular packing with minimized structural disorder, resulting in electrical conductivities in excess of 400&#160;S cm&#8722;1 and power factor of &gt;16&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, ranking them the highest ever reports for P3HT&#8208;based polymers without chain alignment.








Abstract
Doping is a crucial strategy to enhance the performance of various organic electronic devices. However, in many cases, the random distribution of dopants in conjugated polymers leads to the disruption of the polymer microstructure, severely constraining the achievable performance of electronic devices. Here, it is shown that by ion&#8208;exchange doping polythiophene&#8208;based P[(3HT)1&#8208;x&#8208;stat&#8208;(T)x] (x&#160;=&#160;0 (P1), 0.12 (P2), 0.24 (P3), and 0.36 (P4)), remarkably high electrical conductivity of &gt;400&#160;S cm&#8722;1 and power factor of &gt;16&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 are achieved for the random copolymer P3, ranking it among highest ever reported for unaligned P3HT&#8208;based films, significantly higher than that of P1 (&lt;40&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, &lt;4&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2). Although both polymers exhibit comparable field&#8208;effect transistor hole mobilities of &#8776;0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 in the pristine state, after doping, Hall effect measurements indicate that P3 exhibits a large Hall mobility up to 1.2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, significantly outperforming that of P1 (0.06&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). GIWAXS measurement determines that the in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance of doped P3 is 3.44&#160;&#197;, distinctly shorter than that of doped P1 (3.68&#160;&#197;). These findings contribute to resolving the long&#8208;standing dopant&#8208;induced&#8208;disorder issues in P3HT and serve as an example for achieving fast charge transport in highly doped polymers for efficient electronics.

         <title>Thermal Radiation Annealing for Overcoming Processing Temperature Limitation of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Common polymeric conductive electrodes, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coated with indium tin oxide, face a major challenge of their low processing&#8208;temperature limits, attributed to PET's low glass transition temperature (Tg of 70&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C). This limitation significantly narrows the scope of material selection, limits the processing techniques applicable to the low Tg, and hinders the ripened technology transfer from glass substrates to them. Addressing the temperature constraints of the flexible substrates is impactful yet underexplored, with broader implications for fields beyond photovoltaics. Here we introduce a new thermal radiation annealing methodology to address this issue. By applying above Tg radiation annealing in conjunction with thermoelectric cooling, we successfully create highly ordered molecular packing on PET substrates, which are exclusively unachievable due to PET's low thermal tolerance. As a result, in the context of perovskite solar cells, this approach enables the circumvention of high&#8208;temperature annealing limitations of PET substrates, leading to a remarkable flexible device efficiency of 22.61% and a record fill factor of 83.42%. This approach proves especially advantageous for advancing the field of flexible optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Microstrain&#8208;Stimulated Elastico&#8208;Mechanoluminescence with Dual&#8208;Mode Stress Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Elastico&#8208;mechanoluminescence technology has shown significant application prospects in stress sensing, artificial skin, remote interaction, and other research areas. Its progress mainly lies in realizing stress visualization and two&#8208;dimensional or even three&#8208;dimensional stress&#8208;sensing effects using a passive sensing mode. However, the widespread promotion of mechanoluminescence (ML) technology has been hindered by issues such as high stress or strain thresholds and a single sensing mode based on luminous intensity. In this study, a highly efficient green&#8208;emitting ML with dual mode stress&#8208;sensing characteristics driven by micro&#8208;scale strain was developed using LiTaO3:Tb3+. In addition to single&#8208;mode sensing based on the luminous intensity, the self&#8208;defined parameter (Q) was also introduced as a dual&#8208;mode factor for sensing the stress velocity. Impressively, the fabricated LiTaO3:Tb3+ film is capable of generating discernible ML signals even when supplied with strains as low as 500 &#956;st. This is the current the minimum strain value that can drive green&#8208;emitting ML. Our study offers an ideal photonic platform for exploring the potential applications of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped elastico&#8208;ML materials in remote interaction devices, high&#8208;precision stress sensors, and single&#8208;molecule biological imaging.

         <title>Towards Ultrahigh Rate and Cycling Performance of Cathode Materials of Sodium Ion Battery by Introducing a Bicontinuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising candidates expected to complement lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and diversify the battery market. However, the exploitation of cathode materials with high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability for SIBs has remained one of the major challenges. To this end, we demonstrated an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) were selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibited excellent rate capability (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.5 A g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycling life (&gt; 3000 circulations at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA&#8208;based cathode materials. This study opens a new avenue for boosting sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in electrodes of rechargeable batteries, and also provides a new paradigm for solving the dilemma that electrodes&#8217; failure due to high&#8208;stress concentration upon ion storage.

         <title>Excited&#8208;state Engineering Enables Efficient Deep&#8208;blue Light&#8208;emitting Diodes Exhibiting BT.2020 Color Gamut</title>

Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can convert non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons into emissive singlet states through a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Therefore, they have tremendous potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, with the development of ultra&#8208;high definition 4K/8K display technologies, designing efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF materials to achieve the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates fulfilling BT.2020 remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose an effective approach to design deep&#8208;blue TADF molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporation of multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting TADF molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission at 414&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#160;nm, together with a thousand&#8208;fold increase in RISC rate. OLEDs based on our champion material achieved a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% with CIE coordinates of (0.163, 0.046), approaching the coordinates of the BT.2020 blue standard. Moreover, TADF&#8208;assisted fluorescence devices employing our designed material as a sensitizer exhibited an exceptional EQE of 33.1%. Our work thus provides a blueprint for future development of efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters, representing an important milestone towards meeting the blue color gamut standard of BT.2020.

         <title>Revealing the Indispensable Role of In&#8208;Situ Electrochemically Reconstructed Mn(II)/Mn(III) in Improving the Performance of Lithium&#8208;Carbon Dioxide Batteries</title>

Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are regarded as promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy conversion and storage devices, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CORR/COER) kinetics. Due to the various crystal structures and unique electronic configuration, Mn&#8208;based cathode catalysts have shown considerable competition to facilitate CORR/COER. However, the specific active sites and regulation principle of Mn&#8208;based catalysts remain ambiguous and limited. Herein, we design novel Mn dual&#8208;active sites supported on N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (MOC@NCNF) and conduct a comprehensive investigation into the underlying relationship between different Mn active sites and their electrochemical performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Impressively, we find that owing to the in&#8208;situ generation and stable existence of Mn(III), MOC undergoes obvious electrochemical reconstruction during battery cycling. Moreover, a series of characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the different electronic configurations and coordination environments of Mn(II) and Mn(III) are conducive to promoting CORR and COER, respectively. Benefiting from such a modulating behavior, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries deliver a high full discharge capacity of 10.31 mAh cm&#8722;2, and ultra&#8208;long cycle life (327 cycles/1308&#160;h). This fundamental understanding of MOC reconstruction and the electrocatalytic mechanisms provides a new perspective for designing high&#8208;performance multivalent Mn&#8208;integrated hybrid catalysts for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Mitigating the Overheat of Stretchable Electronic Devices via High&#8208;Enthalpy Thermal Dissipation of Hydrogel Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The practical application of flexible and stretchable electronics is significantly influenced by their thermal and chemical stability. Elastomer substrates and encapsulation, due to their soft polymer chains and high surface&#8208;area&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, are particularly susceptible to high temperatures and flame. Excessive heat poses a severe threat of damage and decomposition to these elastomers. By leveraging water as a high enthalpy dissipating agent, here a hydrogel encapsulation strategy is proposed to enhance the flame retardancy and thermal stability of stretchable electronics. The hydrogel&#8208;based encapsulation provides thermal protection against flames for more than 10 seconds through the evaporation of water. Furthermore, the stretchability and functions automatically recover by absorbing air moisture. The incorporation of hydrogel encapsulation enables stretchable electronics to maintain their functions and perform complex tasks, such as fire saving in soft robotics and integrated electronics sensing. With high enthalpy heat dissipation, encapsulated soft electronic devices are effectively shielded and retain their full functionality. This strategy offers a universal method for flame retardant encapsulation of stretchable electronic devices.

         <title>Living Artificial Skin: Photosensitizer and Cell Sandwiched Bacterial Cellulose for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chronic wounds pose a significant global public health challenge due to their suboptimal treatment efficacy caused by bacterial infections and micro&#8208;circulatory disturbances. Inspired by the bio&#8208;functionality of natural skin, we bioengineered an artificial skin (HV@BC@TBG) with bacterial cellulose (BC) sandwiched between photosensitizers (PS) and functionalized living cells. Glucose&#8208;modified PS (TBG) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;functionalized living cells (HV) were successively modified on each side of BC through biological metabolism and bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction. As the outermost layer, the TBG layer could generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light illumination to efficiently combat bacterial infections. The HV layer was the inner layer near the diabetic wound, which served as a living factory to continuously secrete VEGF to accelerate wound repair by promoting fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis. The sandwiched structural artificial skin HV@BC@TBG was non&#8208;toxic, biocompatible, and demonstrated its ability to significantly accelerate the healing process of infected diabetic wounds, rendering it a promising next&#8208;generation medical therapy for chronic wound management.

         <title>Lamellar Nanoporous Metal/Intermetallic Compound Heterostructure Regulating Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Electrodeposition for Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are attractive post&#8208;lithium battery technologies for grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of their inherent safety, low cost and high theoretical capacity. However, their practical implementation in wide&#8208;temperature surroundings persistently confronts irregular zinc electrodeposits and parasitic side reactions on metal anode, which leads to poor rechargeability, low Coulombic efficiency and short lifespan. Here we report lamellar nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu heterostructure electrode as a promising anode host material to regulate high&#8208;efficiency and dendrite&#8208;free zinc electrodeposition and stripping for wide&#8208;temperatures aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In this unique electrode, the interconnective Cu/Al2Cu heterostructure ligaments not only facilitate fast electron transfer but work as highly zincophilic sites for zinc nucleation and deposition by virtue of local galvanic couples while the interpenetrative lamellar channels serving as mass transport pathways. As a result, it exhibits exceptional zinc plating/stripping behaviours in aqueous hybrid electrolyte of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and Zn(OTf)2 at wide temperatures ranging from 25&#176;C to &#8722;30&#176;C, with ultralow voltage polarizations at various current densities and ultralong lifespan of &gt;4000 hours. The outstanding electrochemical properties enlist full cell of zinc&#8208;ion batteries constructed with nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu anode host material and ZnxV2O5/C cathode to maintain high capacity and excellent stability for &gt;5000 cycles at 25&#176;C and &#8722;30&#176;C.

         <title>Structural isomeric effect on spin transport in molecular semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular semiconductor (MSC) is promising candidate for spintronic applications benefited from its long spin lifetime caused by light elemental&#8208;composition essence and thus weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). According to current knowledge, the SOC effect, normally dominated by the elemental composition, is the main spin&#8208;relaxation causation in MSCs, and thus molecular structure induced change of SOC is one of the most concerned issues. In theoretical study, molecular isomerism, a most prototype phenomena, has long been considered to possess little difference on spin transport previously, since elemental compositions of isomers are totally same. However, here in this study, quite different spin&#8208;transport performances have been demonstrated in ITIC and its structural isomers BDTIC experimentally, for the first time, though the charge transport and molecular stacking of two films are very similar. Together with further experiments of electron&#8208;paramagnetic resonance and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations, we reveal that noncovalent&#8208;conformational locks formed in BDTIC can lead to enhancement of SOC and thus decrease the spin lifetime. Hence, this study suggests the influences from structural&#8208;isomeric effect must be taken into account for developing high&#8208;efficient spin&#8208;transport MSCs, which also provides a reliably theoretical basis on solving the great challenge of quantificational measurement of NCLs in films in the future.

         <title>Supergravity&#8208;Steered Generic Manufacturing of Nanosheets&#8208;Embedded Nanocomposite Hydrogel with Highly&#8208;Oriented, Heterogenous Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing nanocomposite hydrogels with oriented nanosheets has been emerged as a promising toolkit to achieve preferential performances that go beyond their disordered counterparts. Although current fabrication strategies via electric/magnetic force fields have made remarkable achievements, they normally necessitate special properties of nanosheets and suffer from inferior orientation degree of nanosheets. Herein, we discover a facile and universal approach to elaborate MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels with highly&#8208;oriented, heterogenous architecture by virtue of supergravity to replace conventional force fields. The key to such architecture is to leverage bidirectional, force&#8208;tunable attributes of supergravity containing coupled orthogonal shear and centrifugal force field, enabling to steer high&#8208;efficient movement, pre&#8208;orientation, and stacking of MXene nanosheets in the bottom. Such a synergetic effect allows to yield heterogenous nanocomposite hydrogels with a high&#8208;orientation MXene&#8208;rich layer (orientation degree, f = 0.83) and a polymer&#8208;rich layer. We further demonstrate that MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels leverage their high&#8208;orientation, heterogenous architecture to deliver an extraordinary electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 55.2&#160;dB at 12.4&#160;GHz yet using a super&#8208;low MXene of 0.3 wt%, surpassing most hydrogels&#8208;based electromagnetic shielding materials. This versatile supergravity&#8208;steered strategy can be further extended to arbitrary nanosheets including MoS2, GO, and C3N4, offering a paradigm in the development of oriented nanocomposites.

&lt;p&gt;Designing nanocomposite hydrogels with oriented nanosheets has been emerged as a promising toolkit to achieve preferential performances that go beyond their disordered counterparts. Although current fabrication strategies via electric/magnetic force fields have made remarkable achievements, they normally necessitate special properties of nanosheets and suffer from inferior orientation degree of nanosheets. Herein, we discover a facile and universal approach to elaborate MXene-based nanocomposite hydrogels with highly-oriented, heterogenous architecture by virtue of supergravity to replace conventional force fields. The key to such architecture is to leverage bidirectional, force-tunable attributes of supergravity containing coupled orthogonal shear and centrifugal force field, enabling to steer high-efficient movement, pre-orientation, and stacking of MXene nanosheets in the bottom. Such a synergetic effect allows to yield heterogenous nanocomposite hydrogels with a high-orientation MXene-rich layer (orientation degree, f = 0.83) and a polymer-rich layer. We further demonstrate that MXene-based nanocomposite hydrogels leverage their high-orientation, heterogenous architecture to deliver an extraordinary electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 55.2&#160;dB at 12.4&#160;GHz yet using a super-low MXene of 0.3 wt%, surpassing most hydrogels-based electromagnetic shielding materials.

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a single&#8208;device contactless user&#8208;interaction sensing display by integrating humidity&#8208;sensing humidity hydrogel with an alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) device. The conductivity changes of the hydrogel as a fingertip approaches or from a human breath trigger the subsecond dynamic response of the ACEL, facilitating noncontact sensing and display.








Abstract
Creating a large&#8208;scale contactless user&#8208;interactive sensing display (CUISD) with optimal features is challenging but crucial for efficient human&#8211;human or human&#8211;machine interactions. This study reports a CUISD based on dynamic alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) that responds to humidity. Subsecond humidity&#8208;induced luminescence is achieved by integrating a highly responsive hydrogel into the ACEL layer. The patterned silver nanofiber electrode and luminescence layer, produced through electrospinning and microfabrication, result in a stretchable, large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;resolution, multicolor, and dynamic CUISD. The CUISD is implemented for the real&#8208;time control of a remote&#8208;controlled car, wherein the luminescence signals induced by touchless finger movements are distinguished and encoded to deliver specific commands. Moreover, the distinctive recognition of breathing facilitates the CUISD to serve as a visual signal transmitter for information interaction, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with disabilities. The paradigm shift depicts in this work is expected to reshape the way authors interact with each other and devices, discovering niche applications in virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse.

         <title>Giant X&#8208;Ray Circular Dichroism in a Time&#8208;Reversal Invariant Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article reveals a new type of altermagnet, in which the symmetry allows for typical ferromagnetic behaviors. It presents X&#8208;ray circular dichroism observed in a chiral antiferromagnet with time&#8208;reversal symmetry. This phenomenon contrasts conventional X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism. As X&#8208;rays propagate through the material, the Berry curvature, arising from the inversion symmetry breaking, gives rise to distinct circular dichroism.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray circular dichroism, arising from the contrast in X&#8208;ray absorption between opposite photon helicities, serves as a spectroscopic tool to measure the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials and identify the handedness of chiral crystals. Antiferromagnets with crystallographic chirality typically lack X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism because of time&#8208;reversal symmetry, yet exhibit weak X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism. Here, the observation of giant natural circular dichroism in the Ni L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption of Ni3TeO6 is reported, a polar and chiral antiferromagnet with effective time&#8208;reversal symmetry. To unravel this intriguing phenomenon, a phenomenological model is proposed that classifies the movement of photons in a chiral crystal within the same symmetry class as that of a magnetic field. The coupling of X&#8208;ray polarization with the induced magnetization yields giant X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism, revealing typical ferromagnetic behaviors allowed by the symmetry in an antiferromagnet, i.e., the altermagnetism of Ni3TeO6. The findings provide evidence for the interplay between magnetism and crystal chirality in natural optical activity. Additionally, the first example of a new class of magnetic materials exhibiting circular dichroism is established with time&#8208;reversal&#160;symmetry.

         <title>Trichome&#8208;Like Biomimetic Air Filters via Templated Silicone Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of plant&#8208;based purification, trichome&#8208;like biomimetic (TLB) air filters with three dimensional (3D)&#8208;templated silicon nanofilaments formed in situ onto preset template substrates with an average diameter of &#8776;74 nm are proposed based on a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, demonstrating extraordinary filtration performance.








Abstract
Air pollution threats to human health have increased awareness of the role of filter units in air cleaning applications. As an ideal energy&#8208;saving strategy for air filters, the slip effect on nanofiber surfaces can potentially overcome the trade&#8208;off between filtration efficiency and pressure drop. However, the potential of the slip effect in nanofibrous structures is significantly limited by the tight nanofiber stacks. In this study, trichome&#8208;like biomimetic (TLB) air filters with 3D&#8208;templated silicone nanofilaments (average diameter: &#8776;74 nm) are prepared based on an in situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method inspired by plant purification. Theoretical modeling and experimental results indicate that TLB air filters make significant use of the slip effect to overcome the efficiency&#8208;resistance tradeoff. The selectable filter class (up to U15, &#8776;99.9995%) allows TLB air filters to meet various requirements, and their integral filtration performance surpasses that of most commodity air filters, including melt&#8208;blown cloth, ePTFE membranes, electrospun mats, and glass fiber paper. The proposed strategy directly transforms commercial filter media and filters into TLB air filters using a bottom&#8208;up, one&#8208;step approach. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, reusable N95 respirators and air purifiers equipped with TLB air filters are fabricated, overcoming the limitations of existing filter designs and fabrication methods.

         <dc:description>
An X&#8208;ray responsive CO&#8208;releasing nanoparticle (HA@AuNC@CO) based on strong host&#8211;guest interaction between cyclodextrin protected&#8208;gold nanocluster and adamantane modified CO donor is developed for the combination of gas therapy and radio therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that HA@AuNC@CO exhibits active targeting toward CD44 overexpressed cancer cells and excellent inhibition of glycolysis for efficient radiotherapy against cancer.








Abstract
Glycolysis&#8208;dominant metabolic pathway in cancer cells can promote their therapeutic resistance against radiotherapy (RT). Carbon monoxide (CO) as a glycolysis inhibitor can enhance the efficiency of RT. Herein, an X&#8208;ray responsive CO&#8208;releasing nanocomposite (HA@AuNC@CO) based on strong host&#8211;guest interactions between the radiosensitizer and CO donor for enhanced RT is developed. The encapsulated gold nanoclusters (CD&#8208;AuNCs) can effectively generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X&#8208;ray radiation, which not only directly inactivate cancer cells but also induce in situ CO gas generation from adamantane modified metal carbonyl (Ada&#8208;CO) for glycolysis inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that HA@AuNC@CO exhibits active targeting toward CD44 overexpressed cancer cells, along with excellent inhibition of glycolysis and efficient RT against cancer. This study offers a new strategy for the combination of gas therapy and RT in tumor treatment.

         <title>Electronic Spin Alignment within Homologous NiS2/NiSe2 Heterostructures to Promote Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS2/NiSe2 interphase promotes spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni3+ transformation from low to high spin, thereby generating additional unpaired electrons. This high electronic spin configuration promotes the electrocatalytic polysulfide redox reaction within Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
The catalytic activation of the Li&#8208;S reaction is fundamental to maximize the capacity and stability of Li&#8208;S batteries (LSBs). Current research on Li&#8208;S catalysts mainly focuses on optimizing the energy levels to promote adsorption and catalytic conversion, while frequently overlooking the electronic spin state influence on charge transfer and orbital interactions. Here, hollow NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (NiS2/NiSe2@NC) are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructure promotes the spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni3+ transformation from low to high spin. This high spin configuration raises the electronic energy level and activates the electronic state. This&#160;accelerates the charge transfer and optimizes the adsorption energy, lowering the reaction energy barrier of the polysulfides&#160;conversion. Benefiting from these characteristics, LSBs based on NiS2/NiSe2@NC/S cathodes exhibit high initial capacity (1458 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (572 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 at 5C), and stable cycling with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.025% per cycle at 1C during 500 cycles. Even at high sulfur loadings (6.2 mg&#183;cm&#8315;2), high initial capacities of 1173 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 (7.27 mAh&#183;cm&#8315;2) are measured at 0.1C, and 1058 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 is retained after 300 cycles.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Curable 3D Printing of Circularly Polarized Afterglow Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Monoliths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#160;(MOFs) nanoparticles with different afterglow times are prepared by combining chiral induction approach and auxiliary ligands regulation strategy, displaying tunable circularly polarized luminescence afterglow performance. Furthermore, the corresponding chiral MOFs nanoparticles are first prepared to various chiral monoliths by photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technology for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications.








Abstract
Developing coordination complexes (such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, MOFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is currently attracting tremendous attention and remains a significant challenge in achieving MOF with circularly polarized afterglow. Herein, MOFs&#8208;based circularly polarized afterglow is first reported by combining the chiral induction approach and tuning the afterglow times by using the auxiliary ligands regulation strategy. The obtained chiral R/S&#8208;ZnIDC, R/S&#8208;ZnIDC(bpy), and R/S&#8208;ZnIDC(bpe)(IDC = 1H&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, bpy = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine, bpe = trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl) ethylene) containing a similar structure unit display different afterglow times with 3, 1, and &lt;0.1&#160;s respectively which attribute to that the longer auxiliary ligand hinders the energy transfer through the hydrogen bonding. The obtained chiral complexes reveal a strong chiral signal, obvious photoluminescence afterglow feature, and strong CPL performance (glum up to 3.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2). Furthermore, the photo&#8208;curing 3D printing method is first proposed to prepare various chiral MOFs based monoliths from 2D patterns to 3D scaffolds for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. This work not only develops chiral complexes monoliths by photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technique but opens a new strategy to achieve tunable CPL afterglow in optical applications.

         <title>Photochemical Design for Diverse Controllable Patterns in Self&#8208;Wrinkling Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy to constructing arbitrary on&#8208;demand self&#8208;wrinkle patterns on polyurethane elastomers via spatiotemporal photochemistry boundaries is developed. This technology allows for the attainment of a diverse array of controllable patterns, ranging from highly 2D ordered to periodic or intricate designs, providing a versatile basis for applications in anticounterfeiting devices, dynamic light grating, and functional systems.








Abstract
Harnessing the spontaneous surface instability of pliable substances to create intricate, well&#8208;ordered, and on&#8208;demand controlled surface patterns holds great potential for advancing applications in optical, electrical, and biological processes. However, the current limitations stem from challenges in modulating multidirectional stress fields and diverse boundary environments. Herein, this work proposes a universal strategy to achieve arbitrarily controllable wrinkle patterns via the spatiotemporal photochemical boundaries. Utilizing constraints and inductive effects of the photochemical boundaries, the multiple coupling relationship is accomplished among the light fields, stress fields, and morphology of wrinkles in photosensitive polyurethane (PSPU) film. Moreover, employing sequential light&#8208;irradiation with photomask enables the attainment of a diverse array of controllable patterns, ranging from highly ordered 2D patterns to periodic or intricate designs. The fundamental mechanics of underlying buckling and the formation of surface features are comprehensively elucidated through theoretical stimulation and finite element analysis. The results reveal the evolution laws of wrinkles under photochemical boundaries and represent a new effective toolkit for fabricating intricate and captivating patterns in single&#8208;layer films.

         <title>Regulating Surface&#8208;Passivator Binding Priority for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between passivator and perovskite is quantitatively assessed to optimize defect passivation. Through modulating adsorption configuration and coordination capacity of the passivator, the intense bonding with perfect perovskite is significantly reduced and leads to enhanced interaction with defects. The near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes without any external light&#8208;coupling achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 24.3% and ultralong operational lifetime.








Abstract
Suppressing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative losses through passivators is a prerequisite for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, the complex bonding between passivators and perovskites severely suppresses the passivation process, which still lacks comprehensive understanding. Herein, the number, category, and degree of bonds between different functional groups and the perovskite are quantitatively assessed to study the passivation dynamics. Functional groups with high electrostatic potential and large steric hindrance prioritize strong bonding with organic cations and halides on the perfect surface, leading to suppressed coordination with bulky defects. By modulating the binding priorities and coordination capacity, hindrance from the intense interaction with perfect perovskite is significantly reduced, leading to a more direct passivation process. Consequently, the near&#8208;infrared PeLED without external light out&#8208;coupling demonstrates a record external quantum efficiency of 24.3% at a current density of 42&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, the device exhibits a record&#8208;level&#8208;cycle ON/OFF switching of 20&#160;000 and ultralong half&#8208;lifetime of 1126.3&#160;h under 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. An in&#8208;depth understanding of the passivators can offer new insights into the development of high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Deciphering the Performance Enhancement, Cell Failure Mechanism, and Amelioration Strategy of Sodium Storage in Metal Chalcogenides&#8208;Based Andes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) materials can achieve excellent performance in ether&#8208;based electrolyte with Cu current collector but suffers from inevitable cycle life termination. It is delved into the origins of performance enhancement and the mechanisms behind cell failure in TMC&#8208;based anodes when paired with ether&#8208;based electrolytes, while also proposed effective strategies to mitigate such failures.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) emerge as promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), heralding a new era of energy storage solutions. Despite their potential, the mechanisms underlying their performance enhancement and susceptibility to failure in ether&#8208;based electrolytes remain elusive. This study delves into these aspects, employing CoS2 electrodes as a case in point to elucidate the phenomena. The investigation reveals that CoS2 undergoes a unique irreversible and progressive solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid phase transition from its native state to sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), and ultimately to a Cu1.8S/Co composite, accompanied by a gradual morphological transformation from microspheres to a stable 3D porous architecture. This reconstructed 3D porous structure is pivotal for its exceptional Na+ diffusion kinetics and resilience to cycling&#8208;induced stress, being the main reason for ultrastable cycling and ultrahigh rate capability. Nonetheless, the CoS2 electrode suffers from an inevitable cycle life termination due to the microshort&#8208;circuit induced by Na metal corrosion and separator degradation. Through a comparative analysis of various TMCs, a predictive framework linking electrode longevity is established to electrode potential and Gibbs free energy. Finally, the cell failure issue is significantly mitigated at a material level (graphene encapsulation) and cell level (polypropylene membrane incorporation) by alleviating the NaPSs shuttling and microshort&#8208;circuit.

&lt;p&gt;The transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) materials can achieve excellent performance in ether-based electrolyte with Cu current collector but suffers from inevitable cycle life termination. It is delved into the origins of performance enhancement and the mechanisms behind cell failure in TMC-based anodes when paired with ether-based electrolytes, while also proposed effective strategies to mitigate such failures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) emerge as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), heralding a new era of energy storage solutions. Despite their potential, the mechanisms underlying their performance enhancement and susceptibility to failure in ether-based electrolytes remain elusive. This study delves into these aspects, employing CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes as a case in point to elucidate the phenomena.

         <title>Projection Stereolithography 3D Printing High&#8208;Conductive Hydrogel for Flexible Passive Wireless Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A projection stereolithography 3D printable high&#8208;conductive hydrogel is developed, which enables customization of electronic circuits. Sealing the partially dehydrated hydrogel circuits can achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&#8722;1), stretchability and stability (&gt;1 month). Furthermore, the customized passive radio frequency identification tags are fabricated by assembling the printed antennas with commercial chips, which realize wireless sensing of eye movement.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based electronics have inherent similarities to biological tissues and hold potential for wearable applications. However, low conductivity, poor stretchability, nonpersonalizability, and uncontrollable dehydration during use limit their further development. In this study, projection stereolithography 3D printing high&#8208;conductive hydrogel for flexible passive wireless sensing is reported. The prepared photocurable silver&#8208;based hydrogel is rapidly planarized into antenna shapes on substrates using surface projection stereolithography. After partial dehydration, silver flakes within the circuits form sufficient conductive pathways to achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&#8722;1). By sealing the circuits to prevent further dehydration, the resistance remains stable when tensile strain is less than 100% for at least 30 days. Besides, the sealing materials provide versatile functionalities, such as stretchability and shape memory property. Customized flexible radio frequency identification tags are fabricated by integrating with commercial chips to complete the accurate recognition of eye movement, realizing passive wireless sensing.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal Linear Array Detector for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 329&#8208;type halide perovskite single crystal (SC) is developed by a new growth strategy, which shows&#160;significantly increased &#181;&#964; product. Therefore, the SC detectors achieve high detection sensitivity, fast response, and superior stability. In addition, the assembled SC linear array detector realizes high spatial resolution during X&#8208;ray imaging, which is expected to be a new&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection technology.








Abstract
0D Bi&#8208;based 329&#8208;type halide perovskite is demonstrated as a promising semiconductor for X&#8208;ray detection due to its strong X&#8208;ray absorption, superior stability, availability of large single crystals (SCs) and solution processibility at low temperature. However, its low mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#181;&#964;) limits its further improvement in detection sensitivity. Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, this work designs a new 2D Bi&#8208;based 329&#8208;type halide perovskite using a mixed&#8208;halide&#8208;induced structural dimension regulation strategy. By using a continuous supply of a precursor solution, this work successfully grows inch&#8208;sized high&#8208;quality SCs. These SCs exhibit large &#181;&#964; product, high resistivity, and low ion migration. The detectors fabricated using the SCs show X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity as high as 24,509 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, short response time of 315 &#181;s, low detection limit of 4.3 nGy s&#8722;1, and superior stability. These properties are the best among all lead&#8208;free perovskite detectors and are comparable to those of the best lead&#8208;based perovskite detectors. The linear array detector assembled on the SCs for the first time also shows a high spatial resolution of 10.6 lp mm&#8722;1 during X&#8208;ray imaging. The high performance combined with superior stability of these new 329&#8208;type lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCs is expected to promote a new generation of X&#8208;ray detection technologies.

         <title>A Natural Casein&#8208;Based Separator with Brick&#8208;and&#8208;Mortar Structure for Stable, High&#8208;Rate Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost pH&#8208;sensitive natural protein is used to modify GO nanosheets and a Cu2+&#8208;coordinated casein&#8208;GO composite protective layer is constructed in situ on the surface of a glass fiber separator (GO&#8208;casein&#8208;Cu2+ separator) in order to inhibit the solubility and shuttling of small organic molecules, which ensures excellent cycling and rate performance of proton batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous proton batteries with small organic molecule anodes are currently considered promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, stable safety, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application is limited by the poor cycling stability caused by the shuttling of soluble organic molecules between electrodes. Herein, a cell separator is modified by a GO&#8208;casein&#8208;Cu2+ layer with a brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar structure to inhibit the shuttling of small organic molecules. Experimental and calculation results indicate that, attributed to the synergistic effect of physical blocking of casein molecular chains and electrostatic and coordination interactions of Cu2+, bulk dissolution and shuttling of multiple small molecules can be inhibited simultaneously, while H+ transfer across the separators is not almost affected. With the protection of the GO&#8208;casein&#8208;Cu2+ separator, soluble small molecules, such as diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine,2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexacyano (6CN&#8208;DQPZ) exhibit a high reversible capacity of 262.6 mA h g&#8722;1 and amazing stability (capacity retention of 92.9% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). In addition, this strategy is also proved available to other active conjugated small molecules, such as indanthrone (IDT), providing a general green sustainable strategy for advancing the use of small organic molecule electrodes in proton cells.

         <title>Gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted Mechanical Exfoliation of Large&#8208;area 2D layers Enables Efficient and Precise Construction of Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>

Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, consisting of rotationally aligned 2D atomically thin layers, provide a highly novel platform for the study of correlated quantum phenomena. However, reliable and efficient construction of moir&#233; superlattices is challenging because of difficulties to accurately angle&#8208;align small exfoliated 2D layers and the need to shun wet&#8208;transfer processes. Here, we demonstrate efficient and precise construction of various moir&#233; superlattices by picking up and stacking large&#8208;area 2D mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer crystals with predetermined crystal axes, made possible by a gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted mechanical exfoliation method. The exfoliated 2D layers are semiconductors, superconductors, or magnets and their high quality is confirmed by photoluminescence and Raman spectra and by electrical transport measurements of fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors and Hall devices. Twisted homobilayers with angle&#8208;twisting accuracy of &#8764;0.3 degrees, twisted heterobilayers with sub&#8208;degree angle&#8208;alignment accuracy, and multilayer superlattices have been precisely constructed and characterized by their moir&#233; patterns, interlayer excitons, and second harmonic generation. The present study paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena in moir&#233; superlattices.

         <title>Microscale Chiral Rectennas for Energy Harvesting</title>

Abstract
Wireless radiofrequency rectifiers have the potential to power the billions of &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; devices currently in use by effectively harnessing the ambient electromagnetic radiation. However, the current technology relies on the implementation of rectifiers based on Schottky diodes, which exhibit limited capabilities for high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;power applications. Consequently, they require an antenna to capture the incoming signal and amplify the input power, thereby limiting the possibility of miniaturizing devices to the millimeter scale. Here, we report wireless rectification at the GHz range in a microscale device built on single chiral Tellurium with extremely low input powers. By studying the crystal symmetry and the temperature dependence of the rectification, we demonstrate that its origin is the intrinsic nonlinear conductivity of the material. Additionally, we show the unprecedent ability to modulate the rectification output by an electrostatic gate. Our results open the path to develop tuneable microscale wireless rectifiers with a single material.

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation and Cascaded Sum Frequency Generation from a Surface Crystallized Glass Ceramic Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of novel materials and structures for efficient second&#8208;order nonlinear micro/nano devices remains a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate the remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and even cascaded sum frequency generation (CSFG) in whispering gallery mode microspheres made of surface&#8208;crystallized glass with a 6&#8208;&#956;m Ba2TiSi2O8 crystal layer. Attributed to the core&#8208;shell design, the Ba2TiSi2O8 located on the surface can be efficiently coupled with whispering gallery modes, resulting in a highly efficient micron&#8208;scale cavity&#8208;enhanced second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity. Greatly enhanced SHG of the microcavity was observed, which is up to 80 times stronger than that of non&#8208;resonant bulk sample. Furthermore, owing to the wavelength non&#8208;selectivity of random quasi&#8208;phase matching, we demonstrated ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860&#160;nm to 1600&#160;nm and high&#8208;contrast polarization characteristics. The glass&#8208;ceramic based microsphere cavity also boosts the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of CSFG. This work delineates an efficient strategy for boosting nonlinear optical response in glass&#8208;ceramics, which will open up new opportunities for applications in photonics and optical communications.

         <title>Simple Sol&#8208;gel Protein Stabilization towards Rainbow &amp; White Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are heralded as a paradigm of sustainable materials for photonics/optoelectronics. However, their stabilization under non&#8208;physiological environments and/or harsh operation conditions is the major challenge. Among the FP&#8208;stabilization methods, classical sol&#8208;gel is the most effective, but less versatile, as most of the proteins/enzymes easily degraded due to the need of multi&#8208;step processes, surfactants, and mixed water/organic solvents in extreme pH. Herein, we revisited sol&#8208;gel chemistry with archetypal FPs (mGL; mCherry), simplifying the method by one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and aqueous media (phosphate buffer saline pH = 7.4). The synthesis mechanism involves the direct reaction of the carboxylic groups at the FP surface with the silica precursor, generating a positively charged FP intermediate that acts as a seed for the formation of size&#8208;controlled mesoporous FP@SiO2 nanoparticles. Green&#8208;/red&#8208;emissive (single&#8208;FP component) and dual&#8208;emissive (multi&#8208;FPs component; no need of kinetic studies) FP@SiO2 were prepared without affecting the FP photoluminescence and stabilities (&gt;6 months) under dry storage and organic solvent suspensions. Finally, FP@SiO2 color filters were applied to rainbow and white bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes featuring up to 15&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities without reducing luminous efficacy compared to references with native FPs. Overall, we demonstrate an easy, versatile, and effective FP&#8208;stabilization method in FP@SiO2 towards sustainable protein lighting.

Abstract
Bioelectricity plays a crucial role in organisms, being closely connected to neural activity and physiological processes. Disruptions in the nervous system can lead to chaotic ionic currents at the injured site, causing disturbances in the local cellular microenvironment, impairing biological pathways, and resulting in a loss of neural functions. Electromagnetic stimulation has the ability to generate internal currents, which can be utilized to counter tissue damage and aid in the restoration of movement in paralyzed limbs. By incorporating implanted materials, electromagnetic stimulation can be targeted more accurately, thereby significantly improving the effectiveness and safety of such interventions. Currently, there have been significant advancements in the development of numerous promising electromagnetic stimulation strategies with diverse materials. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the fundamental theories, neural stimulation modulating materials, material application strategies, and pre&#8208;clinical therapeutic effects associated with electromagnetic stimulation for neural repair. It offers a thorough analysis of current techniques that employ materials to enhance electromagnetic stimulation, as well as potential therapeutic strategies for future applications.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst via Spin Manipulation for Efficient Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The interaction between oxygen species and metal sites of various orbitals exhibits intimate correlation with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, we represent a new approach for boosting the inherent ORR activity of atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C matrix by implanting Fe&#160;atomic clusters nearby. Our as&#8208;prepared catalyst delivers excellent ORR activity with half&#8211;wave potentials of 0.78&#160;V and 0.90&#160;V in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. The decent ORR activity could also be validated from the high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery. The experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron spin&#8211;state of monodispersed Fe active sites is transferred from the low spin (LS, t2g6 eg0) to the medium spin (MS, t2g5 eg1) due to the involvement of Fe atomic clusters, leading to the spin electron filling in &#963;&#8727; orbit, by which it favors OH&#8722; desorption and in turn boosts the reaction kinetics of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work paves a solid way for rational design of high&#8208;performance Fe&#8211;based single atom catalysts through spin manipulation.

         <title>Strengthening the Synergy Between Oxygen Vacancies in Electrocatalysts for Efficient Glycerol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Defect&#8208;engineered bimetallic oxides exhibit high potential for the electrolysis of small organic molecules. However, the ambiguity in the relationship between the defect density and electrocatalytic performance makes it challenging to control the final products of multi&#8208;step multi&#8208;electron reactions in such electrocatalytic systems. In this study, controllable kinetics reduction was used to maximize the oxygen vacancy density of a Cu&#8211;Co oxide nanosheet (CuCo2O4 NS), which was used to catalyze the glycerol electrooxidation reaction (GOR). The CuCo2O4&#8722;x NS with the highest oxygen&#8208;vacancy density (CuCo2O4&#8722;x&#8208;2) oxidized C3 molecules to C1 molecules with selectivity of almost 100% and a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;99%, showing the best oxidation performance among all the modified catalysts. Systems with multiple oxygen vacancies in close proximity to each other synergistically facilitated the cleavage of C&#8211;C bonds. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the ability of closely spaced oxygen vacancies to facilitate charge transfer between the catalyst and several key glycolic&#8208;acid (GCA) intermediates of the GOR process, thereby facilitating the decomposition of C2 intermediates to C1 molecules. This study reveals qualitatively in tuning the density of oxygen vacancies for altering the reaction pathway of GOR by the synergistic effects of spatial proximity of high&#8208;density oxygen vacancies.

In this study, controllable kinetics reduction was used to maximize the oxygen vacancy density of a Cu&#8211;Co oxide nanosheet (CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NS), which was used to catalyze the glycerol electrooxidation reaction (GOR). The CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt; NS with the highest oxygen-vacancy density (CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;-2) oxidized C3 molecules to C1 molecules with selectivity of almost 100% and a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;99%, showing the best oxidation performance among all the modified catalysts. Systems with multiple oxygen vacancies in close proximity to each other synergistically facilitated the cleavage of C&#8211;C bonds. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the ability of closely spaced oxygen vacancies to facilitate charge transfer between the catalyst and several key glycolic-acid (GCA) intermediates of the GOR process, thereby facilitating the decomposition of C2 intermediates to C1 molecules. This study reveals qualitatively in tuning the density of oxygen vacancies for altering the reaction pathway of GOR by the synergistic effects of spatial proximity of high-density oxygen vacancies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Noncontact Microfluidics of Highly Viscous Liquids for Accurate Self&#8208;Splitting and Pipetting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Accurate dosing for various liquids, especially for highly viscous liquids, is fundamental in wide ranging from molecular crosslinking to material processing. Despite droppers or pipettes being widely used as pipetting devices, they are powerless for quantificationally splitting and dosing highly viscous liquids (&gt; 100 mPa&#8901;s) like polymer liquids due to the intertwined macromolecular chains and strong cohesion energy. Here, we provide a highly transparent photopyroelectric slippery (PS) platform to achieve noncontact self&#8208;splitting for liquids with viscosity as high as 15000 mPa&#8901;s, just with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source to provide a local temperature difference (&#916;T). Moreover, to guarantee the accuracy for pipetting liquids (&gt; 80%), the ultrathin MXene film (within a thickness of 20&#160;nm) was self&#8208;assembled as the photo&#8208;thermal layers, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between transparency and photothermal property. Compared with traditional pipetting strategies (&#8764; 1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate microfluidic chip shows a great potential in adhesive system (bonding strength, twice than using the droppers or pipettes).

         <title>Halide Exchange in Perovskites Enables Bromine/Iodine Hybrid Cathodes for Highly Durable Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the increasing need for reliable storage systems, the conversion&#8208;type chemistry typified by bromine cathodes has attracted considerable attention due to sizeable theoretical capacity, cost efficiency, and high redox potential. However, the severe loss of active species during operation remains a problem, leading researchers to resort to concentrated halide&#8208;containing electrolytes. Here, profiting from the intrinsic halide exchange in perovskite lattices, we proposed a novel low&#8208;dimensional halide hybrid perovskite cathode, TmdpPb2[IBr]6, which served not only as a halogen reservoir for reversible three&#8208;electron conversions but also as an effective halogen absorbent by surface Pb dangling bonds, C&#8208;H&#8230;Br hydrogen bonds, and Pb&#8208;I&#8230;Br halogen bonds. As such, the Zn||TmdpPb2[IBr]6 battery delivered three remarkable discharge voltage plateaus at 1.21&#160;V (I0/I&#8722;), 1.47&#160;V (I+/I0), and 1.74&#160;V (Br0/Br&#8722;) in a typical halide&#8208;free electrolyte, meanwhile realizing a high capacity of over 336 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.4 A g&#8722;1 and high capacity retention of 88% and 92% after 1000 cycles at 1.2 A g&#8722;1 and 4000 cycles at 3.2 A g&#8722;1, respectively, accompanied by a high coulombic efficiency of around 99%. The work highlighted the promising conversion&#8208;type cathodes based on metal&#8208;halide perovskite materials.

         <title>Water Catchers within Sub&#8208;Nano Channels Promote Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step Zinc&#8208;Ion Dehydration Enable Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Zinc metal suffered from violent and long&#8208;lasting water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrollable dendritic Zn growth, which seriously reduced the coulombic efficiency (CE) and lifespan of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). To suppress the corresponding harmful effects of the highly active water, a stable zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework with water catchers decorated inside its sub&#8208;nano channels was used to protect Zn&#8208;metal. Water catchers within narrow channels can constantly trap water molecules from the solvated Zn&#8208;ions and facilitate step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation/dehydration, thereby promoting the formation of an aggregative electrolyte configuration, which consequently eliminate water&#8208;induced corrosion and side reactions. More importantly, the functionalized sub&#8208;nano channels also acted as ion rectifiers and promoted fast but even Zn&#8208;ions transport, thereby leading to a dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal. As a result, the protected Zn metal demonstrated an unprecedented cycling stability of more than 10000 hours and an ultra&#8208;high average CE of 99.92% during 4000 cycles. More inspiringly, a practical NH4V4O10//Zn pouch&#8208;cell was fabricated and delivered a capacity of 98 mAh (under high cathode mass loading of 25.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and preserved 86.2% capacity retention after 150 cycles. This new strategy in promoting highly reversible Zn metal anodes would spur the practical utilizations of AZMBs.

         <title>Phase&#8208;centric MOCVD Enabled Synthetic Approaches for Wafer&#8208;scale 2D Tin Selenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Following an initial nucleation stage at the flake level, atomically thin film growth of a van der Waals material is promoted by ultrafast lateral growth and prohibited vertical growth. To produce these highly anisotropic films, synthetic or post&#8208;synthetic modifications are required, or even a combination of both, to ensure large&#8208;area, pure&#8208;phase and low&#8208;temperature deposition. We hereby present a set of synthetic strategies to selectively produce wafer&#8208;scale tin selenides, SnSex (both x = 1 and 2), in the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) forms. The 2D&#8208;SnSe2 films with tuneable thicknesses are directly grown via metal&#8208;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at 200&#160;&#176;C, and they exhibit outstanding crystallinities and phase homogeneities and consistent film thickness across the entire wafer. This is enabled by excellent control of the volatile metal&#8208;organic precursors and decoupled dual temperature regimes for high&#8208;temperature ligand cracking and low&#8208;temperature growth. In contrast, SnSe, intrinsically inhibited from 2D growth, is indirectly prepared by a thermally driven phase transition of an as&#8208;grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 film with all the benefits of the MOCVD technique. It is accompanied by the electronic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type crossover at the wafer scale. Our tailor&#8208;made synthetic routes will accelerate the low&#8208;thermal&#8208;budget production of multiphase 2D materials in a reliable and scalable fashion.

         <title>Fast Na+ Kinetics and Suppressed Voltage Hysteresis Enabled by a High&#8208;Entropy Strategy for Sodium Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy configuration within transition metal slabs helps to strengthen TMO2 skeleton and enlarge the sodium ion diffusion channel, which promotes fast Na+ kinetics, reversible TM redox and phase transition as well as decreased voltage hysteresis, thus achieving impressive electrochemical performance for sodium oxide cathodes.








Abstract
O3&#8208;type layered transition metal cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their sufficient sodium reservoir. However, sluggish sodium ions kinetics and large voltage hysteresis, which are generally associated with Na+ diffusion properties and electrochemical phase transition reversibility, drastically minimize energy density, reduce energy efficiency, and hinder further commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, this work proposes a high&#8208;entropy tailoring strategy through manipulating the electronic local environment within transition metal slabs to circumvent these issues. Experimental analysis combined with theoretical calculations verify that high&#8208;entropy metal ion mixing contributes to the improved reversibility of redox reaction and O3&#8211;P3&#8211;O3 phase transition behaviors as well as the enhanced Na+ diffusivity. Consequently, the designed O3&#8208;Na0.9Ni0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Mn0.2Ti0.15Cu0.05O2 material with high&#8208;entropy characteristic could display a negligible voltage hysteresis (&lt;0.09 V), impressive rate capability (98.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 5 C). This work provides insightful guidance in mitigating the voltage hysteresis and facilitating Na+ diffusion of layered oxide cathode materials to realize high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;energy SIBs.

&lt;p&gt;High-entropy configuration within transition metal slabs helps to strengthen TMO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; skeleton and enlarge the sodium ion diffusion channel, which promotes fast Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; kinetics, reversible TM redox and phase transition as well as decreased voltage hysteresis, thus achieving impressive electrochemical performance for sodium oxide cathodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O3-type layered transition metal cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their sufficient sodium reservoir. However, sluggish sodium ions kinetics and large voltage hysteresis, which are generally associated with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion properties and electrochemical phase transition reversibility, drastically minimize energy density, reduce energy efficiency, and hinder further commercialization of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, this work proposes a high-entropy tailoring strategy through manipulating the electronic local environment within transition metal slabs to circumvent these issues. Experimental analysis combined with theoretical calculations verify that high-entropy metal ion mixing contributes to the improved reversibility of redox reaction and O3&#8211;P3&#8211;O3 phase transition behaviors as well as the enhanced Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusivity. Consequently, the designed O3-Na&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; material with high-entropy characteristic could display a negligible voltage hysteresis (&amp;lt;0.09 V), impressive rate capability (98.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10 C) and long-term cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 5 C). This work provides insightful guidance in mitigating the voltage hysteresis and facilitating Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion of layered oxide cathode materials to realize high-rate and high-energy SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skin&#8208;Inspired All&#8208;Natural Biogel for Bioadhesive Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, inspired by the role of natural moisturizing factor in the skin, a straightforward yet versatile approach for fabricating highly ductile, ionically conductive, long&#8208;term stable, and fully degradable all&#8208;natural gelatin&#8208;based biogel is presented. The developed biogel holds promise for constructing reliable bio&#8208;interfaces for electrophysiological signal recording, offering high signal fidelity and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Natural material&#8208;based hydrogels are considered ideal candidates for constructing robust bio&#8208;interfaces due to their environmentally sustainable nature and biocompatibility. However, these hydrogels often encounter limitations such as weak mechanical strength, low water resistance, and poor ionic conductivity. Here, inspired by the role of natural moisturizing factor (NMF) in skin, a straightforward yet versatile strategy is proposed for fabricating all&#8208;natural ionic biogels that exhibit high resilience, ionic conductivity, resistance to dehydration, and complete degradability, without necessitating any chemical modification. A well&#8208;balanced combination of gelatin and sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (an NMF compound) gives rise to a significant enhancement in the mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capacity of the biogel compared to pure gelatin hydrogel. The biogel manifests temperature&#8208;controlled reversible fluid&#8208;gel transition properties attributed to the triple&#8208;helix junctions of gelatin, which enables in situ gelation on diverse substrates, thereby ensuring conformal contact and dynamic compliance with curved surfaces. Due to its salutary properties, the biogel can serve as an effective and biocompatible interface for high&#8208;quality and long&#8208;term electrophysiological signal recording. These findings provide a general and scalable approach for designing natural material&#8208;based hydrogels with tailored functionalities to meet diverse application needs.

         <title>High Entropy Alloys Enable Durable and Efficient Lithium&#8208;Mediated CO2 Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, hcp NiFeCoCuRu HEAs with a 2.17 nm particle size, immobilized on KB matrix at 30 wt%, are designed. HEA30/KB catalyst exhibits robust performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries (LCBs), achieving &#8776;3000 h stability and low overpotential (0.82 V). XAS analyses and theoretical calculations reveal charge redistribution and active clusters of Ru, Co, and Ni as key factors.








Abstract
Designing electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for multistep reduction and oxidation reactions is challenging. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are intriguing due to their tunable geometric and electronic structure through entropy effects. However, understanding the origin of their exceptional performance and identifying active centers is hindered by the diverse microenvironment in HEAs. Herein, NiFeCoCuRu HEAs designed with an average diameter of 2.17 nm, featuring different adsorption capacities for various reactants and intermediates in Li&#8208;mediated CO2 redox reactions, are introduced. The electronegativity&#8208;dependent nature of NiFeCoCuRu HEAs induces significant charge redistribution, shifting the d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level and forming highly active clusters of Ru, Co, and Ni for Li&#8208;based compounds adsorptions. This lowers energy barriers and simultaneously stabilizes *LiCO2 and LiCO3+CO intermediates, enhancing the efficiency of both CO2 reduction and Li2CO3 decomposition over extended periods. This work provides insights into specific active site interactions with intermediates, highlighting the potential of HEAs as promising catalysts for intricate CO2 redox reactions.

         <title>Reversible Mechanical Contraception and Endometriosis Treatment Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stimuli&#8208;degradable hydrogel implant for reversible fallopian tube occlusion, offering an alternative to permanent sterilization and endometriosis treatment, is introduced. These hydrogel implants mechanically block the tubes with high effectiveness and are removable within 30 min using UV light or a glutathione solution. Demonstrating in ex vivo and in vivo models, this multifunctional system provides a potential method for on&#8208;demand contraception and a mechanical approach to prevent and treat abdominal endometriosis.








Abstract
Female sterilization via fallopian tube ligation is a common procedure; However, after the operation, over 10% of women seek re&#8208;fertilization, which is frequently unsuccessful. In addition, there is evidence that fallopian tubes contribute to the spread of endometriotic tissue as they serve as channels for proinflammatory media entering the abdominal cavity via retrograde menstruation. Here, stimuli&#8208;degradable hydrogel implants are presented for the functional, biocompatible, and reversible occlusion of fallopian tubes. The hydrogel implants, designed with customized swelling properties, mechanically occlude fallopian tubes in a high&#8208;performance manner with burst pressures reaching 255&#8211;558&#160;mmHg, exceeding normal abdominal pressures (95&#160;mmHg). Their damage&#8208;free removal can be achieved within 30 min using near&#8208;visible UV light or a glutathione solution, employing a method akin to standard fallopian tube perfusion diagnostics. Ultrasound&#8208;guided implant placement is demonstrated using a clinical hysteroscope in a human&#8208;scale uterus model and biocompatibility in a porcine in vivo model. Importantly, the prevention of live sperm as well as endometrial cell passage through blocked fallopian tubes is demonstrated. Overall, a multifunctional system is presented that constitutes a possible means of on&#8208;demand, reversible contraception along with the first&#8208;ever mechanical approach to abdominal endometriosis prevention and treatment.

         <title>A Multimodal Self&#8208;Propelling Tensegrity Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid tensegrity structure (HTS) is constructed by integrating thermally responsive cables, nonresponsive cables, and stiff rods. The HTS can continuously extract energy from the hot surface and undertake self&#8208;propelling rolling. By adjusting the position of the active cables, the HTS can roll in different repetitive locomotive modes autonomously in response to thermal stimuli.








Abstract
Tensegrity structure is composed of tensile cables and compressive rods, offering high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;mass ratio, deploy ability, and excellent energy damping capability. The active and dynamic tensegrity designs demonstrate great potential for soft robots. In previous designs, the movement has relied on carefully controlled input power or manually controlled light irradiation, limiting their potential applications. Here, a hybrid tensegrity structure (HTS) is constructed by integrating thermally responsive cables, nonresponsive cables, and stiff rods. The HTS can self&#8208;propel continuously on a hot surface due to its unique geometry. The HTS allows for the easy achievement of multimodal self&#8208;propelled locomotive modes, which has been challenging for previously demonstrated self&#8208;propelling structures. Additionally, using Velcro tapes to adhere the rods and cables together, a modulable and reassemblable HTS is created. The HTS introduced in this study presents a new strategy and offers a large design space for constructing self&#8208;propelling and modulable robots.

         <title>Prevented Cell Clusters&#8217; Migration Via Microdot Biomaterials for Inhibiting Scar Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microdot biomaterial system is constructed using &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles for inhibiting adhesion of injured tendon. By slowly releasing mitochondria&#8208;targeted functional polypeptides and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents in an inflammatory environment to promote the inflow of extracellular Ca2+, they can inhibit the N&#8208;cadherin expression and promote fibroblast apoptosis, synergistically inhibiting adhesion of injured tendons.








Abstract
Cluster&#8208;like collective cell migration of fibroblasts is one of the main factors of adhesion in injured tissues. In this research, a microdot biomaterial system is constructed using &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles, which are prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;amino acids&#8208;N&#8208;carboxylic anhydrides (NCAs) and lactide, respectively. The microdot biomaterial system slowly releases functionalized polypeptides targeting mitochondria and promoting the influx of extracellular calcium ions under the inflammatory environment, thus inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin mediating cell&#8211;cell interaction, and promoting apoptosis of cluster fibroblasts, synergistically inhibiting the migration of fibroblast clusters at the site of tendon injury. Meanwhile, the anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles are celecoxib (Cex) solubilized by PEG/polyester, which can improve the inflammatory microenvironment at the injury site for a long time. In vitro, the microdot biomaterial system can effectively inhibit the migration of the cluster fibroblasts by inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin between cell&#8211;cell and promoting apoptosis. In vivo, the microdot biomaterial system can promote apoptosis while achieving long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;inflammation effects, and reduce the expression of vimentin and &#945;&#8208;smooth muscle actin (&#945;&#8208;SMA)&#160;in fibroblasts. Thus, this microdot biomaterial system provides new ideas for the prevention and treatment of tendon adhesion by inhibiting the cluster migration of fibroblasts.

&lt;p&gt;A microdot biomaterial system is constructed using &#945;-helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti-inflammatory micelles for inhibiting adhesion of injured tendon. By slowly releasing mitochondria-targeted functional polypeptides and anti-inflammatory agents in an inflammatory environment to promote the inflow of extracellular Ca2+, they can inhibit the N-cadherin expression and promote fibroblast apoptosis, synergistically inhibiting adhesion of injured tendons.

         <title>Engineering Spin&#8208;Orbit Interactions in Silicon Qubits at the Atomic&#8208;Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different Dresselhaus and Rashba spin&#8208;orbit strengths from 0 &#8722; 1113 &#215; 10&#8722;13 eV cm for spin qubits can be engineered by placing phosphorus atoms in different lattice locations in the silicon crystal. The charge noise induced spin relaxation can therefore be minimized when there is no effective spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The results are verified by experimental measurements, atomistic simulations, and symmetry analysis.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit interactions arise whenever the bulk inversion symmetry and/or structural inversion symmetry of a crystal is broken providing a bridge between a qubit's spin and orbital degree of freedom. While strong interactions can facilitate fast qubit operations by all&#8208;electrical control, they also provide a mechanism to couple charge noise thereby limiting qubit lifetimes. Previously believed to be negligible in bulk silicon, recent silicon nano&#8208;electronic devices have shown larger than bulk spin&#8208;orbit coupling strengths from Dresselhaus and Rashba couplings. Here, it is shown that with precision placement of phosphorus atoms in silicon along the [110] direction (without inversion symmetry) or [111] direction (with inversion symmetry), a wide range of Dresselhaus and Rashba coupling strength can be achieved from zero to 1113 &#215; 10&#8722;13eV&#8208;cm. It is shown that with precision placement of phosphorus atoms, the local symmetry (C2v, D2d, and D3d) can be changed to engineer spin&#8208;orbit interactions. Since spin&#8208;orbit interactions affect both qubit operation and lifetimes, understanding their impact is essential for quantum processor&#160;design.

         <title>Gradient High&#8208;Q Dielectric Metasurfaces for Broadband Sensing and Control of Vibrational Light&#8208;Matter Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mid&#8208;infrared all&#8208;dielectric gradient metasurfaces, realized by gradually varying unit cell parameters along the structure, provide continuous tuning of high&#8208;Q resonances over an ultra&#8208;broad spectral range in a compact device footprint. The unmatched flexibility of such metasurfaces for SEIRA applications, including polymer mixture deconvolution, sensitive broadband biomolecule detection, and exploring the onset of vibrational strong coupling are demonstrated.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) has emerged as a powerful technique for ultrasensitive chemical&#8208;specific analysis. SEIRA can be realized by employing metasurfaces that can enhance light&#8208;matter interactions in the spectral bands of molecular vibrations. Increasing sample complexity emphasizes the need for metasurfaces that can operate simultaneously at different spectral bands, both accessing rich spectral information over a broad band, and resolving subtle differences in the absorption fingerprints through narrow&#8208;band resonances. Here, a novel concept of resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces is introduced, where the required spectral selectivity is achieved via local high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor (high&#8208;Q) resonances, while the continuous coverage of a broad band is enabled by the gradual adjustment of the unit&#8208;cell dimensions along the planar structure. The highly tailorable design of the gradient metasurfaces provides flexibility for shaping the spectral sampling density to match the relevant bands of target analytes while keeping a compact device footprint. The versatility of the gradient metasurfaces is demonstrated through several sensing scenarios, including polymer mixture deconvolution, detecting a multistep bioassay, and identification of the onset of vibrational strong coupling regime. The proposed gradient&#8208;resonance platform significantly contributes to the rapidly evolving landscape of nonlocal metasurfaces, enabling applications in molecular detection and analysis of fundamental light&#8208;matter interaction phenomena.

This study introduces an efficient method for producing a high&#8208;yield, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, free&#8208;standing super&#8208;powder, adaptable to various nanoparticle shapes and compositions. Utilizing Au nanorings with their distinctive aspect ratio, allows for the formation of packed columnar assemblies, aligning the exposed inter&#8208;particles gaps perpendicular to the laser beam, thereby improving surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy detection under both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;contamination conditions.








Abstract
This study presents a straightforward and efficient synthetic approach for producing high&#8208;yield, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, free&#8208;standing super&#8208;powder. The synthesis protocol demonstrates versatility, enabling the creation of assemblies from various nanoparticle morphologies and compositions without the need for specific substrates. Au nanorings are employed as building blocks for fabricating the super&#8208;powder, which can be used in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The distinctive aspect ratio of the ring nanoframes allows the formation of densely packed columnar assemblies on the substrate, aligning the exposed gaps perpendicular to the laser beam. This arrangement significantly enhances the charge separation among nanorings, leading to a highly focused near&#8208;field that is applicable to SERS analysis. The SERS detection feasibility of this powder in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;contamination conditions is demonstrated. Using a wide range of building blocks, encompassing various shapes (for instance, rods, hexagons, cubes, cuboctahedrons, elongated dodecahedrons, triangular rings, double&#8208;rings, elongated dodecahedra frames, cuboctahedra frames, and double&#8208;walled frames), the generalizability of the process for synthesizing super&#8208;powders with diverse morphologies is substantiated.

         <title>A Viscous&#8208;Biofluid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing to Accelerate Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing (SPD) with aligned hydrated hydrogel channels based on a 3D&#8208;WET polymerization process is designed. The SPD exhibits a rapid water drainage speed and efficient draining of viscous fluids. In a diabetic rat model, the SPD shortens inflammation phase, promotes re&#8208;epithelialization, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition, thereby accelerating diabetic wound healing.








Abstract
Viscous biofluids on wounds challenge conventional &#8220;water&#8208;absorbing&#8221; wound dressings in efficient drainage due to their poor fluidity, generally causing prolonged inflammation, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and delayed wound closure. Herein, it is reported that a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing (SPD) with aligned hydrated hydrogel channels, prepared by a three&#8208;dimensional&#8208;templated wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (3D&#8208;WET) polymerization process, can efficiently drain viscous fluids and accelerate diabetic wound healing. The asymmetric wettability of the hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic layers and aligned hydrated hydrogel channels enable unidirectional and efficient drainage of viscous fluids away from the wounds, preventing their overhydration and inflammatory stimulation. The organogel layer can adhere onto the skin around the wounds but can be easily detached from the wet wound area, avoiding secondary trauma to the newly formed tissues. Taking a diabetic rat model as an example, the SPD can significantly downregulate the inflammation response by &#8776;70.8%, enhance the dermal remodeling by &#8776;14.3%, and shorten wound closure time by about 1/3 compared with the commercial dressing (3M, Tegaderm hydrocolloid thin dressing). This study sheds light on the development of the next generation of functional dressings for chronic wounds involving viscous biofluids.

         <title>Atomic Pt Sites Anchored in the Interface between Grains on Vacancy&#8208;Enriched CeO2 Nanosheets: One&#8208;Step Precursor Combustion Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step precursor combustion strategy for developing atomic Pt catalysts is proposed, which results in the atomic Pt sites anchored in the interface between grains on vacancy&#8208;enriched CeO2 nanosheets. Thereinto, the atomic Pt sites with the low valence state in the CeO2 interface can improve the low&#8208;temperature activity for a three&#8208;way catalyst.








Abstract
Atomic metal catalysts have unique electronic, structural, and catalytic properties, which are widely used in the field of catalysis. However, designing new simple synthesis methods to fabricate atomic metal catalysts is a challenge in catalytic applications. Herein, a one&#8208;step precursor combustion strategy is presented that starts directly from precursors of metal salts, using a spontaneous combustion process convert platinum nitrate to atomic Pt sites. The atomic Pt sites with low valence are anchored in the formed interface between grains on vacancy&#8208;enriched CeO2 nanosheets. The obtained Pt/CeO2&#8208;2 catalyst exhibits much higher three&#8208;way catalytic activities at low temperatures than Pt/CeO2&#8208;C catalysts prepared using the traditional impregnation method. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated lower valent Pt atoms in the CeO2 interface promote catalytic activity through reducing the energy barrier, and lead to an overall improvement of three&#8208;way catalytic activities. This facile strategy provides new insights into the study of the properties and applications of atomic noble metal catalysts.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Co&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate to Urea with High Faradaic Efficiency on Cobalt&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) act as a highselective electrocatalyst for urea production by C&#8211;N coupling, offering a large urea yield of 2217.5 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and a remarkably high Faradaic efficiency of 54.3%. The rationally constructed point&#8208;to&#8208;face architecture favors exposure of more active sites, sufficient catalyst&#8208;electrolyte contact, and fast reactant/product diffusion.








Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered nitrate/carbon dioxide co&#8208;reduction reaction toward urea production paves an attractive alternative to industrial urea processes and offers a clean on&#8208;site approach to closing the global nitrogen cycle. However, its large&#8208;scale implantation is severely impeded by challenging C&#8211;N coupling and requires electrocatalysts with high activity/selectivity. Here, cobalt&#8208;nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) are proposed as a catalyst electrode to boost yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward urea electrosynthesis with enhanced C&#8211;N coupling. Such Co NPs@C renders superb urea&#8208;producing activity with a high FE reaching 54.3% and a urea yield of 2217.5 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1, much superior to the Co NPs and C nanosheet counterparts, and meanwhile shows strong stability. The Co NPs@C affords rich catalytically active sites, fast reactant diffusion, and sufficient catalytic surfaces&#8208;electrolyte contacts with favored charge and ion transfer efficiencies. The theoretical calculations reveal that the high&#8208;rate formation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates is crucial for facilitating urea synthesis.

         <title>Narrow Bandgap Schottky Heterojunction Sonosensitizer with High Electron&#8211;Hole Separation Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG Schottky heterojunction sonosensitizer boosted the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) leads to mitochondrial depolarization and DNA damage under US irradiation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of bladder tumor cells. In both subcutaneous and orthotopic bladder tumor models, TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG demonstrates a notable inhibitory effect on the proliferation of bladder tumors and a significant enhancement of sonodynamic therapy efficacy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is applied to bladder cancer (BC) given its advantages of high depth of tissue penetration and nontoxicity due to the unique anatomical location of the bladder near the abdominal surface. However, low electron&#8211;hole separation efficiency and wide bandgap of sonosensitizers limit the effectiveness of SDT. This study aims to develop a TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG Schottky heterojunction sonosensitizer with high electron&#8211;hole separation and narrow bandgap for SDT in BC. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments collectively demonstrate that the bandgap of TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG is reduced due to the Schottky heterojunction with the characteristic of crystalline&#8208;amorphous interface formed by the deposition of ruthenium (Ru) within the shell layer of TiO2. Thanks to the enhancement of oxygen adsorption and the efficient separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs, TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound (US) irradiation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of bladder tumor cells. The in vivo results prove that TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG boosted the subcutaneous and orthotopic bladder tumor models while exhibiting good safety. This study adopts the ruthenium complex for optimizing sonosensitizers, contributing to the progress of SDT improvement strategies and presenting a paradigm for BC therapy.

         <title>Pyroelectric Photoconductive Diode for Highly Sensitive and Fast DUV Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of highly sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors is a huge challenge. This work proposes a strategy to boost detection performance by coupling the interface pyroelectric effect with the photoconductive effect based on engineered polycrystal Ga&#8208;rich GaOx Schottky photodiode (i.e., pyroelectric photoconductive diodes). The pyroelectric photoconductive diodes exhibit ultrahigh detection performance for deep ultraviolet and X&#8208;ray light.








Abstract
Detecting high&#8208;energy photons from the deep ultraviolet (DUV) to X&#8208;rays is vital in security, medicine, industry, and science. Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors exhibit great potential for detecting high&#8208;energy photons. However, the implementation of highly sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors based on WBG semiconductors has been a huge challenge due to the inevitable deep level traps and the lack of appropriate device structure engineering. Here, a sensitive and fast pyroelectric photoconductive diode (PPD), which couples the interface pyroelectric effect with the photoconductive effect based on tailored polycrystal Ga&#8208;rich GaOx (PGR&#8208;GaOx) Schottky photodiode, is first proposed. The PPD device exhibits ultrahigh detection performance for DUV and X&#8208;ray light. The responsivity for DUV light and sensitivity for X&#8208;ray are up to 104 A W&#8722;1 and 105 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. Especially, the interface pyroelectric effect induced by polar symmetry in the depletion region of the PGR&#8208;GaOx can significantly improve the response speed of the device by 105 times. Furthermore, the potential of the device is demonstrated for imaging enhancement systems with low power consumption and high sensitivity. This work fully excavates the potential of the pyroelectric effect for detectors and provides a novel design strategy to achieve sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors.

         <title>A Solid&#8211;Liquid Bicontinuous Fiber with Strain&#8208;Insensitive Ionic Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize strain&#8208;insensitive ionic conduction for high&#8208;fidelity signal transmission, a solid&#8211;liquid bicontinuous fiber via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation is designed. The fiber features a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion&#8208;conducting phase, forming highly tortuous ionic channels. Remarkably, stretch mainly straightens these channels, leading to a minimal resistance increase with strain, outperforming the vast majority of existing ionic conductors.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic conductors are crucial for enabling advanced iontronic devices to operate under diverse deformation conditions. However, when employed as interconnects, existing ionic conductors struggle to maintain stable ionic conduction under strain, hindering high&#8208;fidelity signal transmission. Here, it is shown that strain&#8208;insensitive ionic conduction can be achieved by creating a solid&#8211;liquid bicontinuous microstructure. A bicontinuous fiber from polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation, which contains a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion&#8208;conducting phase, is fabricated. The spontaneous partitioning of dissolved salts leads to the formation of a robust self&#8208;wrinkled interface, fostering the development of highly tortuous ionic channels. Upon stretch, these meandering ionic channels are straightened, effectively enhancing ionic conductivity to counteract the strain effect. Remarkably, the fiber retains highly stable ionic conduction till fracture, with only 7% resistance increase at 200% strain. This approach presents a promising avenue for designing durable ionic cables capable of signal transmission with minimal strain&#8208;induced distortion.

&lt;p&gt;To realize strain-insensitive ionic conduction for high-fidelity signal transmission, a solid&#8211;liquid bicontinuous fiber via polymerization-induced phase separation is designed. The fiber features a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion-conducting phase, forming highly tortuous ionic channels. Remarkably, stretch mainly straightens these channels, leading to a minimal resistance increase with strain, outperforming the vast majority of existing ionic conductors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stretchable ionic conductors are crucial for enabling advanced iontronic devices to operate under diverse deformation conditions. However, when employed as interconnects, existing ionic conductors struggle to maintain stable ionic conduction under strain, hindering high-fidelity signal transmission. Here, it is shown that strain-insensitive ionic conduction can be achieved by creating a solid&#8211;liquid bicontinuous microstructure. A bicontinuous fiber from polymerization-induced phase separation, which contains a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion-conducting phase, is fabricated. The spontaneous partitioning of dissolved salts leads to the formation of a robust self-wrinkled interface, fostering the development of highly tortuous ionic channels. Upon stretch, these meandering ionic channels are straightened, effectively enhancing ionic conductivity to counteract the strain effect. Remarkably, the fiber retains highly stable ionic conduction till fracture, with only 7% resistance increase at 200% strain. This approach presents a promising avenue for designing durable ionic cables capable of signal transmission with minimal strain-induced distortion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Printable Block Molecular Assemblies with Controlled Exciton Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of molecular heterostructure is successfully fabricated, with precise control over exciton dynamics in each block (including singlet and triplet excitons featuring ns, &#181;s, and ms emission lifetimes). Moreover, these heterostructures are printable and can be accurately positioned using a Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, leading to programable patterns.








Abstract
Creating hierarchical molecular block heterostructures, with the control over size, shape, optical, and electronic properties of each nanostructured building block can help develop functional applications, such as information storage, nanowire spectrometry, and photonic computing. However, achieving precise control over the position of molecular assemblies, and the dynamics of excitons in each block, remains a challenge. In the present work, the first fabrication of molecular heterostructures with the control of exciton dynamics in each block, is demonstrated. Additionally, these heterostructures are printable and can be precisely positioned using Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, resulting in programable patterns. Singlet excitons with emission lifetimes on nanosecond or microsecond timescales and triplet excitons with emission lifetimes on millisecond timescales appear simultaneously in different building blocks, with an efficient energy transfer process in the heterojunction. These organic materials also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive emission by changing the power or wavelength of the excitation laser. Potential applications of these organic heterostructures in integrated photonics, where the versatility of fluorescence, phosphorescence, efficient energy transfer, printability, and stimulus sensitivity co&#8208;exist in a single nanowire, are foreseen.

         <title>Breaking Fundamental Limitation of Flow&#8208;Induced Anisotropic Growth for Large&#8208;Scale and Fast Printing of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental limitation of flow&#8208;induced anisotropy during the growth of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) is effectively overcome by a surfactant&#8208;additive printing method, which enables the deposition of uniform OSCFs. Fabricated 10 &#215; 10 flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor array&#8208;based on the OSCFs exhibit substantial improvements in average mobility up to 10.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, reaching a high value among flexible organic devices.








Abstract
Advanced organic electronic technologies have put forward a pressing demand for cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs). However, solution&#8208;printed OSCFs are typically plagued by the existence of abundant structural defects, which pose a formidable challenge to achieving large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;performance organic electronics. Here, it is elucidated that these structural defects are mainly originated from printing flow&#8208;induced anisotropic growth, an important factor that is overlooked for too long. In light of this, a surfactant&#8208;additive printing method is proposed to effectively overcome the anisotropic growth, enabling the deposition of uniform OSCFs over the wafer scale at a high speed of 1.2 mm s&#8722;1 at room temperature. The resulting OSCF exhibits appealing performance with a high average mobility up to 10.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values for flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor arrays. Moreover, large&#8208;scale OSCF&#8208;based flexible logic circuits, which can be bent without degradation to a radius as small as 4.0 mm and over 1000 cycles are realized. The work provides profound insights into breaking the limitation of flow&#8208;induced anisotropic growth and opens new avenues for printing large&#8208;scale organic single&#8208;crystal electronics.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Living Polymer Networks with Adaptive Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The advent of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) through the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds has led to unprecedented properties of macromolecular systems, which can be engineered at the molecular level. Among the various types of stimuli that can be used to trigger chemical changes within polymer networks, light stands out for its remote and spatiotemporal control under ambient conditions. However, most examples of photoactive CANs need to be transparent and they exhibit slow response, side reactions, and limited light penetration. In this vein, we are interested in understanding how molecular engineering of optically active dynamic linkages that offer fast response to visible light can impart &#8220;living&#8221; characteristics to CANs, especially in opaque systems. Here, we report the use of carbazole&#8208;based thiuram disulfides (CTDs) that offer dual reactivity as photoactivated reshuffling linkages and iniferters under visible light irradiation. The fast response to visible light activation of the CTDs leads to temporal control of shape manipulation, healing, and chain extension in the polymer networks, despite the lack of optical transparency. This strategy charts a promising avenue for manipulating multifunctional photoactivated CANs in a controlled manner.

         <title>Enzymatic Mesoporous Metal Nanocavities for Concurrent Electrocatalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia Coupled with Polyethylene Terephthalate Upcycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of waster pollutants into high value&#8208;added fuels and/or chemicals is recognized as a green and sustainable solution that can address the resource utilization on earth. Despites great efforts, their progress has seriously been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. In this work, bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as a new bifunctional enzymatic electrocatalyst that realizes concurrent electrocatalytic upcycling of nitrate wastewater and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic water. Abundant metal mesopores and open nanocavities of PdCu MCs provide the enzymatic confinement of key intermediates for the deeper electroreduction of nitrate and accelerate the transport of reactants/products within/out of electrocatalyst, thus affording high ammonia Faradic efficiency (FENH3) of 96.6% and yield rate of 5.6&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 at the cathode. Meanwhile, PdCu MC nanozymes trigger the selective electrooxidation of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into glycolic acid (GA) and formic acid with high FEs of &gt; 90% by a facile regulation of potentials at the anode. Moreover, concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and GA is disclosed in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system, further confirming the high efficiency of bifunctional PdCu MC nanozymes in producing value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals from waster pollutants in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes with Interfacial Percolation Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable electrodes are an essential component that determines the functionality and reliability of stretchable electronics, but face the challenge of balancing conductivity and stretchability. Here, we propose a new conducting concept called the interfacial percolation network (PN) that results in stretchable electrodes with high conductivity, large stretchability, and high stability. The interfacial PN was composed of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) PN and a protruding PN embedded on the surface and in the near&#8208;surface region of an elastic polymer matrix, respectively. The protruding PN was the key design to intimately link the 2D conducting channels on the surface of the elastomer with the 3D conducting channels in the bulk of the elastomer. The protruded PN was obtained by changing the arrangements of silver nanowires (AgNWs) from horizontal to quasi&#8208;vertical through introducing foreign polymer domains in the near&#8208;surface region of the polymer matrix. The resulting electrode achieved a conductivity of 13,500 S cm&#8722;1 and a stretchability of up to 660%. Its resistance changes (i.e., R/R0) under stretched conditions were orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional 2D PN and 2D + 3D PN. This electrode performed stability in various physicochemical conditions, including being soaked in acid and alkaline solutions for 20 days, heated at 80&#160;&#176;C for 10 days, stretched to 80% for 10000 cycles, and scratched by a sharp needle. The concept of interfacial PN was broadly applicable to common conductors used in stretchable electronics, such as graphene, gold film, Ag film, and liquid metal. The conductivity of the interfacial PN electrode made from liquid metal remained at 46,750 S cm&#8722;1 after the electrode underwent multiple stretch&#8208;release cycles with a deformation of &gt;600%. The concept of interfacial PN provides fruitful implications for the design of stretchable electronics.

Its resistance changes (i.e., R/R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) under stretched conditions were orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional 2D PN and 2D + 3D PN. This electrode performed stability in various physicochemical conditions, including being soaked in acid and alkaline solutions for 20 days, heated at 80&#160;&#176;C for 10 days, stretched to 80% for 10000 cycles, and scratched by a sharp needle. The concept of interfacial PN was broadly applicable to common conductors used in stretchable electronics, such as graphene, gold film, Ag film, and liquid metal. The conductivity of the interfacial PN electrode made from liquid metal remained at 46,750 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after the electrode underwent multiple stretch-release cycles with a deformation of &amp;gt;600%. The concept of interfacial PN provides fruitful implications for the design of stretchable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Orally Ingested Self&#8208;Powered Stimulators for Targeted Gut&#8211;Brain Axis Electrostimulation to Treat Obesity and Metabolic Disorders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Obesity is a significant health concern that often leads to metabolic dysfunction and chronic diseases. This study introduces a novel approach to combat obesity using orally ingested self&#8208;powered electrostimulators. These electrostimulators consist of piezoelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) particles conjugated with capsaicin (Cap) and aim to activate the vagus nerve. Upon ingestion by diet&#8208;induced obese (DIO) mice, the BTO@Cap particles specifically target and bind to Cap&#8208;sensitive sensory nerve endings in the gastric mucosa. In response to stomach peristalsis, these particles generate electrical signals. The signals travel via the gut&#8211;brain axis, ultimately influencing the hypothalamus. By enhancing satiety signals in the brain, this neuromodulatory intervention reduces food intake, promotes energy metabolism, and demonstrates minimal toxicity. Over a three&#8208;week period of daily treatments, DIO mice treated with BTO@Cap particles show a significant reduction in body weight compared to control mice, while maintaining their general locomotor activity. Furthermore, this BTO@Cap particle&#8208;based treatment mitigates various metabolic alterations associated with obesity. Importantly, this noninvasive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;administer intervention holds potential for addressing other intracerebral neurological diseases.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

Abstract
Metal nanoparticle cocatalysts are widely investigated for their ability to enhance the performance of photocatalytic materials, however their practical application is often limited by the inherent instability under light irradiation. This challenge has catalyzed interest in exploring high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), which, with their increased entropy and lower Gibbs free energy, provide superior stability. In this study, we successfully synthesized 3.5&#160;nm sized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free nanoparticles (NPs) composed of a FeCoNiCuMn HEA. With theoretic calculation and experiments, the electronic structure of HEA in augmenting the catalytic CO2 reduction has been uncovered, including the individual roles of each element and the collective synergistic effects. We then investigated their photocatalytic CO2 reduction capabilities when immobilized on TiO2. HEA NPs significantly enhanced the CO2 photoreduction, achieving a 23&#8208;fold increase over pristine TiO2, with CO and CH4 production rates of 235.2&#160;&#181; mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 19.9&#160;&#181; mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively. Meanwhile, HEA NPs showed excellent stability under simulated solar irradiation, as well high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray irradiation. This research emphasizes the promising role of HEA nanoparticles, composed of earth&#8208;abundant elements, in revolutionizing the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Monochorionic Twinning in Bioengineered Human Embryo Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Monochorionic twinning of human embryos increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. The rarity of such twinning events, combined with ethical constraints in human embryo research, makes investigating the mechanisms behind twinning practically infeasible. As a result, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the origins and early phenotypic presentation of monochorionic twin embryos. In this study, a microthermoformed&#8208;based microwell screening platform is used to identify conditions that efficiently induce monochorionic twins in human stem cell&#8208;based blastocyst models, termed &#8220;twin blastoids&#8221;. These twin blastoids contain a cystic GATA3+ trophectoderm&#8208;like epithelium encasing two distinct inner cell masses (ICMs). Morphological and morphokinetic analyses reveal that twinning occurs during the cavitation phase via splitting of the OCT4+ pluripotent core. Notably, each ICM in twin blastoids contains its own NR2F2+ polar trophectoderm&#8208;like region, ready for implantation. This is functionally tested in a microfluidic chip&#8208;based implantation assay with epithelial endometrium cells. Under defined flow regimes, twin blastoids show increased adhesion capacity compared to singleton blastoids, suggestive of increased implantation potential. In conclusion, the development of technology enabling large&#8208;scale formation of twin blastoids, coupled with high&#8208;sensitivity readout capabilities, presents an unprecedented opportunity for systematically exploring monochorionic twin formation and its impact on embryonic development.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;large Stress and Strain Polymer Nanocomposite Actuators Incorporating a Mutually&#8208;Interpenetrated, Collective&#8208;Deformation Carbon Nanotube Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;based actuators have been extensively studied, with the challenging goal of achieving comprehensive performance metrics that include large output stress and strain, fast response, and versatile actuation modes. The design and fabrication of nanocomposites offer a promising route to integrate the advantages of both polymers and nanoscale fillers, thus ensuring superior performance. Here, we start from a three&#8208;dimensional porous sponge to fabricate a mutually interpenetrated nanocomposite, in which the embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) network undergoes collective deformation with the shape memory polymer (SMP) matrix during large&#8208;degree stretching and releasing, increases junction density with polymer chains and enhances molecular orientation. These features result in substantial improvement of the overall mechanical properties and during thermally actuated contraction, the bulk SMP/CNT composites exhibit output stresses up to 19.5 &#177; 0.97&#160;MPa and strains up to 69%, accompanied by a rapid response and high energy density, exceeding the majority of recent reports. Furthermore, electrical actuation is also demonstrated via uniform Joule heating across the self&#8208;percolated CNT network. Applications as low&#8208;temperature thermal actuated vascular stent and wound&#8208;dressing have been explored. Our findings lay out a universal blueprint for developing robust and highly deformable SMP/CNT nanocomposite actuators with broad potential applications.

         <title>TSG6&#8208;Exo@CS/GP Attenuates Endometrium Fibrosis by Inhibiting Macrophage Activation in a Murine IUA Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intrauterine adhesion (IUA), commonly known as Asherman's syndrome, is a disease characterized by the formation of fibrous scar tissue within the uterine cavity, which can lead to severe clinical complications and significantly compromise the reproductive health and fertility of women. Unfortunately, severe cases of IUA currently lack effective treatment. This study presents a novel approach that utilizes TSG6&#8208;modified exosomes (Exos) in conjunction with an injectable thermosensitive hydrogel (CS/GP) to mitigate the occurrence of IUA by reducing endometrium fibrosis in a mouse IUA model. The findings of this study demonstrate that TSG6&#8208;modified Exos effectively inhibit the activation of inflammatory M1&#8208;like macrophages during the initial stages of inflammation and maintains the balance of macrophage phenotypes (M1/M2) during the repair phase. Moreover, TSG6 inhnibits the interaction between macrophages and endometrial stromal fibroblasts, thereby preventing the activation of stromal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Furthermore, our research indicates that CS/GP facilitates the sustained release of TSG6&#8208;modified Exos, leading to a significant reduction in both the manifestations of IUA and the extent of endometrium fibrosis. Collectively, through the successful construction of CS/GP loaded with TSG6&#8208;modified Exos, we have achieved a reduction in the occurrence and progression of IUA by mitigating endometrium fibrosis. Consequently, this approach holds promise for the treatment of IUA.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Attention Network based Spectral Reconstruction with Snapshot Near&#8208;Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral information is important for detecting and analyzing material compositions. However, snapshot NIR spectral imaging systems still pose significant challenges owing to the lack of high&#8208;performance NIR filters and bulky setups, preventing effective encoding and integration with mobile devices. In this study, we introduce a snapshot spectral imaging system that employs a compact NIR metasurface featuring 25 distinct C4 symmetry structures. Benefitting from the sufficient spectral variety and low correlation coefficient among these structures, center&#8208;wavelength accuracy of 0.05&#160;nm and full width at half maximum (FWHM) accuracy of 0.13&#160;nm are realized. The system maintains good performance within an incident angle of 1&#176;. A novel meta&#8208;attention network prior iterative denoising reconstruction (MAN&#8208;IDR) algorithm guided by both meta&#8208;attention and spatial&#8208;spectral attention is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality NIR spectral imaging. By leveraging the designed metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR, the NIR spectral images, exhibiting precise textures, minimal artifacts in the spatial dimension, and little crosstalk between spectral channels, are reconstructed from a single grayscale recording image. Furthermore, the reconstruction of images in different colors with spatial overlaps is successfully demonstrated, showing the remarkable potential of the system in distinguishing objects. By enabling practical image reconstruction and distinction, the proposed NIR metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR hold great promise for further integration with smartphones and drones, guaranteeing the adoption of NIR spectral imaging in real&#8208;world scenarios such as aerospace, health diagnostics, and machine vision.

         <title>Achieving Self&#8208;Reinforcing Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Nanogenerator by Magnetocaloric and Magnetization Effects of Gadolinium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (TEHG) has emerged as a promising technology for distributed energy harvesting. However, currently reported hybrid generators are straightforward combinations of two functional components. Moreover, inevitable heat from friction intensifies material abrasion and degrades the performance of polymer&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Here, a self&#8208;reinforcing TEHG that harnesses the magnetocaloric and magnetization effects of gadolinium (Gd) is proposed. The synergy between TENG and electromagnetic generator (EMG) renders them an indivisible unit. Leveraging Gd's magnetocaloric effect, an efficient heat transfer mechanism is constructed to cool the tribolayer and strengthen the device's electrical stability. After 80 hours of continuous operation, the optimized TENG occupies a charge decay rate of only 0.32% per hour, significantly outperforming most existing TENGs. Additionally, Gd's magnetization effect boosts the power of EMG by approximately 80.84%. This work provides a universal solution in hybrid generators where internal components reinforce each other, achieving a synergistic effect of 1+1&gt;2.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;synthesized Surfactant&#8208;free Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube&#8208;based NO2 Sensors: Unprecedentedly High Sensitivity and Fast Recovery</title>

Abstract
This study pioneers a chemical sensor based on surfactant&#8208;free aerosol&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films for detecting nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Unlike conventional CNTs, the SWCNTs used in this study exhibit one of the highest surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios. They showed minimal bundling without the need for surfactants and had the lowest number of defects among reported CNTs. Furthermore, the dry&#8208;transferrable and facile one&#8208;step lamination resulted in promising industrial viability. When applied to devices, the sensor has excellent sensitivity (41.6% at 500 ppb), rapid response/recovery time (14.2/120.8 s), a remarkably low limit of detection (below &#8764;0.161 ppb), minimal noise, repeatability for more than 50 cycles without fluctuation, and long&#8208;term stability for longer than 6 months. This is the best performance reported for a pure CNT&#8208;based sensor. In addition, the aerosol SWCNTs demonstrated consistent gas&#8208;sensing performance even after 5000 bending cycles, indicating their suitability for wearable applications. Based on experimental and theoretical analyses, the proposed aerosol CNTs are expected to overcome the limitations associated with conventional CNT&#8208;based sensors, thereby offering a promising avenue for various sensor applications.

Abstract
The rapid advancement of prevailing communication and sensing technologies necessitates cost&#8208;effective millimeter&#8208;wave arrays equipped with a massive number of phase&#8208;shifting cells to perform complicated beamforming tasks. Conventional approaches employing semiconductor switch/varactor components or tunable materials encounter obstacles such as quantization loss, high cost, high complexity, and limited adaptability for realizing large&#8208;scale arrays and operating at millimeter&#8208;wave frequencies. Here, we report a low&#8208;cost, ultrathin, fast&#8208;response, and large&#8208;scale solution relying on advanced metasurface (i.e., the 2D version of a bulk 3D metamaterial) concepts combined together with ultrathin liquid crystal (LC) materials requiring a layer thickness of only 5 &#956;m. Rather than immersing resonant structures in LCs, a joint material&#8208;circuit&#8208;based strategy is devised, via integrating deep&#8208;subwavelength&#8208;thick nematic LCs into slow&#8208;wave structures, to achieve constitutive metacells (i.e., artificial atoms or meta&#8208;atoms) with continuous phase shifting and stable reflectivity. A LC&#8208;facilitated reconfigurable metasurface system containing more than 2300 metacells is realized with its unprecedented comprehensive wavefront manipulation capacity validated through three diverse beamforming functions, including beam focusing/steering, reconfigurable OAM&#8208;carrying beams, and tunable holograms, demonstrating a milli&#8208;second&#8208;level function&#8208;switching speed. The proposed methodology offers a paradigm shift for modulating electromagnetic waves in a non&#8208;resonating broadband fashion with fast&#8208;response and low&#8208;cost properties by exploiting functionalized LC&#8208;enabled metasurfaces. Moreover, it is expected that this extremely agile metasurface&#8208;enabled antenna technology will facilitate a transformative impact on communication/sensing systems and empower new possibilities for wavefront engineering and diffractive wave calculation/inference.

         <title>Universal Design Strategy for Air&#8208;Stable Layered Na&#8208;Ion Cathodes toward Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon footprint of Na&#8208;ion batteries is significantly increased due to the air stability issue of layered cathodes. In this paper, the air degradation origins and mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, and a universal design strategy is proposed for the rational design of air&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion cathodes toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) are sustainable alternatives to Li&#8208;ion technologies due to the abundant and widely&#8208;distributed resources. However, the most promising cathode materials of NIBs so far, O3 layered oxides, suffer from serious air instability issues, which significantly increases the manufactural cost and carbon footprint because of the long&#8208;term use of dry rooms. While some feasible strategies are proposed via case studies, universal design strategies for air&#8208;stable cathodes are yet to be established. Herein, the air degradation mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, with bond dissociation energy proposed as an effective descriptor for predicting air stability. Experimental validations in various unary, binary, and ternary O3 cathodes confirm that the air stability can indeed be effectively improved via simple compositional design. Guided by the predictive model, the designed material can sustain 30&#8208;day air&#8208;storage without structural or electrochemical degradation. It is calculated that such air&#8208;stable cathodes can significantly reduce both energy consumption (&#8776;4&#8201;100&#8201;000&#160;kWh) and carbon footprint (&#8776;2200&#8208;ton CO2) annually for a 2 GWh NIBs manufactory. Therefore, the fundamental understandings and universal design strategy presented open an avenue for rational materials design of NIBs toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocompatible bottlebrush polymer (BB) can rapidly adhere to various substrates, offering exceptional antifouling and lubricant properties. It holds promise for treating diseases linked to bio&#8208;lubricant systems and optimizing the performance of medical devices, including contact lenses.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers (BB) have emerged as compelling candidates for biosystems to face tribological challenges, including friction and wear. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of an engineered triblock BB polymer's affinity, cell toxicity, lubrication, and wear protection in both in vitro and in vivo settings, focusing on applications for conditions like osteoarthritis and dry eye syndrome. Results show that the designed polymer rapidly adheres to various surfaces (e.g., cartilage, eye, and contact lens), forming a robust, biocompatible layer for surface lubrication and protection. The tribological performance and biocompatibility are further enhanced in the presence of hyaluronic acid (HA) both in vitro and in vivo. The exceptional lubrication performance and favorable interaction with HA position the synthesized triblock polymer as a promising candidate for innovative treatments addressing deficiencies in bio&#8208;lubricant systems.

         <title>Stabilization of Lattice Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Oxophilic Ce&#8208;Mediated Bi/BiCeO1.8H Electrocatalysts for Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Bi/BiCeO1.8H containing under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms is proposed and demonstrated for lattice oxygen redox&#8208;catalyzed oxygen evolution electrocatalysts using a simple electrosynthesis. Bi/BiCeO1.8H&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V and catalytic stability for 100 h at a practically high current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) offers an efficient reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in energy storage and conversion systems. Owing to the involvement of active lattice oxygen enhancing electrochemical activity, addressing the structural and electrochemical stabilities of LOM materials is crucial. Herein, a heterostructure (Bi/BiCeO1.8H) containing abundant under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms having oxygen nonbonding states is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition method. Given the difference in reduction potentials between Bi and Ce, partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms are generated in BiCeO1.8H. It is found that the lattice oxygen can be activated as a reactant of the OER when the valence state of Bi increases to Bi5+, leading to increased metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and that the oxophilic Ce3+/4+ redox couple can maintain the Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over&#8208;oxidation of Bi. The anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Bi/BiCeO1.8H exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V even at a high practical current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the cell performance remains significantly stable over 100 h with only a 2.2% increase in the initial cell voltage, demonstrating sustainable lattice oxygen redox.

         <title>Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite Optoelectronic Synapse for Rapid Trained Neuromorphic Computation with High Accuracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the synergistic effect between ion migration barrier (Ea) and readout voltage (Vread), a stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current is achieved in a dual&#8208;terminal perovskite synapse. The gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs.








Abstract
Emerging neural morphological vision sensors inspired by biological systems that integrate image perception, memory, and information computing are expected to transform the landscape of machine vision and artificial intelligence. However, stable and reconfigurable light&#8208;induced synaptic behavior always relies on independent gateport modulation. Despite its potential, the limitations of uncontrollable defects and ionic characteristics have led to simpler, smaller, and more integration&#8208;friendly two&#8208;terminal devices being used as sidelines. In this work, the synergy between ion migration barriers and readout voltage is proven to be the key to realizing stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current in two&#8208;terminal devices. Following the same mechanism, optical and electrical signal synchronous triggering is proposed to serve as a preprocessing method to achieve a recognition accuracy of 96.5%. Impressively, the gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs. The PSC modulation potential under short optical pulse of 20 ns is also revealed. This optoelectronic device with perception, memory, and computation capabilities can promote the development of new devices for future photonic neural morphological circuits and artificial vision.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Enabled Printable Asymmetric Self&#8208;Insulated Stretchable Conductor for Human Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel printable, flexible material composed of conducting polymer and liquid metal, which is capable of self&#8208;assembly upon printing, producing asymmetric highly conductive stretchable conductors for human interface.








Abstract
Soft and stretchable conductors with high electrical conductivity and tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties are crucial for both on&#8208;skin and implantable electronic devices. Liquid metal&#8208;based conductors hold great promise due to their metallic conductivity and minimal stiffness. However, the surface oxidation of liquid metal particles in polymeric matrices poses a challenge in forming a continuous pathway for highly conductive elastic composites. Here, it is reported a printable composite material based on liquid metal and conducting polymer that undergoes a self&#8208;assembly process, achieving high conductivity (2089 S cm&#8722;1) in the bottom surface while maintaining an insulated top surface, high stretchability (&gt;800%), and a modulus akin to human skin tissue. This material is further applied to fabricate skin&#8208;interfaced strain sensors and electromyogram sensors through 3D printing.

         <title>Photothermal Mineralization of Polyolefin Microplastics via TiO2 Hierarchical Porous Layer&#8208;Based Semiwetting Air&#8208;Plastic&#8208;Solid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase system based on a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) is established. It boosts the photoexcitation and transfer of charge carriers and the interfacial diffusion of gaseous oxygen, greatly improving low&#8208;density polyethylene photothermal mineralization relative to a conventional diphase system. Investigations into micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano level wettability at air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces help unravel the interfacial diffusion&#8208;reaction process.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;mineralization of microplastics under mild conditions has emerged as a promising solution to plastic waste disposal. However, the inadequate contact between oxygen, water&#8208;insoluble polyolefin microplastics, and photocatalysts remains a critical issue. In this study, a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) photocatalyst is presented to establish air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase interfaces for the photothermal mineralization of polyolefins. The wettability of the TiO2&#8208;HPL&#8208;based triphase interface is finely controlled from plastophobic to plastophilic. High&#8208;resolution imaging and finite element simulation demonstrate the significance of a semiwetting state in achieving multidirectional oxygen diffusion through the hierarchical pore structure while maintaining sufficient contact between the plastic phase and photocatalysts. For low&#8208;density polyethylene, the TiO2&#8208;HPL achieves a photothermal mineralization rate of 5.63 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a conversion of 26.3% after 20 h of continuous irradiation. Additionally, the triphase photocatalytic system with semiwetting gas&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces shows good universality for various polyolefin reagents and products, illustrating its potential in achieving efficient photothermal mineralization of non&#8208;degradable microplastics.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Crack Formation on DNA Film via Organic Solvent&#8208;Induced Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orientation control is possible for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a hydrated state, and this affects to create cracks induced by drying. A method is for controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fractures through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID). The straightforward approach devised for aligning cracks has the potential for use in various patterning applications.








Abstract
Crack is found on the soil when severe drought comes, which inspires the idea to rationalize patterning applications using dried deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) film. DNA is one of the massively produced biomaterials in nature, showing the lyotropic liquid crystal (LC) phase in highly concentrated conditions. DNA nanostructures in the hydrated condition can be orientation controlled, which can be extended to make dryinginduced cracks. The controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fracture through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) is explored. The corresponding simulations show a strong correlation between the long axis of DNA due to the shrinkage during the dehydration and in the direction of crack propagation. The cracks are controlled by simple brushing and a 3D printing method. This facile way of aligning cracks will be used in potential patterning applications.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;stable high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheet (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS) photocatalyst capable of realizing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction is synthesized for the first time. The HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than all the single&#8208;metal MOFs due to the interplay between the different metals in the framework of the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS that enables more efficient charge transfer.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising platforms for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their fascinating physiochemical properties. Rationally engineering the compositions and structures of MOFs can provide abundant opportunities for their optimization. In recent years, high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have demonstrated great potential in the energy and environment fields. However, there is still no report on the development of high&#8208;entropy MOFs (HE&#8208;MOFs) for photocatalytic HER in aqueous solution. Herein, the authors report the synthesis of a novel p&#8208;type HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;single crystal (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC) and the corresponding HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;nanosheets (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS) capable of realizing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic HER. Both HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC and HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS exhibit higher photocatalytic HER activity than all the single&#8208;metal MOFs, which are supposed to be ascribed to the interplay between the different metal nodes in the HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;that enables more efficient charge transfer. Moreover, impressively, the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS demonstrates much higher photocatalytic activity than the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC due to its thin thickness and enhanced surface area. At optimum conditions, the rate of H2 evolution on the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS is &#8776;13.24 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is among the highest values reported for water&#8208;stable MOF photocatalysts. This work highlights the importance of developing advanced high&#8208;entropy materials toward enhanced photocatalysis.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesized Glucan Materials: Opportunities from Applied Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear d&#8208;glucans, simple yet versatile polysaccharides, shape nanostructures crucial for biomaterial development. Shifting from top&#8208;down to bottom&#8208;up synthesis using natural and engineered enzymes provides meticulous control over polymer structures, fostering diversification for macromolecular materials. This review introduces advancements in non&#8208;natural glucans, copolymers, and supramolecular hybrids, obtained through bottom&#8208;up enzymatic approaches. It emphasizes the potential of enzyme biocatalysis in material development.








Abstract
Linear d&#8208;glucans are natural polysaccharides of simple chemical structure. They are comprised of d&#8208;glucosyl units linked by a single type of glycosidic bond. Noncovalent interactions within, and between, the d&#8208;glucan chains give rise to a broad variety of macromolecular nanostructures that can assemble into crystalline&#8208;organized materials of tunable morphology. Structure design and functionalization of d&#8208;glucans for diverse material applications largely relies on top&#8208;down processing and chemical derivatization of naturally derived starting materials. The top&#8208;down approach encounters critical limitations in efficiency, selectivity, and flexibility. Bottom&#8208;up approaches of d&#8208;glucan synthesis offer different, and often more precise, ways of polymer structure control and provide means of functional diversification widely inaccessible to top&#8208;down routes of polysaccharide material processing. Here the natural and engineered enzymes (glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases and phosphorylases, glycosynthases) for d&#8208;glucan polymerization are described and the use of applied biocatalysis for the bottom&#8208;up assembly of specific d&#8208;glucan structures is shown. Advanced material applications of the resulting polymeric products are further shown and their important role in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials in a bio&#8208;based circular economy is discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;&#954; Dielectric (HfO2)/2D Semiconductor (HfSe2) Gate Stack for Low&#8208;Power Steep&#8208;Switching Computing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;quality gate stack (native HfO2 on 2D HfSe2) is proposed for future low&#8208;power computing applications. The proposed gate stack exhibits atomically sharp interface with suppressed gate leakage ensuring ideal operation (subthreshold slope (SS) &#8776; 60 mV dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, steep&#8208;switching operation (SS &#8776; 3.43 mV dec&#8722;1) overcoming the fundamental Boltzmann limit is demonstrated at room temperature with gated&#8208;region&#8208;controlled structure.








Abstract
Herein, a high&#8208;quality gate stack (native HfO2 formed on 2D HfSe2) fabricated via plasma oxidation is reported, realizing an atomically sharp interface with a suppressed interface trap density (Dit &#8776; 5 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2 eV&#8722;1). The chemically converted HfO2 exhibits dielectric constant, &#954; &#8776; 23, resulting in low gate leakage current (&#8776;10&#8722;3 A cm&#8722;2) at equivalent oxide thickness &#8776;0.5 nm. Density functional calculations indicate that the atomistic mechanism for achieving a high&#8208;quality interface is the possibility of O atoms replacing the Se atoms of the interfacial HfSe2 layer without a substitution energy barrier, allowing layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer oxidation to proceed. The field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistor&#8208;fabricated HfO2/HfSe2 gate stack demonstrates an almost ideal subthreshold slope (SS) of &#8776;61 mV dec&#8722;1 (over four orders of IDS) at room temperature (300 K), along with a high Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;108 and a small hysteresis of &#8776;10 mV. Furthermore, by utilizing a device architecture with separately controlled HfO2/HfSe2 gate stack and channel structures, an impact ionization field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated that exhibits n&#8208;type steep&#8208;switching characteristics with a SS value of 3.43 mV dec&#8722;1 at room temperature, overcoming the Boltzmann limit. These results provide a significant step toward the realization of post&#8208;Si semiconducting devices for future energy&#8208;efficient data&#8208;centric computing electronics.

         <title>Structurally Aligned Multifunctional Neural Probe (SAMP) Using Forest&#8208;Drawn CNT Sheet onto Thermally Drawn Polymer Fiber for Long&#8208;Term In Vivo Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP), which integrates forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets integrated onto thermally drawn polymer fibers, is presented with an emphasis on its manufacturing novelty and in vivo capabilities: 1) Easy fabrication techniques resulting in structurally aligned fiber implants; 2) Versatile and reliable in vivo performance; 3) Robust long&#8208;term operation in vivo system.








Abstract
Neural probe engineering is a dynamic field, driving innovation in neuroscience and addressing scientific and medical demands. Recent advancements involve integrating nanomaterials to improve performance, aiming for sustained in vivo functionality. However, challenges persist due to size, stiffness, complexity, and manufacturing intricacies.

         <title>Bacterial Biohybrids for Invasion of Tumor Cells Promote Antigen Cross&#8208;Presentation Through Gap Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bacterial biohybrid is designed by modifying live bacterium VNP20009 (VNP) with chito&#8208;oligosaccharide biopolymers to directly enter into tumor cells and bolster antigen cross&#8208;presentation through VNP&#8208;induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on tumor cells surface, which is achieved through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP.








Abstract
Due to inherent differences in cellular composition and metabolic behavior with host cells, tumor&#8208;harbored bacteria can discriminatorily affect tumor immune landscape. However, the mechanisms by which intracellular bacteria affect antigen presentation process between tumor cells and antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) are largely unknown. The invasion behavior of attenuated Salmonella VNP20009 (VNP) into tumor cells is investigated and an attempt is made to modulate this behavior by modifying positively charged polymers on the surface of VNP. It is found that non&#8208;toxic chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) modified VNP (VNP@COS) bolsters the formation of gap junction between tumor cells and APCs by enhancing the ability of VNP to infect tumor cells. On this basis, a bacterial biohybrid is designed to promote in situ antigen cross&#8208;presentation through intracellular bacteria induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the surface of tumor cells through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP@COS. This strategic integration serves to heighten the immunogenic exposure of tumor antigens; while, preserving the cytotoxic potency of T cells. A strategy is proposed to precisely controlling the function and local effects of microorganisms within tumors.

         <title>Transient Nanoscopy of Exciton Dynamics in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electronic and optical properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are dominated by strong excitonic resonances. Exciton dynamics plays a critical role in the functionality and performance of many miniaturized 2D optoelectronic devices; however, the measurement of nanoscale excitonic responses remains challenging. Here, a near&#8208;field transient nanoscopy is reported to probe exciton dynamics beyond the diffraction limit. Exciton recombination and exciton&#8208;exciton annihilation processes in monolayer and bilayer MoS2 are studied as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration. Moreover, with the capability to access local sites, intriguing exciton dynamics near the monolayer&#8208;bilayer interface and at the MoS2 nano&#8208;wrinkles are resolved. Such nanoscale resolution highlights the potential of this transient nanoscopy for fundamental investigation of exciton physics and further optimization of functional devices.

         <title>Revolutionizing Neurocare: Biomimetic Nanodelivery via Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Brain disorders represent a significant challenge in medical science due to the formidable blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which severely limits the penetration of conventional therapeutics, hindering effective treatment strategies. This review delves into the innovative realm of biomimetic nanodelivery systems, including stem cell&#8208;derived nanoghosts, tumor cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, and erythrocyte membrane&#8208;based carriers, highlighting their potential to circumvent the BBB's restrictions. By mimicking native cell properties, these nanocarriers emerge as a promising solution for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, offering a strategic advantage in overcoming the barrier's selective permeability. We evaluate the unique benefits of leveraging cell membranes from various sources and examine advanced technologies for fabricating cell membrane&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles capable of masquerading as endogenous cells. This enables the targeted delivery of a broad spectrum of therapeutic agents, ranging from small molecule drugs to proteins, thereby providing an innovative approach to neurocare. Furthermore, the review contrasts the capabilities and limitations of these biomimetic nanocarriers with traditional delivery methods, underlining their potential to enable targeted, sustained, and minimally invasive treatment modalities. We conclude with a perspective on the clinical translation of these biomimetic systems, underscoring their transformative impact on the therapeutic landscape for intractable brain diseases.

         <title>Super&#8208;Ionic Conductor Soft Filler Promotes Li+ Transport in Integrated Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Composite polymer solid electrolytes (CPEs), possessing good rigid&#8208;flexible, are expected to be used in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The integration of fillers into polymer matrices emerges as a dominant strategy to improve Li+ transport and form a Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. However, challenges arise as traditional fillers: (1) inorganic fillers, characterized by high interfacial energy, induce agglomeration; (2) organic fillers, with elevated crystallinity, impede intrinsic ionic conductivity, both severely hindering Li+ migration. Here, we introduce a concept of super&#8208;ionic conductor soft filler, utilizing a Li+ conductivity nano&#8208;cellulose (Li&#8208;NC) as a model, which exhibits super&#8208;ionic conductivity. Li&#8208;NC anchors anions, and enhance Li+ transport speed, and assists in the integration of cathode&#8208;electrolyte electrodes for room temperature solid&#8208;state batteries. The tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) with Li&#8208;NC and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) demonstrates a high Li+ transfer number (0.79) due to the synergistic coordination mechanism in Li+ transport. Integrated electrodes design enable stable performance in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li cells, with 720&#160;cycles at 0.5 C, and 88.8% capacity retention. Furthermore, the lifespan of Li|TDCT|Li cells over 4000&#160;h, and Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li cells exhibit excellent performance, proving the practical application potential of soft filler for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries at room temperature.

         <title>A Biohybrid Self&#8208;Dispersing Miniature Machine Using Wild Oat Fruit Awns for Reforestation and Precision Agriculture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advances in bioinspired and biohybrid robotics are enabling the creation of multifunctional systems able to explore complex unstructured environments. Inspired by Avena fruits, we report a biohybrid miniaturized autonomous machine (HybriBot) composed of a biomimetic biodegradable capsule as cargo delivery system and natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological motors. We employ micro&#8208;computed tomography, molding via two&#8208;photon polymerization and casting of natural awns into biodegradable materials to fabricate multiple HybriBots capable of exploring various soil and navigating soil irregularities, such as holes and cracks. These machines replicate the dispersal movements and biomechanical performances of natural fruits, achieving comparable capsule drag forces up to &#8776;0.38 N and awns torque up to &#8776;100 mN*mm. They were functionalized with fertilizer and have been successfully utilized to germinate selected diaspores. HybriBots function as self&#8208;dispersed systems with applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.

         <title>Self&#8208;lubricating, Living Contact Lenses</title>

Abstract
The increasing prevalence of dry eye syndrome in aging and digital societies compromises long&#8208;term contact lens wear and forces users to regular eye drop instillation to alleviate discomfort. Here we present a novel approach with the potential to improve and extend the lubrication properties of contact lenses. This is achieved by embedding lubricant&#8208;secreting biofactories within the contact lens material. The self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs autonomously produce and release hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural lubrication and wetting agent, long term. The hydrogel matrix regulates the growth of the biofactories and the HA production, and allows the diffusion of nutrients and HA for at least three weeks. The continuous release of HA sustainably reduces the friction coefficient of the contact lens surface. We present a self&#8208;lubricating contact lens prototype where the functional biofactories are contained in a functional ring at the lens periphery, outside of the vision area. The device is cytocompatible and fulfils physicochemical requirements of commercial contact lenses. The fabrication process is compatible with current manufacturing processes of contact lenses for vision correction. We envision that the durable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach in living contact lens could enable long term wear comfort for contact lens users and minimize the need for lubricating eye drops.

         <title>Orbital Electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;Dielectric for Droplet Manipulation on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric (EWOD), recognized as the most successful electrical droplet actuation method, is essential in diverse applications, ranging from thermal management to microfluidics and water harvesting. Despite significant advances, it remains challenging to achieve repeatability, high speed, and simple circuitry in EWOD&#8208;based droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces. Moreover, its efficient operation typically requires electrode arrays and sophisticated circuit control. Here, we report a newly observed droplet manipulation phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces with orbital EWOD (OEW). Due to the asymmetric electrowetting force generated on the orbit, flexible and versatile droplet manipulation is facilitated with OEW. We demonstrate that OEW droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces exhibits higher speed (up to 5 times faster), enhanced functionality (anti&#8208;gravity), and manipulation of diverse liquids (acid, base, salt, organic, e.g., methyl blue, artificial blood) without contamination, and good durability after 1000 tests. We envision that this robust droplet manipulation strategy using OEW would provide a valuable platform for various processes involving droplets, spanning from microfluidic devices to controllable chemical reactions. The previously unreported droplet manipulation phenomenon and control strategy shown in this study can potentially upgrade EWOD&#8208;based microfluidics, antifogging, anti&#8208;icing, dust removal, and beyond.

         <title>Emerging Antiferromagnets for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic spintronics has gained remarkable development in recent years. In this Perspective, the latest research progress in this field is reviewed. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can endow them with exotic properties for spintronics.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets constitute promising contender materials for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices with superior stability, scalability, and dynamics. Nevertheless, the perception of well&#8208;established ferromagnetic spintronics underpinned by spontaneous magnetization seemed to indicate the inadequacy of antiferromagnets for spintronics&#8212;their compensated magnetization has been perceived to result in uncontrollable antiferromagnetic order and subtle magnetoelectronic responses. However, remarkable advancements have been achieved in antiferromagnetic spintronics in recent years, with consecutive unanticipated discoveries substantiating the feasibility of antiferromagnet&#8208;centered spintronic devices. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can open up their endless possibilities of novel phenomena and functionality for spintronics. In this Perspective, the recent progress in antiferromagnetic spintronics is reviewed, with a particular focus on that based on several kinds of antiferromagnets with special antiferromagnetic crystal structures. The latest developments in efficiently manipulating antiferromagnetic order, exploring novel antiferromagnetic physical responses, and demonstrating prototype antiferromagnetic spintronic devices are discussed. An outlook on future research directions is also provided. It is hoped that this Perspective can serve as guidance for readers who are interested in this field and encourage unprecedented studies on antiferromagnetic spintronic materials, phenomena, and devices.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layer Controlled Transition from Inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein Effect to Inverse Spin Hall Effect in 2D PtSe2 Probed by THz Spintronic Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) is studied in 2D PtSe2 using THz emission. PtSe2 layers are grown epitaxially on graphene, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition resulting in well&#8208;defined atomic interfaces.The unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC: from the inverse RashbaEdelstein effect in the semiconducting layers to the inverse spin Hall effect in the semi&#8208;metallic state.








Abstract
2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, are ideal platforms for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) as they possess strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC), reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetries as well as tuneable band structure, compared to metallic structures. Moreover, SCC can be tuned with the number of layers, electric field, or strain. Here, SCC in epitaxially grown 2D PtSe2 by THz spintronic emission is studied since its 1T crystal symmetry and strong SOC favor SCC. High quality of as&#8208;grown PtSe2 layers is demonstrated, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition by sputtering that leaves the PtSe2 unaffected, resulting in well&#8208;defined clean interfaces as evidenced with extensive characterization. Through this atomic growth control and using THz spintronic emission, the unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC. Indeed, the transition from the inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effect (IREE) in 1&#8211;3 monolayers (ML) to the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in multilayers (&gt;3 ML) of PtSe2 enabling the extraction of the perpendicular spin diffusion length and relative strength of IREE and ISHE is demonstrated. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe2 an ideal candidate to explore the underlying mechanisms and engineering of the SCC as well as for the development of tuneable THz spintronic&#160;emitters.

         <title>Tailored Design of a Water&#8208;Based Nanoreactor Technology for Producing Processable Sub&#8208;40&#160;Nm 3D COF Nanoparticles at Atmospheric Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology that allows for the controlled generation of sub&#8208;40&#160;nm 3D covalent organic frameworks (COF) nanoparticles, boosting processability, and opening new frontiers in nano/microrobotics and biomedicine is presented. This breakthrough clearly overcomes the limitations posed by larger reported 3D COF crystal structures, unlocking exciting possibilities for previously unexplored domains.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline materials with intrinsic porosity that offer a wide range of potential applications spanning diverse fields. Yet, the main goal in the COF research area is to achieve the most stable thermodynamic product while simultaneously targeting the desired size and structure crucial for enabling specific functions. While significant progress is made in the synthesis and processing of 2D COFs, the development of processable 3D COF nanocrystals remains challenging. Here, a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology for producing processable sub&#8208;40&#160;nm 3D COF nanoparticles at ambient conditions is presented. Significantly, this technology not only improves the processability of the synthesized 3D COF, but also unveils exciting possibilities for their utilization in previously unexplored domains, such as nano/microrobotics and biomedicine, which are limited by larger crystallites.

Significantly, this technology not only improves the processability of the synthesized 3D COF, but also unveils exciting possibilities for their utilization in previously unexplored domains, such as nano/microrobotics and biomedicine, which are limited by larger crystallites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Architectured Silicones with Autonomic Self&#8208;Healing and Creep&#8208;Resistant Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Architectured silicones comprising vitrimer and conventional elastomers are developed to simultaneously achieve creep resistance and autonomic self&#8208;heal at room temperature. Self&#8208;healing capabilities arise from dynamic dioxaborolane groups in the silicone vitrimer, whereas creep resistance emerges from the permanently crosslinked conventional elastomer. The potential of architectured silicones is illustrated by 3D printing a patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers for prospective applications in robotics and medicine.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing silicones that are able to restore functionalities and extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications. However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self&#8208;heal or suffer from creep&#8208;induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, a platform is proposed to design and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and architecture levels to achieve self&#8208;healing at room temperature while simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self&#8208;healing vitrimers, whereas conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep&#8208;resistant elastomers. When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale, the layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks. A patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers are printed to demonstrate the potential of architectured silicones in creating damage&#8208;resilient functional devices using molecularly designed elastomer materials.

         <title>Mismatched Refractive Index Strategy for Fabricating Laser&#8208;Driven Wood Diffusers from Bulk Wood for Illumination Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers are prepared by impregnating porous delignified wood with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate with a mismatched refractive index to enhance scattering. The fabrication of laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers is simple, environment&#8208;friendly, and rapid. This low&#8208;cost and highly efficient strategy can provide substantial energy savings and a basis for the application of natural wood in emerging laser diode lighting technology.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;diode&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lighting is primarily used in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art illumination systems. However, these systems rely on light&#8208;converting inorganic phosphors, which have low quantum efficiencies and complex manufacturing conditions. In this study, a mismatched refractive index strategy is proposed to directly convert natural bulk wood into a laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser using a simple delignification and polymer infiltration method. The resulting material has the potential to be used in laser&#8208;driven diffuse illumination applications. The optical performance of the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is optimized by changing the density of natural wood. The optimal coefficient of illuminance variation of the wood diffuser is as low as 17.7%, which is significantly lower than that of commercial diffusers. The illuminance uniformity is larger than 0.9, which is significantly higher than the ISO requirements for indoor workplace lighting. The laser damage threshold is 7.9&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is considerably higher than those of the substrates of commercially available phosphors. Furthermore, the optimized wood diffuser exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, and low speckle contrast. These results show that the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is a promising laser&#8208;color converter that is suitable for indoor, long&#8208;distance outdoor, undersea, and other high&#8208;luminance laser lighting applications.

         <title>Pyroelectric Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelectrolyte brushes prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization display pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric behavior. These properties are attributed to the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and depend on, and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing. 








Abstract
Piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric materials are of interest, for example, for energy harvesting applications, for the development of tactile sensors, as well as neuromorphic computing. This study reports the observation of pyro&#8208; and piezoelectricity in thin surface&#8208;attached polymer brushes containing zwitterionic and electrolytic side groups that are prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. The pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric properties of the surface&#8208;grafted polyelectrolyte brushes are found to sensitively depend on and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The observed piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties reflect the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and are attributed to a complex interplay of the non&#8208;uniform segment density within these films, together with a non&#8208;uniform distribution of counterions and specific ion effects. The fabrication of thin pyroelectric films by surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is an important addition to the existing strategies toward such materials. Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, in particular, allows for facile grafting of polar thin polymer films from a wide range of substrates via a straightforward two&#8208;step protocol that obviates the need for multistep laborious synthetic procedures or thin film deposition protocols. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens up new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing.

         <title>Atmospheric Humidity Underlies Irreproducibility of Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atmospheric humidity control during the fabrication process crucially influences the phase formation and stability of formamidinium perovskites. This work reveals that controlled humidity during the fabrication process is a key to achieving reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality and stable perovskite films. Thus, precise humidity management is essential to ensure the reproducible, efficient, and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are infamous for their batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch and lab&#8208;to&#8208;lab irreproducibility in terms of stability and performance. Reproducible fabrication of PSCs is a critical requirement for market viability and practical commercialization. PSC irreproducibility plagues all levels of the community; from institutional research laboratories, start&#8208;up companies, to large established corporations. In this work, the critical function of atmospheric humidity to regulate the crystallization and stabilization of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is unraveled. It is demonstrated that the humidity content during processing induces profound variations in perovskite stoichiometry, thermodynamic stability, and optoelectronic quality. Almost counterintuitively, it is shown that the presence of humidity is perhaps indispensable to reproduce phase&#8208;stable and efficient FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Way to a Library of Ti&#8208;Series Oxide Nanofiber Sponges that are Highly Stretchable, Compressible, and Bendable</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Ti&#8208;series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability are synthesized, which hold extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices.








Abstract
Ti&#8208;series oxide ceramics in the form of aerogels, such as TiO2, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and CaCu3Ti4O12, hold tremendous potential as functional materials owing to their excellent optical, dielectric, and catalytic properties. Unfortunately, these inorganic aerogels are usually brittle and prone to pulverization owing to weak inter&#8208;particulate interactions, resulting in restricted application performance and serious health risks. Herein, a novel strategy is reported to synthesize an elastic form of an aerogel&#8208;like, highly porous structure, in which activity&#8208;switchable Ti&#8208;series oxide sols transform from the metastable state to the active state during electrospinning, resulting in condensation and solidification at the whipping stage to obtain curled nanofibers. These curled nanofibers are further entangled when flying in the air to form a physically interlocked, elastic network mimicking the microstructure of high&#8208;elasticity hydrogels. This strategy provides a library of Ti&#8208;series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability, possessing extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a new, elastic form of TiO2, composed of both &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; TiO2 nanofiber sponges, is constructed as spontaneous air&#8208;conditioning textiles in smart clothing, buildings, and vehicles, with unique bidirectional regulation of radiative cooling in summer and solar heating in winter.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Optical Detection and Elimination of Residual Microtumors with a Postoperative Implantable Hydrogel Sensor for Preventing Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A postoperative implantable hydrogel sensor integrating a molecular beacon (MB) nanoprobe and fibroblasts is designed for visual detection and elimination of residual microtumors by ultrasensitive in situ monitoring of trace biomarkers, whose amplification of the signal is achieved by fibroblast&#8208;mediated local enrichment of tumor cells and spatially selective release of exonuclease I (exo I)&#8208;triggered biomarker recycling.








Abstract
In vivo optical imaging of trace biomarkers in residual microtumors holds significant promise for cancer prognosis but poses a formidable challenge. Here, a novel hydrogel sensor is designed for ultrasensitive and specific imaging of the elusive biomarker. This hydrogel sensor seamlessly integrates a molecular beacon nanoprobe with fibroblasts, offering both high tissue retention capability and an impressive signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for imaging. Signal amplification is accomplished through exonuclease I&#8208;mediated biomarker recycling. The resulting hydrogel sensor sensitively detects the biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen with a detection limit of 1.8&#160;pg&#160;mL&#8722;1 in test tubes. Moreover, it successfully identifies residual cancer nodules with a median diameter of less than 2&#160;mm in mice bearing partially removed primary triple&#8208;negative breast carcinomas (4T1). Notably, this hydrogel sensor is proven effective for the sensitive diagnosis of invasive tumors in post&#8208;surgical mice with infiltrating 4T1 cells, leveraging the role of fibroblasts in locally enriching tumor cells. Furthermore, the residual microtumor is rapidly photothermal ablation by polydopamine&#8208;based nanoprobe under the guidance of visualization, achieving &#8776;100% suppression of tumor recurrence and lung metastasis. This work offers a promising alternative strategy for visually detecting residual microtumors, potentially enhancing the prognosis of cancer patients following surgical interventions.

         <title>Design of a Biohybrid Materials Circuit with Binary Decoder Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output decoder. The decoder is programmed to convert different combinations of two input signals into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information&#8208;processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and signal processing.








Abstract
Synthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information&#8208;processing circuits into materials. Here, a set of protease&#8208;based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited is engineered. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design&#8208;build&#8208;test&#8208;learn (DBTL) cycle, the modules are wired according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. A 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that can perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities is designed. The here demonstrated smart material system is strongly modular and can be used for biomolecular information processing for example in advanced biosensing or drug delivery applications.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Polymer Electrolyte Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The composite membrane with an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and PFPE rubber is fabricated by PFPE precursor diffusion into electrolyte membrane backbone and curing process. The membrane increases the fatigue threshold by a factor of 2.5 compared to Nafion membranes. In the fuel cell test, the composite membrane exhibits a lifespan of 1.7 times longer than Nafion membranes.








Abstract
In a hydrogen fuel cell, an electrolyte membrane conducts protons, but blocks electrons, hydrogen molecules, and oxygen molecules. The fuel cell often runs unsteadily, resulting in fluctuating water production, causing the membrane to swell and contract. The cyclic deformation can cause fatigue crack growth. This paper describes an approach to develop a fatigue&#8208;resistant polymer electrolyte membrane. The membrane is prepared by forming an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and a rubber. The former conducts protons, and the latter enhances fatigue resistance. The introduction of the rubber modestly reduces electrochemical performance, but significantly increases fatigue threshold and lifespan. Compared to pristine plastic electrolyte, Nafion, an interpenetrating network of Nafion and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) reduces the maximum power density by 20%, but increases the fatigue threshold by 175%. Under the wet/dry accelerated stress test, the fuel cell with the Nafion&#8208;PFPE membrane has a lifespan 1.7 times that of a fuel cell with the Nafion membrane.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Encapsulation Regulates Nephrogenesis in Kidney Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoid differentiation is largely conducted using biochemical signals to control cell differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signaling regulates nephrogenesis in kidney organoids is investigated. 3D encapsulation of differentiating kidney organoids in viscoelastic alginate hydrogels alters nephron patterning and morphology. These findings suggest that mechanical signaling is an important consideration for kidney regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoids contain nephron segments that recapitulate morphological and functional aspects of the human kidney. However, directed differentiation protocols for kidney organoids are largely conducted using biochemical signals to control differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signals regulate nephrogenesis is investigated in 3D culture by encapsulating kidney organoids within viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with varying rates of stress relaxation. Tubular nephron segments are significantly more convoluted in kidney organoids differentiated in encapsulating hydrogels when compared with those in suspension culture. Hydrogel viscoelasticity regulates the spatial distribution of nephron segments within the differentiating kidney organoids. Consistent with these observations, a particle&#8208;based computational model predicts that the extent of deformation of the hydrogel&#8211;organoid interface regulates the morphology of nephron segments. Elevated extracellular calcium levels in the culture medium, which can be impacted by the hydrogels, decrease the glomerulus&#8208;to&#8208;tubule ratio of nephron segments. These findings reveal that hydrogel encapsulation regulates nephron patterning and morphology and suggest that the mechanical microenvironment is an important design variable for kidney regenerative medicine.

         <title>Advanced Terahertz Refractive Sensing And Fingerprint Recognition Through Metasurface&#8208;Excited Surface Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz refractive sensing and fingerprint recognition within a continuous spectrum based on the coupling of surface waves. By covering 5 &#181;m thickness of polyimide, quartz, and silicon nitride layers, the phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176;, and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;sensitive metasurface&#8208;based sensors are essential for effective substance detection and insightful bio&#8208;interaction studies, which compress light in subwavelength volumes to enhance light&#8211;matter interactions. However, current methods to improve sensing performance always focus on optimizing near&#8208;field response of individual meta&#8208;atom, and fingerprint recognition for bio&#8208;substances necessitates several pixelated metasurfaces to establish a quasi&#8208;continuous spectrum. Here, a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz (THz) refractive sensing, and fingerprint recognition based on surface waves (SWs). Leveraging the long&#8208;range transmission, strong confinement, and interface sensitivity of SWs, a metasurface&#8208;supporting SWs excitation and propagation is experimentally verified to achieve sensing integrations. Through wide&#8208;band information collection of SWs, the proposed sensor not only facilitates refractive sensing up to 215.5&#176;/RIU, but also enables the simultaneous resolution of multiple fingerprint information within a continuous spectrum. By covering 5&#160;&#181;m thickness of polyimide, quartz and silicon nitride layers, the maximum phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176;, and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained within THz band, respectively. Thus, this strategy broadens the research scope of metasurface&#8208;excited SWs and introduces a novel paradigm for ultrasensitive sensing functions.

         <title>Hard Magnetic Graphene Nanocomposite for Multimodal, Reconfigurable Soft Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The HMGN combines the advantages of porous conductive materials and hard magnetic materials to enable multimodal, reconfigurable soft electronics with magnetism&#8208;enhanced sensing performance and magnetism&#8208;assisted electrical interconnection, allowing for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage.








Abstract
Soft electronics provide effective means for continuous monitoring of a diverse set of biophysical and biochemical signals from the human body. However, the sensitivities, functions, spatial distributions, and many other features of such sensors remain fixed after deployment and cannot be adjusted on demand. Here, laser&#8208;induced porous graphene is exploited as the sensing material, and dope it with permanent magnetic particles to create hard magnetic graphene nanocomposite (HMGN) that can self&#8208;assemble onto a flexible carrying substrate through magnetic force, in a reversible and reconfigurable manner. A set of soft electronics in HMGN exhibits enhanced performances in the measurements of electrophysiological signals, temperature, and concentrations of metabolites. All these flexible HMGN sensors can adhere to a carrying substrate at any position and in any spatial arrangement, to allow for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage. The HMGN represents a promising material for constructing soft electronics that can be reconfigured for various applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Adsorption on Magnetic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic helical aromatic hydrocarbons are sublimed in vacuo onto ferromagnetic cobalt nanoislands. Spin&#8208; and chirality&#8208;sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy on the single&#8208;molecule scale reveals that molecules of opposite handedness preferentially adsorb on islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. Enantioselection occurs in a transiently occupied physisorbed precursor state, suggesting that spin&#8208; and chirality&#8208;sensitive interactions at the van der Waals level play a role.








Abstract
From the beginning of molecular theory, the interplay of chirality and magnetism has intrigued scientists. There is still the question if enantiospecific adsorption of chiral molecules occurs on magnetic surfaces. Enantiomer discrimination was&#160;conjectured to arise from chirality&#8208;induced spin separation within the molecules and exchange interaction with the substrate's magnetization. Here, it is shown that single helical aromatic hydrocarbons undergo enantioselective adsorption on ferromagnetic cobalt surfaces. Spin and chirality sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that molecules of opposite handedness prefer adsorption onto cobalt islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. As mobility ceases in the final chemisorbed state, it is concluded that enantioselection must occur in a physisorbed transient precursor state. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spin&#8208;resolved ab initio simulations support this scenario by refuting enantio&#8208;dependent chemisorption energies. These findings demonstrate that van der Waals interaction should also include spin&#8208;fluctuations which are crucial for molecular magnetochiral&#160;processes.

         <title>Dynamic Li+ Capture through Ligand&#8208;Chain Interaction for the Regeneration of Depleted LiFePO4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the ligand chain within the Zn complex dynamically modulates the variational structure, enlarging the main framework of LFP and expediting the de&#8208;intercalation of Li+. This process revitalizes the composition, structure, and electrochemical performance of LFP, restoring them to levels comparable to that of newly produced LFP even under severe degradation conditions during the operation of regenerated batteries.








Abstract
After application in electric vehicles, spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries are typically decommissioned. Traditional recycling methods face economic and environmental constraints. Therefore, direct regeneration has emerged as a promising alternative. However, irreversible phase changes can significantly hinder the efficiency of the regeneration process owing to structural degradation. Moreover, improper storage and treatment practices can lead to metamorphism, further complicating the regeneration process. In this study, a sustainable recovery method is proposed for the electrochemical repair of LFP batteries. A ligand&#8208;chain Zn&#8208;complex (ZnDEA) is utilized as a structural regulator, with its &#9472;NH&#9472; group alternatingly facilitating the binding of preferential transition metal ions (Fe3+ during charging and Zn2+ during discharging). This dynamic coordination ability helps to modulate volume changes within the recovered LFP framework. Consequently, the recovered LFP framework can store more Li&#8208;ions, enhance phase transition reversibility between LFP and FePO4 (FP), modify the initial Coulombic efficiency, and reduce polarization voltage differences. The recovered LFP cells exhibit excellent capacity retention of 96.30% after 1500 cycles at 2&#160;C. The ligand chain repair mechanism promotes structural evolution to facilitate ion migration, providing valuable insights into the targeted ion compensation for environmentally friendly recycling in practical applications.

         <title>Conjugated Phosphonic Acids Enable Robust Hole Transport Layers for Efficient and Intrinsically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated phosphonic acid is developed to modify Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable device stability.








Abstract
High efficiency and long&#8208;term stability are the prerequisites for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, inadequate and non&#8208;uniform doping of hole transport layers (HTLs) still limits the efficiency improvements, while the intrinsic instability of HTLs caused by ion migration and accumulation is difficult to be addressed by external encapsulation. Here it is shown that the addition of a conjugated phosphonic acid (CPA) to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL can greatly enhance the device efficiency and intrinsic stability. Featuring an optimal diprotic&#8208;acid structure, indolo(3,2&#8208;b)carbazole&#8208;5,11&#8208;diylbis(butane&#8208;4,1&#8208;diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) is developed to promote morphological uniformity and mitigate ion migration across both perovskite/HTL and HTL/Ag interfaces, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable film stability. The dramatically improved interfacial charge collection endows BCZ&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.51%. More encouragingly, the BCZ&#8208;based devices demonstrate remarkable stability under harsh environmental conditions by retaining 90% of initial efficiency after 3000&#160;h in air storage. This work paves the way for further developing robust organic HTLs for optoelectronic devices.

Featuring an optimal diprotic-acid structure, indolo(3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;)carbazole-5,11-diylbis(butane-4,1-diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) is developed to promote morphological uniformity and mitigate ion migration across both perovskite/HTL and HTL/Ag interfaces, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable film stability. The dramatically improved interfacial charge collection endows BCZ-based n-i-p PSCs with a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.51%. More encouragingly, the BCZ-based devices demonstrate remarkable stability under harsh environmental conditions by retaining 90% of initial efficiency after 3000&#160;h in air storage. This work paves the way for further developing robust organic HTLs for optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Analogous Design of a Microlayered Silicon Oxide&#8208;Based Electrode to the General Electrode Structure for Thin&#8208;Film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>

SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes are designed similar to traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) slurry formulations, including active material, conductive agent, and binder. Using mid&#8208;frequency sputtering with a hybrid target containing SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene, a thin&#8208;film SiOx&#8208;based composite electrode is successfully fabricated within plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC). The SiOx/PPFC composite thin&#8208;film exhibits improved electronic conductivity, elasticity, and hardness compared to pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the SiOx/PPFC composite thin&#8208;film shows remarkable cycling stability.








Abstract
Development of miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs) using vacuum deposition techniques is crucial for low&#8208;scale applications, but addressing low energy density remains a challenge. In this work, structures analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes are designed with close resemblance to traditional LIB slurry formulations including active material, conductive agent, and binder. The thin&#8208;film is produced using mid&#8208;frequency sputtering with a single hybrid target consisting of SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene. The thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC (plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon) involves a combination of SiOx and conductive carbon within the PPFC matrix. This results in enhanced electronic conductivity and superior elasticity and hardness in comparison to a conventional pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the half&#8208;cell consisting of thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 74.8% up to the 1000th cycle at 0.5 C. In addition, a full cell using the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 thin&#8208;film as the cathode material exhibits an exceptional initial capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and cycle performance, marked by a capacity retention of 90.8% from the first cycle to the 500th cycle at a 1 C rate. This work will be a stepping stone for the AM/CB/B composite electrodes in TF&#8208;LIBs.

         <title>B&#8208;Site Co&#8208;Doping Coupled with Additive Passivation Pushes the Efficiency of Pb&#8211;Sn Mixed Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Over 17%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pb&#8211;Sn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells with a record efficiency of 17.12% are achieved via B&#8208;site Mn co&#8208;doping strategy and introducing benzhydroxamic acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. Mn&#8208;doping contributes to structurally stable inorganic perovskite. While, BHA additive mitigates Sn2+ oxidation, and passivates Sn(II) related defects, forming an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite.








Abstract
Pb&#8211;Sn mixed inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered increasing interest as a viable solution to mitigate the thermal instability and lead toxicity of hybrid lead&#8208;based PSCs. However, the relatively poor structural stability and low device efficiency hinder its further development. Herein, high&#8208;performance manganese (Mn)&#8208;doped Pb&#8211;Sn&#8211;Mn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are successfully developed by introducing Benzhydroxamic Acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. The incorporation of smaller divalent Mn cations contributes to a contraction of the perovskite crystal, leading to an improvement in structural stability. The BHA additive containing a reductive hydroxamic acid group (O&#9552;C&#8211;NHOH) not only mitigates the notorious oxidation of Sn2+ but also interacts with metal ions at the B&#8208;site and passivates related defects. This results in films with high crystallinity and low defect density. Moreover, the BHA molecules tend to introduce a near&#8208;vertical dipole moment that parallels the built&#8208;in electric field, thus facilitating charge carrier extraction. Consequently, the resulting device delivers a champion PCE as high as 17.12%, which represents the highest reported efficiency for Pb&#8211;Sn&#8208;based inorganic PSCs thus far. Furthermore, the BHA molecule provides an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite grain boundary, resulting in significant enhancement of device air stability.

         <title>Piezoelectric Interlayer Enabling a Rechargeable Quasisolid&#8208;State Sodium Battery at 0&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric interlayer design between an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte and sodium metal is demonstrated to solve the interfacial issues against low&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. A piezoelectric ZnO layer proves a favorable interlayer with matched modulus, high Na&#8208;adhesion, sufficient piezoelectricity to thoroughly reduce the interfacial resistance and promote a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na2MnFe(CN)6&#8208;based full cell operating at a harsh condition of 0 &#176;C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) batteries (SSNBs) hold great promise but suffer from several major issues, such as high interfacial resistance at the solid electrolyte/electrode interface and Na metal dendrite growth. To address these issues, a piezoelectric interlayer design for an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) solid electrolyte is proposed herein. Two typical piezoelectric films, AlN and ZnO, coated onto NZSP function as interlayers designed to generate a local stress&#8208;induced field for alleviating interfacial charge aggregation coupling stress concentration and promoting uniform Na plating. The results reveal that the interlayer (ZnO) with matched modulus, high Na&#8208;adhesion, and sufficient piezoelectricity can provide a favorable interphase. Low interfacial resistances of 91 and 239 &#937; cm2 are achieved for the ZnO layer at 30 and 0&#160;&#176;C, respectively, which are notably lower than those for bare NZSP. Moreover, steady Na plating/stripping cycles are rendered over 850 and 4900&#160;h at 0 and 30&#160;&#176;C, respectively. The superior anodic performance is further manifested in an Na2MnFe(CN)6&#8208;based full cell which delivers discharge capacities of 125&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 over 1600 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C and 90&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 0&#160;&#176;C. A new interlayer&#8208;design insight is clearly demonstrated for SSNBs breaking low&#8208;temperature limits.

The inability to process many covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as thin films plagues their widespread utilization. Herein, a vapor&#8208;phase pathway for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a class of porphyrin&#8208;based COFs is presented. This approach allows integrating electrocatalysts made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;containing COFs into the electrodes&#8217; architectures in a single&#8208;step synthesis and deposition. By precisely controlling the metal sites at the atomic level, remarkable electrocatalytic performance is achieved, resulting in unprecedentedly high mass activity values. How the choice of metal atoms, i.e., cobalt and copper, can determine the catalytic activities of POR&#8208;COFs is demonstrated. The theoretical data proves that the Cu site is highly active for nitrate conversion to ammonia on the synthesized COFs.

&lt;p&gt;A solvent-free pathway for synthesizing metal-containing porphyrin-based Covalent Organic Frameworks (MPOR-COFs) is presented. The roles of synthetic conditions and the transition metals chelating with porphyrin are highlighted through both experimental and computational works. This study sets forth a unique approach to the synthesis and integration of electrocatalysts into electrode architectures, propelling applications into the cutting-edge realm.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact Solar Cell Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides two features that may enhance experimental studies and evaluations on TOPCon solar cells technology: 1) the compilation of a dataset built from current literature, and: 2) a series of rules on cell performance and heuristics for optimization that are obtained based on this dataset, which could serve as a source of inspiration for further experimental studies.








Abstract
Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have gained interest as a way to increase the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and the International Technology Roadmap of Photovoltaics forecasts TOPCon to become an important technology despite a few remaining challenges. To review the recent development of TOPCon cells, this work has compiled a dataset of all device data found in current literature, which sums up to 405 devices from 131 papers. This may seem like a surprisingly small number of cells given the recent interest in the TOPCon architecture, but it illustrates a problem of data dissemination in the field. Notwithstanding the limited number of cells, there is a great diversity in cell manufacturing procedures, and this work observes a gradual increase in performance indicating that the field has not yet converged on a set of best practices. By analyzing the data using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms, this work is able to reinforces some commonly held hypotheses related to the performance differences between different device architectures. This work also identifies a few more unintuitive feature combinations that would be of interest for further experimentally studies. This work also aims to inspire improvements in data management and dissemination within the TOPCon community.

         <title>Transient Mild Photothermia Improves Therapeutic Performance of Oral Nanomedicines with Enhanced Accumulation in the Colitis Mucosa</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral medications for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) encounter challenges of insufficient drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. A high&#8208;performance gold shell&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutic is constructed to achieve mucus penetration, improve wound healing, relieve oxidative stress, and reduce inflammatory responses under transient mild photothermia. Oral hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating nanotherapeutics plus transient mild photothermia efficiently alleviates acute and chronic UC.








Abstract
The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, high&#8208;performance pluronic F127 (P127)&#8208;modified gold shell (AuS)&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR) is constructed. Under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the resultant P127&#8208;AuS@CURs generate transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8776;42&#160;&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitates their penetration through colonic mucus and favors multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieves intracellular oxidative stress, improves wound healing, and reduces immune responses by polarizing the proinflammatory M1&#8208;type macrophages to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating P127&#8208;AuS@CURs plus intestinal intralumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127&#8208;AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevates the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites can also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with antioxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intralumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Excitable AIE Small Molecule with Multimodal Phototheranostic Features for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR&#8208;II light activatable AIE small molecule with multimodal phototheranostic features is constructed for the first time by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility, as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. This molecule actualizes prominent NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT&#8208;PTT synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors.








Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics, referring to a single component simultaneously exhibiting multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities, has attracted significant attention due to its excellent performance in cancer treatment. Benefitting from the superiority in balancing the diverse competing energy dissipation pathways, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are proven to be ideal templates for constructing one&#8208;for&#8208;all multimodal phototheranostic agents. However, to this knowledge, the all&#8208;round AIEgens that can be triggered by a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) light have not been reported. Given the deep tissue penetration and high maximum permissible exposure of the NIR&#8208;II excitation light, herein, this work reports for the first time an NIR&#8208;II laser excitable AIE small molecule (named BETT&#8208;2) with multimodal phototheranostic features by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. As formulated into nanoparticles (NPs), the high performance of BETT&#8208;2 NPs in NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors is fully demonstrated by the systematic in vitro and in vivo evaluations.

         <title>Efficient Thermo&#8208;Spin Conversion in van der Waals Ferromagnet FeGaTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative thermo&#8208;spin conversion has been found in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe. The unique thermoelectric property, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in opposite directions under a temperature gradient, produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature. The maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient is found to reach 440 nV&#160;K&#8722;1 with a notable Nernst angle over 60%. 








Abstract
Recent discovery of 2D van der Waals magnetic materials has spurred progress in developing advanced spintronic devices. A central challenge lies in enhancing the spin&#8208;conversion efficiency for building spin&#8208;logic or spin&#8208;memory devices. Here, the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects are systematically investigated to uncover significant spin&#8208;conversion effects in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The anomalous Hall effect demonstrates an efficient electric spin&#8208;charge conversion with a notable spin Hall angle of over 6%. In addition, the anomalous Nernst effect produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature without a magnetic field, displaying unique temperature dependence with a maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient of 440 nV&#160;K&#8722;1 and a Nernst angle of &#8776;62%. Such an innovative thermoelectric signal arises from the efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion effect, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in opposite directions under a temperature gradient. The present study highlights the potential of FeGaTe to enhance thermoelectric devices through efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion without the need for a magnetic&#160;field.

         <title>Ultraviolet Light Debondable Optically Clear Adhesives for Flexible Displays through Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Curing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;removable optically clear adhesive (OCA) is introduced, ideal for the sustainability&#8208;focused electronics industry, particularly for foldable devices requiring easy disassembly and robust, eco&#8208;friendly materials.








Abstract
With growing sustainability concerns, the need for products that facilitate easy disassembly and reuse has increased. Adhesives, initially designed for bonding, now face demands for selective removal, enabling rapid assembly&#8208;disassembly and efficient maintenance across industries. This need is particularly evident in the display industry, with the rise of foldable devices necessitating specialized adhesives. A novel optically clear adhesive (OCA) is presented for foldable display, featuring a unique UV&#8208;stimulated selective removal feature. This approach incorporates benzophenone derivatives into the polymer network, facilitating rapid debonding under UV irradiation. A key feature of this method is the adept use of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical polymerization for OCA film fabrication. This method shows remarkable compatibility with various monomers and exhibits orthogonal reactivity to benzophenone, rendering it ideal for large&#8208;scale production. The resultant OCA not only has high transparency and balanced elasticity, along with excellent resistance to repeated folding, but it also exhibits significantly reduced adhesion when exposed to UV irradiation. By merging this customized formulation with strategically integrated UV&#8208;responsive elements, an effective solution is offered that enhances manufacturing efficiency and product reliability in the rapidly evolving field of sustainable electronics and displays. This research additionally contributes to eco&#8208;friendly device fabrication, aligning with emerging technology demands.

         <title>How to Build Plasmon&#8208;Driven Molecular Jackhammers that Disassemble Cell Membranes and Cytoskeletons in Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular jackhammers (MJH) are a type of molecular machine driven by a molecular plasmon that converts photons into mechanical energy. The theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon&#8208;driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here these are quantified through an experimental plasmonicity index method. This method is utilized to understand how to improve plasmon&#8208;driven MJH for permeabilizing cellular membranes.








Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;driven molecular machines with ultrafast motion at the femtosecond scale are effective for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. It is recently shown that cyanine dyes act as molecular jackhammers (MJH) through vibronic (vibrational and electronic mode coupling) driven activation that causes the molecule to stretch longitudinally and axially through concerted whole molecule vibrations. However, the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon&#8208;driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here the use of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated plasmons in a broad array of MJH that mechanically disassemble membranes and cytoskeletons in human melanoma A375 cells is described. The characteristics of plasmon&#8208;driven molecular mechanical disassembly of supramolecular biological structures are observed and recorded using real&#8208;time fluorescence confocal microscopy. Molecular plasmon resonances in MJH are quantified through a new experimental plasmonicity index method. This is done through the measurement of the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR spectra in various solvents, and quantification of the optical response as a function of the solvent polarity. Structure&#8208;activity relationships are used to optimize the synthesis of plasmon&#8208;driven MJH, applying them to eradicate human melanoma A375 cells at low lethal concentrations of 75&#160;nm and 80&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 of 730&#160;nm NIR&#8208;light for 10&#160;min.

         <title>Observation of a Photonic Orbital Gauge Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital gauge field is constructed by a rotational defect on an atom&#8208;like lattice and shows a generalized and appealing perspective to control the behaviors of particles. The Hall&#8208;like transport of high&#8208;dimensional quantum states with protected orbital angular momentum represents a step toward generalized and large&#8208;scale quantum engineering.








Abstract
Gauge field is widely studied in natural and artificial materials. With an effective magnetic field for uncharged particles, many intriguing phenomena are observed in several systems like photonic Floquet topological insulator. However, previous researches about the gauge field mostly focus on limited dimensions such as the Dirac spinor in graphene materials. Here, an orbital gauge field based on photonic triangular lattices is first proposed and experimentally observed. Disclination defects with Frank angle &#937; created on such lattices breaks the original lattice symmetry and generates purely geometric gauge field operating on orbital basis functions. Interestingly, it is found that bound states near zero energy with the orbital angular momentum (OAM) l = 2 are intensively confined at the disclination as gradually expanding &#937;. Moreover, the introduction of a vector potential field breaks the time&#8208;reversal symmetry of the orbital gauge field, experimentally manifested by the chiral transmission of light on helical waveguides. The orbital gauge field further suggests fantastic applications of manipulating the vortex light in photonic integrated&#160;devices.

         <title>Rewritable Photoluminescence and Structural Color Display for Dual&#8208;Responsive Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration and light intensity&#8208;tunable photoluminescence are independently and reliably manipulated in the thin polymer&#8208;based film. A rewritable dual&#8208;responsive encryption display that has the benefit of direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information by the human eye is presented, enabling high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Optical encryption using coloration and photoluminescent (PL) materials can provide highly secure data protection with direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information. Encryption capable of independently controlling wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration as well as variable light intensity PL is not adequately demonstrated yet. Herein, a rewritable PL and structural color (SC) display suitable for dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption developed with a stimuli&#8208;responsive SC of a block copolymer (BCP) photonic crystal (PC) with alternating in&#8208;plane lamellae, of which a variety of 3D and 2D perovskite nanocrystals is preferentially self&#8208;assembled with characteristic PL, is presented. The SC of a BCP PC is controlled in the visible range with different perovskite precursor doping times. The perovskite nanocrystals developed in the BCP PC are highly luminescent, with a PL quantum yield of &#8776;33.7%, yielding environmentally stable SC and PL dual&#8208;mode displays. The independently programmed SC and PL information is erasable and rewritable. Dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption is demonstrated, in which true Morse code information is deciphered only when the information encoded by SCs is properly combined with PL information. Numerous combinations of SC and PL realize high security level of data anticounterfeiting. This dual&#8208;mode encryption display offers novel optical encryption with high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Localization of Cancer Cells for Subsequent Robust Photodynamic Therapy by ROS Responsive Polymeric Nanoparticles With Anti&#8208;Metastasis Complexes NAMI&#8208;A</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most cancer&#8208;related deaths are caused by tumor metastasis. This study pioneers a new photodynamic therapy that can precisely target the primary tumor while capable of halting tumor metastasis, enabling the siege of highly metastatic triple&#8208;negative breast tumors and providing a promising paradigm for the treatment of highly metastatic cancers.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a new type of light&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) cancer therapy, has the advantages of high therapeutic efficiency, non&#8208;resistance, and less trauma than traditional cancer therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, oxygen&#8208;dependent PDT further exacerbates tumor metastasis. To this end, a strategy that circumvents tumor metastasis to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT is proposed. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated photosensitive polymer is synthesized and branched the anti&#8208;metastatic ruthenium complex NAMI&#8208;A on the side, which is further assembled to form nanoparticles (NP2) for breast cancer therapy. NP2 can kill tumor cells by generating ROS under 808&#160;nm radiation (NP2 + L), reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) in cancer cells, decrease the invasive and migration capacity of cancer cells, and eliminate cancer cells. Further animal experiments show that NP2 + L can inhibit tumor growth and reduce liver and lung metastases. In addition, NP2 + L can activate the immune system in mice to avoid tumor recurrence. In conclusion, a PDT capable of both preventing tumor metastasis and precisely hitting the primary tumor to achieve effective treatment of highly metastatic cancers is developed.

&lt;p&gt;Most cancer-related deaths are caused by tumor metastasis. This study pioneers a new photodynamic therapy that can precisely target the primary tumor while capable of halting tumor metastasis, enabling the siege of highly metastatic triple-negative breast tumors and providing a promising paradigm for the treatment of highly metastatic cancers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a new type of light-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) cancer therapy, has the advantages of high therapeutic efficiency, non-resistance, and less trauma than traditional cancer therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, oxygen-dependent PDT further exacerbates tumor metastasis. To this end, a strategy that circumvents tumor metastasis to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT is proposed. Herein, a near-infrared light-activated photosensitive polymer is synthesized and branched the anti-metastatic ruthenium complex NAMI-A on the side, which is further assembled to form nanoparticles (NP2) for breast cancer therapy. NP2 can kill tumor cells by generating ROS under 808&#160;nm radiation (NP2 + L), reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) in cancer cells, decrease the invasive and migration capacity of cancer cells, and eliminate cancer cells. Further animal experiments show that NP2 + L can inhibit tumor growth and reduce liver and lung metastases. In addition, NP2 + L can activate the immune system in mice to avoid tumor recurrence. In conclusion, a PDT capable of both preventing tumor metastasis and precisely hitting the primary tumor to achieve effective treatment of highly metastatic cancers is developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Angular Engineering Strategy for Enhanced Surface Nonlinear Frequency Conversion in Centrosymmetric Topological Semimetal HfGe0.92Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface nonlinearity is essential for integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. Topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te possesses a giant surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility and exhibits unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) based on an angular engineering strategy. Moreover, this high&#8208;performance SHG response is observed ranging from the visible to deep&#8208;UV regions because of the wide linear dispersion region around the Dirac points.








Abstract
Surface nonlinear optics are essential for developments in integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. However, the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency on a surface is restricted by the finite nonlinear susceptibility of matter and the intrinsic atomic&#8208;layered interaction length between light and matter. In this work, based on an angular engineering strategy, it is demonstrated that the centrosymmetric topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te crystal has a giant and anisotropic surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility up to 5535 &#177; 308&#160;pm V&#8722;1 and exhibits efficient and unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). The maximum optical conversion efficiency is found to be up to 3.75&#8240;, which is 104 times higher than that obtained from a silicon surface. Because of the linear dispersion over a wide range of energies around the Dirac points, this high conversion efficiency can be maintained with SHG wavelengths ranging from the visible region (779&#160;nm) to the deep&#8208;UV region (257.5&#160;nm). This study can facilitate the development of topological photonics and integrated nonlinear photonics based on topological semimetals.

         <title>Capacitive&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Scaffolds Offering Wireless In Situ Electrical Stimulation Promotes Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the capacitive coupling configuration, the electrostatic induction response of the chitosan/gelatin/black phosphorus conductive hydrogel implanted in the spinal cord injury lesion site can offer in situ electrical stimulation without any external metal stimulation electrodes and percutaneous electrical wirings. The capacitive coupling of high&#8208;frequency electrical field between hydrogel receiver and insulated metal patch transmitter can generate alternating current flowing in the hydrogel scaffold.








Abstract
Electrical stimulation (ES) has shown beneficial effects in repairing injured tissues. However, current ES techniques that use tissue&#8208;traversing leads and bulky external power suppliers have significant limitations in translational medicine. Hence, exploring noninvasive in vivo ES to provide controllable electrical cues in tissue engineering is an imminent necessity. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with in situ electrical generation capability as a biodegradable regeneration scaffold and wireless ES platform for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair is demonstrated. When a soft insulated metal plate is placed on top of the injury site as a wireless power transmitter, the conductive hydrogel implanted at the injury site can serve as a wireless power receiver, and the capacitive coupling between the receiver and transmitter can generate an alternating current in the hydrogel scaffold owing to electrostatic induction effect. In a complete transection model of SCI rats, the implanted conductive hydrogels with capacitive&#8208;coupling in situ ES enhance functional recovery and neural tissue repair by promoting remyelination, accelerating axon regeneration, and facilitating endogenous neural stem cell differentiation. This facile wireless&#8208;powered electroactive&#8208;hydrogel strategy thus offers on&#8208;demand in vivo ES with an adjustable timeline, duration, and strength and holds great promise in translational medicine.

         <title>Electrically Confined Electroluminescence of Neutral Excitons in WSe2 Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates electrically confined electroluminescence of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs). By balancing injected electrons and holes, and electrically confining neutral excitons, WSe2 LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing efficiency and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have drawn significant attention for their potential in optoelectronic applications due to their direct band gap and exceptional quantum yield. However, TMD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices have shown low external quantum efficiencies as imbalanced free carrier injection often leads to the formation of non&#8208;radiative charged excitons, limiting practical applications. Here, electrically confined electroluminescence (EL) of neutral excitons in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) based on the van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. The WSe2 channel is locally doped to simultaneously inject electrons and holes to the 1D region by a local graphene gate. At balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, the WSe2 LETs exhibit strong EL with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. These experimental and theoretical results consistently show that the enhanced EQE could be attributed to dominant exciton emission confined at the 1D region while expelling charged excitons from the active area by precise control of external electric fields. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing the EQE of 2D light&#8208;emitting transistors and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for excitonic devices.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Surface&#8208;Mediated Mechanochemical Reaction for Rapid and Scalable Manufacture of Perovskite QD Phosphors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reaction (PMR) is proposed to prepare highly luminescent perovskite quantum dots (QDs) for the first time. PMR possesses distinctive features, including a high material utilization rate (100%), rapid synthesis (&#8776;100 s), mass production (synthesis rate of 1&#160;kg&#160;min&#8722;1), solvent&#8208;free, and remarkable versatility in preparing various perovskites, aligning with the ultimate goal of mechanochemistry: A clean, safe, and efficient solvent&#8208;free strategy.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered new&#8208;generation emitters for lighting and displays due to their high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency, and pure color. However, their commercialization process is currently hindered by the challenge of mass production in a quick and environmentally friendly manner. In this study, a polymer&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reaction (PMR) is proposed to prepare perovskite QDs using a high&#8208;speed multifunction grinder for the first time. PMR possesses two distinctive features: i) The ultra&#8208;high rotating speed (&gt;15&#8239;000&#160;rpm) of the grinder facilitates the rapid conversion of the precursor to perovskite; ii) The surface&#8208;rich polymer particulate ensures QDs with high dispersity, avoiding QD aggregation&#8208;induced PL quenching. Therefore, PMR can successfully manufacture green perovskite QDs with a high PL quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 90% in a highly material&#8208; (100% yield), time&#8208; (1&#160;kg&#160;min&#8722;1), and effort&#8208; (solvent&#8208;free) efficient manner. Moreover, the PMR demonstrates remarkable versatility, including synthesizing by various polymers and producing diverse colored and Pb&#8208;free phosphors. Importantly, these phosphors featuring a combination of polymer and perovskite, are facilely processed into various solid emitters. The proposed rapid, green, and scalable approach has great potential to accelerate the commercialization of perovskite QDs.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis inside Double&#8208;Shelled Nanocages with Separated and Tunable Atomic Catalyst Sites for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages with separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites are developed as nano reactors to trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of lithium polysulfides. These nanocages can serve as multifunctional sulfur hosts for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, guaranteeing admirable rate performance and high stability in battery cycling.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic catalysts are effective in mitigating the shuttling effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, but their ideal performance has yet to be achieved due to the multi&#8208;step conversion of LiPSs requiring multifunctional active sites for tandem catalysis. Here double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages (DSNCs) have been developed to address this challenge, featuring separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites as nano reactors that trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. This enables high capacity and durable Li&#8208;S batteries. The DSNCs, with inner Co&#8208;N4 and outer Zn&#8208;N4 sites (S/CoNC@ZnNC DSNCs), exhibit a high specific capacity of 1186 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, along with a low capacity fading rate of 0.063% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm&#8722;2) and a low E/S ratio (6 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), the cell displays excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the Li&#8208;S pouch cells are capable of stable cycling for more than 160 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of driving successive sulfur conversion reactions with separated active sites, and are expected to inspire further catalyst design for high performance Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Proton Conductor for Fuel Cells with Flexible Operational Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A developed dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid and phosphoric acid exhibits efficient and stable proton conductivity over 80&#8211;160 &#176;C owing to the strong interaction between the two proton conductors and enhanced proton dissociation, enabling fuel cell operation with a flexible temperature range and excellent stability.








Abstract
The properties of proton conductors determine the operating temperature range of fuel cells. Typically, phosphoric acid (PA) proton conductors exhibit excellent proton conductivity owing to their high proton dissociation and self&#8208;diffusion abilities. However, at low temperatures or high current densities, water&#8208;induced PA loss causes rapid degradation of cell performance. Maintaining efficient and stable proton conductivity within a flexible temperature range can significantly reduce the start&#8208;up temperature of PA&#8208;doped proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this study, a dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of an organic phosphonic acid (ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, EDTMPA) and an inorganic PA is developed for proton exchange membranes. The proposed dual&#8208;proton conductor can operate within a flexible temperature range of 80&#8211;160 &#176;C, benefiting from the strong interaction between EDTMPA and PA, and the enhanced proton dissociation. Fuel cells with the EDTMPA&#8208;PA dual&#8208;proton conductor showed excellent cell stability at 80 &#176;C. In particular, under the high current density of 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 160 &#176;C, the voltage decay rate of the fuel cell with the dual&#8208;proton conductor is one&#8208;thousandth of that of the fuel cell with PA&#8208;only proton conductor, indicating excellent stability.

         <title>Upconversion 3D Bioprinting for Noninvasive In Vivo Molding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel technique for creating implantable medical devices using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;assisted 3D bioprinting. By converting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons into blue&#8211;violet emission, UCNPs enable in vivo polymerization without invasive surgery. Successful 3D bioprinting of a noninvasive fracture fixation scaffold demonstrates the potential of this method for biomedical treatment.








Abstract
Tissue engineered bracket materials provide essential support for the physiological protection and therapeutics of patients. Unfortunately, the implantation process of such devices poses the risk of surgical complications and infection. In this study, an upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;assisted 3D bioprinting approach is developed to realize in vivo molding that is free from invasive surgery. Reasonably designed UCNPs, which convert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons that penetrate skin tissues into blue&#8211;violet emission (300&#8211;500 nm), induce a monomer polymerization curing procedure in vivo. Using a fused deposition modeling coordination framework, a precisely predetermined trajectory of the NIR laser enables the manufacture of implantable medical devices with tailored shapes. A proof of the 3D bioprinting of a noninvasive fracture fixation scaffold is achieved successfully, thus demonstrating an entirely new method of in vivo molding for biomedical treatment.

         <title>Inhibition of Vanadium Cathodes Dissolution in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathode dissolution significantly limits the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, particularly at low currents. An artificial constructed on V6O13 cathodes (ZnOTf&#8208;LDH) is revealed to repel water, impede vanadium shuttling, and facilitate zinc transport. This suppresses vanadium dissolution and enables stable cycling for over 200 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1. The method is applicable to different vanadium oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have experienced a rapid surge in popularity, as evident from the extensive research with over 30 000 articles published in the past 5 years. Previous studies on AZIBs have showcased impressive long&#8208;cycle stability at high current densities, achieving thousands or tens of thousands of cycles. However, the practical stability of AZIBs at low current densities (&lt;1C) is restricted to merely 50&#8211;100 cycles due to intensified cathode dissolution. This genuine limitation poses a considerable challenge to their transition from the laboratory to the industry. In this study, leveraging density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an artificial interphase that achieves both hydrophobicity and restriction of the outward penetration of dissolved vanadium cations, thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium and suppressing the vanadium dissolution following Le Chatelier's principle, is described. The approach has resulted in one of the best cycling stabilities to date, with no noticeable capacity fading after more than 200 cycles (&#8776;720&#160;h) at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 (0.47C). These findings represent a significant advance in the design of ultrastable cathodes for aqueous batteries and accelerate the industrialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively and efficiently from brine sources is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. The electrochemical system employing LiMn2O4 (LMO) electrodes has been recognized as an effective method for lithium recovery. However, the lithium selectivity and stability of LMO need further enhancement for its practical applications. Herein, the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant is successfully fabricated through a facile one&#8208;step solid&#8208;state sintering method, leading to enhanced lithium selectivity. The reduced lattice constant in Al&#8208;doped LMO is proved through spectroscopic analyses and theoretic calculations. Compared to the original LMO, the Al&#8208;doped LMO (LiAl0.05Mn1.95O4, LMO&#8208;Al0.05) exhibits highercapacitance, lower resistance, and improved stability. Moreover, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 with reduced lattice constant can offer higher Li+ diffusion coefficient and lower intercalation energy revealed by cyclic voltammetry and multiscale simulations. When employed in hybrid capacitive deionization (CDI), the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 obtains a Li+ intercalation capacity of 21.7&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 and low energy consumption of 2.6&#160;Wh&#160;mol&#8722;1 Li+. Importantly, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 achieves a high Li+ extraction percentage (&#8776;86%) with Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of 1653.8 and 434.9, respectively, in synthetic brine. The results demonstrate that the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant could be a sustainable solution for electrochemical lithium extraction.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Li2S Cathodes Enabled by an In Situ&#8208;Formed Li+ Conductor for Graphite&#8208;Li2S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ formed Li+ conductor (Li4SnS4) layer is directly constructed on commercial Li2S particles to obtain air&#8208;stable, shuttle&#8208;free, and fast&#8208;redox Li2S cathodes for graphite&#8208;Li2S batteries.








Abstract
Using Li2S cathodes instead of S cathodes presents an opportunity to pair them with Li&#8208;free anodes (e.g., graphite), thereby circumventing anode&#8208;related issues, such as poor reversibility and safety, encountered in Li&#8208;S batteries. However, the moisture&#8208;sensitive nature of Li2S causes the release of hazardous H2S and the formation of insulative by&#8208;products, increasing the manufacturing difficulty and adversely affecting cathode performance. Here, Li4SnS4, a Li+ conductor that is air&#8208;stable according to the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle, is formed in situ and uniformly on Li2S particles because Li2S itself participates in Li4SnS4 formation. When exposed to air (20% relative humidity), the protective Li4SnS4 layer maintains its components and structure, thus contributing to the enhanced stability of the Li2S@Li4SnS4 composite. In addition, the Li4SnS4 layer can accelerate the sluggish conversion of Li2S because of its favorable interfacial charge transfer, and continuously confine lithium polysulfides owing to its integrity during electrochemical processes. A graphite&#8208;Li2S pouch cell containing a Li2S@Li4SnS4 cathode is constructed, which shows stable cyclability with 97% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Hence, combining a desirable air&#8208;stable Li2S cathode and a highly reversible Li&#8208;free configuration offers potential practical applications of graphite&#8208;Li2S full cells.

         <title>In Situ Reconstruction of High&#8208;Entropy Heterostructure Catalysts for Stable Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cr&#8208;induced in situ reconstruction strategy is proposed to construct robust FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts for highly stable oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. Benefiting from its desired electronic states, the FeCoNiMnCr HEA&#8208;HEO catalyst exhibits negligible activity loss under harsh industrial condition (6&#160;m KOH and 85&#160;&#176;C) at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 500&#160;h. 








Abstract
Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, a successful in situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy is reported, and it is demonstrated that they deliver excellent ultrastable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 240&#160;h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6&#160;m KOH and 85&#160;&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 500&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Abstract
The first synthesis and comprehensive characterization of two vinyl tetrazine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COF), TA&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and TA&#8208;COF&#8208;2, are reported. These materials exhibit high crystallinity and high specific surface areas of 1323 and 1114 m2 g&#8722;1. The COFs demonstrate favorable band positions and narrow band gaps suitable for light&#8208;driven applications. These advantages enable TA&#8208;COFs to act as reusable metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in the arylboronic acids oxidation and light&#8208;induced coupling of benzylamines. In addition, these TA&#8208;COFs show acid sensing capabilities, exhibiting visible and reversible color changes upon exposure to HCl&#160;solution, HCl vapor, and NH3 vapor. Further, the TA&#8208;COFs outperform a wide range of previously reported COF photocathodes. The tetrazine linker in the COF skeleton represents a significant advancement in the field of COF synthesis, enhancing the separation efficiency of charge carriers during the photoreaction and contributing to their photocathodic properties. TA&#8208;COFs can also degrade 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;one (NTO), an insensitive explosive present in industrial wastewater, in 20 min in a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic process; thus, revealing dual functionality of the protonated TA&#8208;COFs as both photodegradation and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts. This pioneering work opens new avenues for harnessing the potential of the tetrazine linker in COF&#8208;based materials, facilitating advances in catalysis, sensing, and other related fields.

Porifera&#8208;inspired lightweight, thin, wrinkle&#8208;resistant, and multifunctional MXene foam. Schematic illustration of the fabrication, structure, multifunction, and potential application of porifera&#8208;inspired MXene foam.








Abstract
Transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) demonstrate a massive potential in constructing lightweight, multifunctional wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields for application in various fields. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to develop a facile, scalable approach to prepare the MXene&#8208;based macrostructures characterized by low density, low thickness, high mechanical flexibility, and high EMI SE at the same time. Herein, the ultrathin MXene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ag foams with a porifera&#8208;inspired hierarchically porous microstructure are prepared by combining Zn2+ diffusion induction and hard template methods. The hierarchical porosity, which includes a mesoporous skeleton and a microporous MXene network within the skeleton, not only exerts a regulatory effect on stress distribution during compression, making the foams rubber&#8208;like resistant to wrinkling but also provides more channels for multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves. Due to the interaction between Ag nanosheets, MXene/rGO, and porous structure, it is possible to produce an outstanding EMI shielding performance with the specific surface shielding effectiveness reaching 109152.4&#160;dB&#160;cm2&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the foams exhibit multifunctionalities, such as transverse Joule heating, longitudinal heat insulation, self&#8208;cleaning, fire resistance, and motion detection. These discoveries open up a novel pathway for the development of lightweight MXene&#8208;based materials with considerable application potential in wearable electromagnetic anti&#8208;interference devices.

         <title>Electron Localization&#8208;Triggered Proton Pumping Toward Cu Single Atoms for Electrochemical CO2 Methanation of Unprecedented Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of electron transfer and directional *H transport enabled by electron localization is developed. VBi as an initiator can induce the electron localization at Cu single atoms, which enhances the adsorption and activation of CO2 in single&#8208;atom Cu sites for electrocatalytic CH4 synthesis of unprecedented selectivity, apart from acting as active sites of H2O dissociation and pumping proton.








Abstract
Slow multi&#8208;proton coupled electron transfer kinetics and unexpected desorption of intermediates severely hinder the selectivity of CO2 methanation. In this work, a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of pumping protons and improving adsorption configuration/capability enabled by electron localization is developed to be highly efficient for CH4 electrosynthesis over Cu single atoms anchored on bismuth vacancies of BiVO4 (Bi1&#8208;xVO4&#9472;Cu), with superior kinetic isotope effect and high CH4 Faraday efficiency (92%), far outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation. Control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the bismuth vacancies (VBi) not only act as active sites for H2O dissociation but also induce electron transfer toward Cu single&#8208;atom sites. The VBi&#8208;induced electron localization pumps *H from VBi sites to Cu single atoms, significantly promoting the generation and stabilization of the pivotal intermediate (*CHO) for highly selective CH4 electrosynthesis. The metal vacancies as new initiators show enormous potential in the proton transfer&#8208;involved hydrogenative conversion processes.

         <title>Dynamic Transition between Monomer and Excimer Phosphorescence in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel phosphors are developed by the modification of dithienopyrrole, exhibiting efficient and persistent near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence. At low temperatures, excimer phosphorescence can be activated, enabled by the enhanced noncovalent interactions. With environmental variations, the dynamic transition process between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence is captured, establishing a framework to understand the photophysical mechanisms governing organic phosphorescence.








Abstract
Achieving efficient near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of purely organic phosphors remains scarce and challenging due to strong nonradiative decay. Additionally, the investigation of triplet excimer phosphorescence is rarely reported, despite the fact that excimer, a special emitter commonly formed in crystals with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, can efficiently change the fluorescent properties of compounds. Herein, a series of dithienopyrrole derivatives with low triplet energy levels and stable triplet states, exhibiting persistent near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, is developed. Via the modification of halogen atoms, the crystals display tunable emissions of monomers from 645 to 702&#160;nm, with a maximum lifetime of 3.68&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Notably, excimer phosphorescence can be switched on at low temperatures, enabled by noncovalent interactions rigidifying the matrix and stabilizing triplet excimer. Unprecedentedly, the dynamic transition process is captured between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence with temperature variations, revealing that the unstable triplet excimers in crystals with a tendency to dissociate can result in the effective quench of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Excited state transitions across varying environments are elucidated, interpreting the structural dynamics of the triplet excimer and demonstrating strategies for devising novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors.

         <title>Comparative Proteomics Inspired Self&#8208;Stimulated Release Hydrogel Reinforces the Therapeutic Effects of MSC&#8208;EVs on Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here an intelligent hydrogel containing self&#8208;assembled peptides that mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle (MSC&#8208;EV) membrane enzymes can degrade is developed to allow controlled release of MSC&#8208;EVs after intranasal delivery, prolonging their retention and improving their ability to cure Alzheimer's disease. This study introduces a comparative proteomics&#8208;driven hydrogel design, offering promising modality for MSC&#8208;EVs&#8217; clinical applications.









Abstract
The clinical application of extracellular vesicles (EVs)&#8208;based therapeutics continues to be challenging due to their rapid clearance, restricted retention, and low yields. Although hydrogel possesses the ability to impede physiological clearance and increase regional retention, it typically fails to effectively release the incorporated EVs, resulting in reduced accessibility and bioavailability. Here an intelligent hydrogel in which the release of EVs is regulated by the proteins on the EVs membrane is proposed. By utilizing the EVs membrane enzyme to facilitate hydrogel degradation, sustained retention and self&#8208;stimulated EVs release can be achieved at the administration site. To achieve this goal, the membrane proteins with matrix degrading activity in the mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;EVs) are identified using comparative proteomics. After that, a hydrogel comprised of self&#8208;assembled peptides that are susceptible to degradation by the membrane enzymes present in MSC&#8208;EVs is designed and synthesized. After intranasal administration, this peptide hydrogel facilitates sustained and thermo&#8208;sensitive release of MSC&#8208;EVs, thereby extending the retention of the MSC&#8208;EVs and substantially enhancing their potential for treating Alzheimer's disease. This research presents a comparative proteomics&#8208;driven approach to intelligent hydrogel design, which holds the capacity to significantly enhance the applicability of EVs in clinical settings.

         <title>Light and Magnetism Orchestrating Aquatic Pollutant&#8208;Degradation Robots in Programmable Trajectories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart aquatic superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled composite heterojunction minerals is developed based on the liquid film&#8208;confined strategy. Taking advantage of the remarkable photothermal and magnetic properties, the aquatic robot exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient navigation in broad range of surface tensions, and the purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ by the synergistic orchestration of light and magnetism.








Abstract
Interfacial floating robots have promising applications in carriers, environmental monitoring, water treatment, and so on.

&lt;p&gt;A smart aquatic superhydrophobic robot integrated with well-assembled composite heterojunction minerals is developed based on the liquid film-confined strategy. Taking advantage of the remarkable photothermal and magnetic properties, the aquatic robot exhibits ultra-efficient navigation in broad range of surface tensions, and the purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ by the synergistic orchestration of light and magnetism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfacial floating robots have promising applications in carriers, environmental monitoring, water treatment, and so on. Even though, engineering smart robots with both precisely efficient navigation and elimination of water pollutants in long term remains a challenge, as the superhydrophobicity greatly lowers resistance for aquatic motion while sacrificing chemical reactivity of the surface. Here, a pollutant-removing superhydrophobic robot integrated with well-assembled iron oxide-bismuth sulfide heterojunction composite minerals, which provide both light and magnetic propulsion, and the ability of catalytic degradation, is reported. The motion velocity of the robot reaches up to 51.9&#160;mm s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; within only 300&#160;ms of acceleration under the orchestration of light, and brakes rapidly (&#8776;200&#8211;300&#160;ms) once turn off the light. And magnetism extends the robot to work in broad range of surface tensions in any programmable trajectory. Besides, purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ and the degradation efficiency exhibits eightfold enhancements under the effect of light-triggered photothermal behavior coupled with magnetic induction, overcoming the dilemma of efficient motion with catalytic superhydrophobicity.

         <title>ACE2 Receptor&#8208;Targeted Inhaled Nanoemulsions Inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Attenuate Inflammatory Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;modified inhaled nanoemulsions (NEs) are developed, which can target the Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway epithelial cells. The inhaled remdesivir NEs inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and replication. The inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice.








Abstract
Three kinds of coronaviruses are highly pathogenic to humans, and two of them mainly infect humans through Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 &#65288;ACE2&#65289;receptors. Therefore, specifically blocking ACE2 binding at the interface with the receptor&#8208;binding domain is promising to achieve both preventive and therapeutic effects of coronaviruses. Alternatively, drug&#8208;targeted delivery based on ACE2 receptors can further improve the efficacy and safety of inhalation drugs. Here, these two approaches are innovatively combined by designing a nanoemulsion (NE) drug delivery system (termed NE&#8208;AYQ) for inhalation that targets binding to ACE2 receptors. This inhalation&#8208;delivered remdesivir nanoemulsion (termed RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) effectively inhibits the infection of target cells by both wild&#8208;type and mutant viruses. The RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ strongly inhibits Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at two dimensions: they not only block the binding of the virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restrict virus replication intracellularly. Furthermore, in the mouse model of acute lung injury, the inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (TPCA&#8208;1&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice. This smart combination provides a new choice for dealing with possible emergencies in the future and for the rapid development of inhaled drugs for the treatment of respiratory diseases.

         <title>Delineating the Impact of Transition&#8208;Metal Crossover on Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation with Ion Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals that cross over from the cathode and deposit on the lithium&#8208;metal anode during high&#8208;voltage cycling (4.6&#160;V) are shown to localize solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and lithium deposition on cycled lithium&#8208;metal anodes through advanced, high&#8208;resolution 3D chemical analysis conducted with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS).








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMB) employing cobalt&#8208;free layered&#8208;oxide cathodes are a sustainable path forward to achieving high energy densities, but these cathodes exhibit substantial transition&#8208;metal dissolution during high&#8208;voltage cycling. While transition&#8208;metal crossover is recognized to disrupt solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on graphite anodes, experimental evidence is necessary to demonstrate this for lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, advanced high&#8208;resolution 3D chemical analysis is conducted with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) to establish spatial correlations between the transition metals and electrolyte decomposition products found on cycled lithium&#8208;metal anodes. Insights into the localization of various chemistries linked to crucial processes that define LMB performance, such as lithium deposition, SEI growth, and transition&#8208;metal deposition are deduced from a precise elemental and spatial analysis of the SEI. Heterogenous transition&#8208;metal deposition is found to perpetuate both heterogeneous SEI growth and lithium deposition on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. These correlations are confirmed across various lithium&#8208;metal anodes that are cycled with different cobalt&#8208;free cathodes and electrolytes. An advanced electrolyte that is stable to higher voltages is shown to minimize transition&#8208;metal crossover and its effects on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of maintaining uniform SEI coverage on lithium&#8208;metal anodes, which is disrupted by transition&#8208;metal crossover during operation at high voltages.

         <title>Topological Engineering Electrodes with Ultrafast Oxygen Transport for Super&#8208;Power Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore&#8208;clogging and poor O2 diffusion restrict the output power and capacity of sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries. Here, by using 3D&#8208;printing techniques, the impact of porous structures and pore sizes on O2 diffusion in sodium&#8208;oxygen cells is studied. An electrode is 3D printed with progressively branching gas channels to balance O2 diffusion and product storage, which shows a high output power and capacity.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1NaO2) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm&#8722;2) and superior output power. Herein, 3D&#8208;printing technology is adopted to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size, and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density of up to 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm&#8722;2. The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries toward practical applications.

         <title>Reversing Zincophobic/Hydrophilic Nature of Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C via Metal&#8208;Coordination Interaction for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode with High Depth&#8208;of&#8208;Discharge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of traditional Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C is ingeniously reversed through manipulating electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms and the novel zincophilic/hydrophobic Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host for Zn anode is fabricated. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host benefits the dendrite&#8208;free and durable cyclic stability of Zn anode under high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge.








Abstract
Dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes with high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DoD) and robust cycle performances are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C through manipulating the electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms is successfully reversed, thereby fabricating a zincophilic/hydrophobic asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C (consisting of a Zn center coordinated with 3 pyridinic N atoms and 1 pyrrolic N atom) host, which realizes uniformed Zn deposition and a long lifespan with high DoD. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate weakened interaction between pyrrolic N and metal center in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C triggers downshift of the Zn 3d&#8208;band&#8208;center and a new localization nonbonding state in the N and C 2p&#8208;band, resulting in preferred Zn adsorption to water adsorption. Consequently, the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host delivers small Zn nucleation overpotential and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% over 500 cycles. The symmetric cells with Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn anode demonstrate 500&#160;h dendrite&#8208;free cycles at DoD up to 50%. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn/S&#8208;PANI full cell also shows a robust long&#8208;term cycle performance of 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This strategy of constructing zincophilic/hydrophobic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C may open up their application for the dendrite&#8208;free metal anode.

     alt="Reversing Zincophobic/Hydrophilic Nature of Metal-N-C via Metal-Coordination Interaction for Dendrite-Free Zn Anode with High Depth-of-Discharge"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of traditional Metal-N-C is ingeniously reversed through manipulating electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms and the novel zincophilic/hydrophobic Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C host for Zn anode is fabricated. The Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C host benefits the dendrite-free and durable cyclic stability of Zn anode under high depth-of-discharge.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendrite-free Zn metal anodes with high depth-of-discharge (DoD) and robust cycle performances are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous Zn-ion batteries. Herein, the zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of Metal-N-C through manipulating the electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms is successfully reversed, thereby fabricating a zincophilic/hydrophobic asymmetric Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C (consisting of a Zn center coordinated with 3 pyridinic N atoms and 1 pyrrolic N atom) host, which realizes uniformed Zn deposition and a long lifespan with high DoD. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate weakened interaction between pyrrolic N and metal center in the asymmetric Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C triggers downshift of the Zn 3d-band-center and a new localization nonbonding state in the N and C 2p-band, resulting in preferred Zn adsorption to water adsorption. Consequently, the asymmetric Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C host delivers small Zn nucleation overpotential and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% over 500 cycles. The symmetric cells with Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C@Zn anode demonstrate 500&#160;h dendrite-free cycles at DoD up to 50%. The Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C@Zn/S-PANI full cell also shows a robust long-term cycle performance of 1000 cycles at 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This strategy of constructing zincophilic/hydrophobic Metal-N-C may open up their application for the dendrite-free metal anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastrong and High Thermal Insulating Porous High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics up to 2000&#160;&#176;C</title>

         <dc:description>
A multiscale design strategy is proposed to fabricate 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diborides (9PHEBs) with exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulating performance via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique. The as&#8208;fabricated 9PHEBs possess ultrahigh compressive strength (&#8776;337 MPa) and low thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.76 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). More importantly, they show superior thermal stability and strength retention up to 2000 &#176;C.








Abstract
High mechanical load&#8208;carrying capability and thermal insulating performance are crucial to thermal&#8208;insulation materials under extreme conditions. However, these features are often difficult to achieve simultaneously in conventional porous ceramics. Here, for the first time, it is reported a multiscale structure design and fast fabrication of 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diboride ceramics via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique that can lead to exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulation performance. With the construction of multiscale structures involving ultrafine pores at the microscale, high&#8208;quality interfaces between building blocks at the nanoscale, and severe lattice distortion at the atomic scale, the materials with an &#8776;50% porosity exhibit an ultrahigh compressive strength of up to &#8776;337&#160;MPa at room temperature and a thermal conductivity as low as &#8776;0.76&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. More importantly, they demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, with merely &#8776;2.4% volume shrinkage after 2000&#160;&#176;C annealing. They also show an ultrahigh compressive strength of &#8776;690&#160;MPa up to 2000&#160;&#176;C, displaying a ductile compressive behavior. The excellent mechanical and thermal insulating properties offer an attractive material for reliable thermal insulation under extreme conditions.

         <title>Ionic Polyimine&#8208;Based Composite Membrane with Inductive and Complexation Synergistic Effects for Sensitive and On&#8208;Site Fluorescent Detection of Volatile Iodine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concerns about radioactive iodine emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage are raised. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;based method using an ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone composite membrane is developed for on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by utilizing ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions and complexation effects for iodine enrichment and immobilization. The resulting membrane shows rapid response time and low detection limit.








Abstract
Along with the development of nuclear power, concerns about radioactive emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage have been widely raised, particularly of harmful iodine isotopes. However, as a significant component of nuclear air waste, the enrichment and detection of air&#8208;dispersed gaseous iodine remain a challenge. In this work, it is focused on developing an attraction&#8208;immobilization&#8208;detection strategy&#8208;based fluorescence method for the on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by employing a photoluminescent ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone (IPIN&#8208;PVP) composite membrane. This strategy synergizes ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions from IPIN and complexation effects from PVP, allowing effective iodine enrichment and immobilization. As a result, the optimized IPIN&#8208;PVP membrane exhibits rapid response times of 5 s and a low detection limit of 4.087 &#215; 10&#8722;8&#160;m for gaseous iodine. It also introduces a portable handheld detection device that utilizes the composite membrane, offering a practical solution for real&#8208;time on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine. This innovation enhances nuclear safety measures and disaster management by providing rapid and reliable iodine detection capabilities.

         <title>Injectable MSC Spheroid and Microgel Granular Composites for Engineering Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel microparticles and mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids are combined into granular composites to engineer cartilage tissue. The spheroids allow for important cell&#8211;cell interactions during chondrogenesis and fusion into a cartilage tissue, whereas the granular structure allows for injectability and then stabilization through interparticle crosslinking. This approach advances the use of engineered biomaterials for tissue engineering applications.








Abstract
Many cell types require direct cell&#8211;cell interactions for differentiation and function; yet, this can be challenging to incorporate into 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures for the engineering of tissues. Here, a new approach is introduced that combines aggregates of cells (spheroids) with similarly&#8208;sized hydrogel particles (microgels) to form granular composites that are injectable, undergo interparticle crosslinking via light for initial stabilization, permit cell&#8211;cell contacts for cell signaling, and allow spheroid fusion and growth. One area where this is important is in cartilage tissue engineering, as cell&#8211;cell contacts are crucial to chondrogenesis and are missing in many tissue engineering approaches. To address this, granular composites are developed from adult porcine mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) spheroids and hyaluronic acid microgels and simulations and experimental analyses are used to establish the importance of initial MSC spheroid to microgel volume ratios to balance mechanical support with tissue growth. Long&#8208;term chondrogenic cultures of granular composites produce engineered cartilage tissue with extensive matrix deposition and mechanical properties within the range of cartilage, as well as integration with native tissue. Altogether, a new strategy of injectable granular composites is developed that leverages the benefits of cell&#8211;cell interactions through spheroids with the mechanical stabilization afforded with engineered hydrogels.

         <title>Defect Engineering of 2D Semiconductors for Dual Control of Emission and Carrier Polarity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical calculations, a general defect engineering strategy is designed to eliminate the negative influence of defects in 2D TMDCs monolayers and achieve the desired optoelectronic properties. The doped samples simultaneously achieve giant PL/PLQY enhancement and effective carrier polarity modulation. Further constructed p&#8208;n homojunctions also shows excellent device performance. 








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are considered as promising materials in post&#8208;Moore technology. However, the low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and single carrier polarity due to the inevitable defects during material preparation are great obstacles to their practical applications. Here, an extraordinary defect engineering strategy is reported based on first&#8208;principles calculations and realize it experimentally on WS2 monolayers by doping with IIIA atoms. The doped samples with large sizes possess both giant PLQY enhancement and effective carrier polarity modulation. Surprisingly, the high PL emission maintained even after one year under ambient environment. Moreover, the constructed p&#8211;n homojunctions shows high rectification ratio (&#8776;2200), ultrafast response times and excellent stability. Meanwhile, the doping strategy is universally applicable to other TMDCs and dopants. This smart defect engineering strategy not only provides a general scheme to eliminate the negative influence of defects, but also utilize them to achieve desired optoelectronic properties for multifunctional applications.

Meanwhile, the doping strategy is universally applicable to other TMDCs and dopants. This smart defect engineering strategy not only provides a general scheme to eliminate the negative influence of defects, but also utilize them to achieve desired optoelectronic properties for multifunctional applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution of Grain Boundaries Promoted Hydrogen Production for Industrial&#8208;Grade Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of grain boundaries via Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo) leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density (0.5 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.12 V), which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C.








Abstract
The development of efficient and durable high&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen production electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale production of green hydrogen and the early realization of hydrogen economic blueprint. Herein, the evolution of grain boundaries through Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo), which leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution process (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density, is successfully driven. The optimal MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo demonstrates ultrahigh current density (&gt;2 A cm&#8722;2) at a smaller overpotential in 1&#160;m KOH (572&#160;mV), than that of BNiMo, which does not have lattice strain. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo with optimal lattice strain generated more electrophilic Mo sites with partial oxidation owing to accelerated charge transfer from Cu to Mo, which lowers the energy barriers for H* adsorption. These synergistic effects lead to the enhanced HER performance of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo. More importantly, industrial application of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo operated in alkaline electrolytic cell is also determined, with its current density reached 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.12&#160;V and 0.1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.79&#160;V, which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C. The strategy provides valuable insights for achieving industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production through a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds&#8208;Pinned Entanglement Blunting the Interfacial Crack of Hydrogel&#8211;Elastomer Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a universal strategy to blunt the interfacial crack propagation by bonding a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8211;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomer. Such a unique strategy fulfills the hydrogel coating with excellent interfacial toughness and interfacial fatigue threshold, ensuring long&#8208;term durable aqueous lubrication with a low friction coefficient.








Abstract
Anchoring a layer of amorphous hydrogel on an antagonistic elastomer holds potential applications in surface aqueous lubrication. However, the interfacial crack propagation usually occurs under continuous loads for amorphous hydrogel, leading to the failure of hydrogel interface. This work presents a universal strategy to passivate the interfacial cracks by designing a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8211;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomers. The unique Hb&#8211;En structure is created by pinning well&#8208;tailored entanglements via covalent&#8208;like hydrogen bonds, which can amplify the delocalization of interfacial stress concentration and elevate the necessary fracture energy barrier within hydrogel interface. Therefore, the interfacial crack propagation can be suppressed under single and cyclic loads, resulting in a high interfacial toughness over 1650 J m&#8722;2 and an excellent interfacial fatigue threshold of 423 J m&#8722;2. Such a strategy universally works on blunting the interfacial crack between hydrogel coating and various elastomer materials with arbitrary shapes. The superb fatigue&#8208;crack insensitivity at the interface allows for durable aqueous lubrication of hydrogel coating with low friction.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adaptive Pyroptosis Inducer: Optimizing the Catalytic Microenvironment of Nanozymes by Membrane&#8208;Adhered Microbe Enables Potent Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer to optimize catalytic performance of nanozyme by the respiration of membrane&#8208;adhered microbe, which induces eruptive ROS to trigger pyroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy. The utilization of self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer will motivate the development of self&#8208;adaptive nano&#8208;catalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy and provide new insights into the treatments of other diseases.








Abstract
Pyroptosis has garnered increasing attention in cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, increasing plasma membrane damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered an effective strategy for promoting pyroptosis. However, the current tactics for enhancing membrane rupture in pyroptosis are limited by the inherent drawbacks of ROS and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer (LPZ) is designed by integrating Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and an enzyme&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework to achieve potent pyroptosis immunotherapy. LPZ can adhere to cancer cell membranes through the interaction between the pili of LGG and the mucin of cancer cells. In particular, the adaptive formula can gradually enhance the ability of nanozymes to produce ROS by creating an acidic microenvironment through anaerobic respiration. These results verify that LPZ could generate high levels of ROS both on the membrane and within cancer cells, leading to pyroptotic cell death and strong antitumor immunity. Meanwhile, LGG are eventually killed by ROS in this process to halt their respiration and prevent potential biosafety concerns. Overall, this work provides new inspiration for the design of self&#8208;adaptive nanocatalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Biphasic GaIn Alloy Constructed Stable Percolation Network in Polymer Composites over Ultrabroad Temperature Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;eutectic biphasic design of GaIn alloy not only maintains the conductive network integrity at a wide temperature range (77&#8211;473 K) by phase transitions of liquid Ga and solid In but also addresses the widespread leakage problem. This work provides a feasible indication of conductive composites for applications in extreme temperature applications.








Abstract
Flexible and adaptable polymer composites with high&#8208;performance reliability over wide temperature range are imperative for various applications. However, the distinct filler&#8208;matrix thermomechanical behaviors often cause severe structure damage and performance degradation upon large thermal shock. To address this issue, a general strategy is proposed to construct leakage&#8208;free, self&#8208;adaptive, stable percolation networks in polymer composites over wide temperature (77&#8211;473 K) with biphasic Ga35In65 alloy. The in situ micro&#8208;CT technology, for the first time, reveals the conformable phase transitions of Ga35In65 alloys in the polymer matrix that help repair the disruptive conductive networks over large temperature variations. The cryo&#8208;expanded Ga compensates the disruptive carbon networks at low temperatures, and flowable Ga and melted In at high temperatures conformably fill and repair the deboned interfaces and yielded crevices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this temperature&#8208;resistant composite demonstrates superb electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference shielding properties and stability even after a large temperature shock (&#916;T = 396 K). Furthermore, the superiority of the construction of temperature self&#8208;adaptive networks within the composite enables them for additive manufacturing of application&#8208;oriented components. This work offers helpful inspiration for developing high&#8208;performance polymer composites for extreme&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Protein&#8208;Escaping Dyes Enable High&#8208;Contrast and Long&#8208;Term Prognosis Evaluation of Flap Transplantation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;escaping dyes are designed to exhibit a low affinity for serum proteins, allowing them to avoid in situ covalent binding with proteins while maintaining much&#8208;enhanced imaging contrast. These dyes enable short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging, serving as a noninvasive and reliable method for monitoring flap viability after transplantation.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time vascular positioning, postoperative flap monitoring, and vascular reconstruction assessment are of great importance in flap transplantation. Cyanine dyes offer the advantage of high resolution in the Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;imaging window. However, the nonspecific binding of many cyanine dyes to endogenous albumin leads to high organ accumulation and skin absorption, resulting in low&#8208;quality imaging and poor reproducibility of contrast during long&#8208;term (e.g., 7 days) postoperative monitoring. Here, a novel strategy is proposed that can be widely applied to prevent protein binding for NIR&#8208;I/II&#160;Cl&#8208;containing cyanine dyes. This strategy produces protein&#8208;escaping dyes, ensuring high fluorescence enhancement in the blood with rapid clearance and no residual fluorescence, allowing for short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging. This strategy in the perioperative monitoring of pedicle perforator flap models in mice and rats is successfully applied. Furthermore, leveraging the universality of this strategy, multiple nonoverlapping protein&#8208;escaping probes that achieve dual&#8208;excitation (808 and 1064&#160;nm) interference&#8208;free imaging of nerve&#8208;vessel and tumor&#8208;vessel simultaneously are designed and synthesized. These protein&#8208;escaping dyes enable long&#8208;term repeatable dual&#8208;color imaging of tumor localization, resection, and tumor&#8208;vessel reconstruction at the wound site.

         <title>Broken Inversion Symmetry in Van Der Waals Topological Ferromagnetic Metal Iron Germanium Telluride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Definitive evidence for inversion symmetry breaking in iron germanium telluride (FGT) is reported using second harmonic generation (SHG). Fe&#160;deficiency and temperature&#160;dependent SHG evolution conclude that Fe vacancies break the inversion symmetry and reduce the centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1. These findings add crucial new information to understanding FGT: band topology, intrinsic spin&#160;orbit torque, skyrmion, and topological polar metal states.








Abstract
Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin&#8208;orbit torque, which is crucial for next&#8208;generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit torque is established in the topological van der Waals&#160;(vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique is reported. The data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the threefold SHG pattern with dominant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp threefold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to the understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit torque, and topological vdW polar metal states.

         <title>Crystal Phase Engineering of Ultrathin Alloy Nanostructures for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of RuMo alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)/fcc heterophase is well achieved. Notably, fcc RuMo NFs demonstrate superior catalytic performance toward nitrate electroreduction to ammonia than hcp/fcc RuMo NFs. Mechanism studies reveal that crystal phase engineering of RuMo alloy nanostructures can significantly improve the electroactivity.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) toward ammonia synthesis is recognized as a sustainable strategy to balance the global nitrogen cycle. However, it still remains a great challenge to achieve highly efficient ammonia production due to the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process in NO3RR. Here, the controlled synthesis of RuMo alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase and hexagonal close&#8208;packed/fcc heterophase for highly efficient NO3RR is reported. Significantly, fcc RuMo NFs demonstrate high Faradaic efficiency of 95.2% and a large yield rate of 32.7&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 toward ammonia production at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations have unraveled that fcc RuMo NFs possess the highest d&#8208;band center with superior electroactivity, which originates from the strong Ru&#9472;Mo interactions and the high intrinsic activity of the unconventional fcc phase. The optimal electronic structures of fcc RuMo NFs supply strong adsorption of key intermediates with suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution, which further determines the remarkable NO3RR performance. The successful demonstration of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries with fcc RuMo NFs suggests their substantial application potential in electrochemical energy supply systems.

Thin&#8208;Film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2309183, Ji&#8208;Won Jung, Sang&#8208;Jin Lee, Hyun&#8208;Suk Kim, and co&#8208;workers focus on developing miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs), specifically addressing the challenge of low energy density in these batteries. The study introduces an innovative design for SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes, closely resembling traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) slurry formulations, which include an active material, a conductive agent, and a binder. A key innovation of this research is the use of mid&#8208;frequency (MF) sputtering to create a singular hybrid thin&#8208;film composed of SiOx nanoparticles, several conductive agents, and a strong binder made of plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC). Our design, which is analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes, proposes a new approach to TF&#8208;LIB fabrication.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202309183"&gt;2309183&lt;/a&gt;, Ji-Won Jung, Sang-Jin Lee, Hyun-Suk Kim, and co-workers focus on developing miniaturized thin-film lithium-ion batteries (TF-LIBs), specifically addressing the challenge of low energy density in these batteries. The study introduces an innovative design for SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-based thin-film electrodes, closely resembling traditional lithium-ion battery (LIB) slurry formulations, which include an active material, a conductive agent, and a binder. A key innovation of this research is the use of mid-frequency (MF) sputtering to create a singular hybrid thin-film composed of SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles, several conductive agents, and a strong binder made of plasma-polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC). Our design, which is analogous to SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-based thin-film electrodes, proposes a new approach to TF-LIB fabrication.

Optical Encryption
Both wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration and light intensity&#8208;tunable photoluminescence are independent and reliably manipulated in a rewritable dual&#8208;responsive encryption display based on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly. The display has the benefit of being a direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information by the human eye, enabling high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. More details can be found in article number 2310130 by Cheolmin Park and co&#8208;workers.

Lithium Metal Batteries
Lithium metal anodes exhibit over 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density based on conversion chemistry and are being prioritized as the next generation of energy storage devices. In article number 2311687 by Shaohua Guo and co&#8208;workers, various organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are summarized, and insights into how to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) are provided. This review offers a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived SEI and will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the exploitation of LMBs.

SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2
In article number 2311537 by Jincun Zhao, Xun Sun, and co&#8208;workers, a specific ACE2&#8208;binding peptide with a superior antiviral activity was identified and used to modified the inhaled nanoemulsions. The inhaled remdesivir nanoemulsions strongly inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 not only by blocking the binding of virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restricting virus replication intracellularly.

Information&#8208;Processing Materials
Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output decoder. The biomolecular decoder is programmed to convert specific binary molecular inputs into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information&#8208;processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and sensor signal processing. More details can be found in article number 2308092 by Wilfried Weber and co&#8208;workers.

Electrically Confined Electroluminescence
In article number 2310498, Gwan&#8208;Hyoung Lee and co&#8208;workers demonstrate electrically confined electroluminescence of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs). By achieving balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, and confining neutral exciton within the 1D region, the WSe2 LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2% at room temperature, which will be a promising approach to enhancing the EQE and modulating exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.

Orbital Gauge Field
In article number 2310010, Xian&#8208;Min Jin and co&#8208;workers realize an orbital gauge field to transmit high&#8208;dimensional quantum states. The orbital gauge field is constructed by a rotational defect on an atom&#8208;like lattice and shows a generalized and appealing perspective to control the behaviors of particles. The Hall&#8208;like transport of high&#8208;dimensional quantum states with protected orbital angular momentum represents a step towards generalized and large&#8208;scale quantum engineering.

         <title>Features of Anisotropic Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the current methods are reviewed to introduce anisotropy to micron sized particles or capsules, including non&#8208;spherical shape, loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems for fabrication are under discussion.








Abstract
Natural materials are anisotropic. Delivery systems occurring in nature, such as viruses, blood cells, pollen, and many others, do have anisotropy, while delivery systems made artificially are mostly isotropic. There is apparent complexity in engineering anisotropic particles or capsules with micron and submicron sizes. Nevertheless, some promising examples of how to fabricate particles with anisotropic shapes or having anisotropic chemical and/or physical properties are developed. Anisotropy of particles, once they face biological systems, influences their behavior. Internalization by the cells, flow in the bloodstream, biodistribution over organs and tissues, directed release, and toxicity of particles regardless of the same chemistry are all reported to be factors of anisotropy of delivery systems. Here, the current methods are reviewed to introduce anisotropy to particles or capsules, including loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties primarily by anisotropic magnetic properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems and limitations for fabrication are under discussion.

         <title>Perspectives on the Novel Multifunctional Nerve Guidance Conduits: From Specific Regenerative Procedures to Motor Function Rebuilding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review highlights the contribution of multifunctional nerve guidance conduits (NGC) and influence of their microscale biomaterial architecture on the nerve repairment. Chemical molecule induction, heterogeneous topographical morphology, anisotropic assembly microstructure, electroactivity and magnetic&#8208;sensitivity are expected to be pioneering features in the effective NGCs. The biosafety assessment and clinical trials of multifunctional NGCs are urgently required before the commercial application.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury potentially destroys the quality of life by inducing functional movement disorders and sensory capacity loss, which results in severe disability and substantial psychological, social, and financial burdens. Autologous nerve grafting has been commonly used as treatment in the clinic; however, its rare donor availability limits its application. A series of artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with advanced architectures are also proposed to promote injured peripheral nerve regeneration, which is a complicated process from axon sprouting to targeted muscle reinnervation. Therefore, exploring the interactions between sophisticated NGC complexes and versatile cells during each process including axon sprouting, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, nerve myelination, and muscle reinnervation is necessary. This review highlights the contribution of functional NGCs and the influence of microscale biomaterial architecture on biological processes of nerve repair. Progressive NGCs with chemical molecule induction, heterogenous topographical morphology, electroactive, anisotropic assembly microstructure, and self&#8208;powered electroactive and magnetic&#8208;sensitive NGCs are also collected, and they are expected to be pioneering features in future multifunctional and effective NGCs.

         <title>Ferroics in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites: Fundamentals, Design Strategies, and Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites are emerging as novel material paradigms with intrinsic ferroic behaviors. This review summarizes the fundamentals and design strategies of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and ferromagnetism in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites, and also discusses the underlying mechanisms of their multiferroic and magnetoelectric properties. The potential implementation in multilevel ferroic modulation, chirality as well as spin orbitronics is also presented.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) afford highly versatile structure design and lattice dimensionalities; thus, they are actively researched as material platforms for the tailoring of ferroic behaviors. Unlike single&#8208;phase organic or inorganic materials, the interlayer coupling between organic and inorganic components in HOIPs allows the modification of strain and symmetry by chirality transfer or lattice distortion, thereby enabling the coexistence of ferroic orders. This review focuses on the principles for engineering one or multiple ferroic orders in HOIPs, and the conditions for achieving multiferroicity and magnetoelectric properties. The prospects of multilevel ferroic modulation,&#160;chiral spin textures,&#160;and spin orbitronics in HOIPs are also presented.

         <title>Exploiting the Mechanical Bond Effect for Enhanced Molecular Recognition and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building upon the established chelate and macrocyclic effects, supramolecular chemists have exploited the mechanical bond to create selective supramolecular hosts with enhanced binding affinities and selectivity over non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocyclic host analogs. This review delineates advantages of mechanically interlocked hosts for charged species, and discusses current and potential applications of the mechanical bond effect for recognition and sensing applications.








Abstract
The ubiquity of charged species in biological and industrial processes has resulted in ever&#8208;increasing interest in their selective recognition, detection, and environmental remediation. Building on the established coordination chemistry principles of the chelate and macrocyclic effects, and host preorganization, supramolecular chemists seek to construct specific 3D binding cavities reminiscent of biotic systems to enhance host&#8208;guest binding affinity and selectivity. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) present a wholly unique platform for synthetic host design, wherein topologies afforded by the mechanical bond enable the decoration of 3D cavities for non&#8208;covalent interactions with a range of target guest geometries. Notably, MIM host systems exhibit mechanical bond effect augmented affinities and selectivities for a variety of charged guest species, compared to non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocycle host analogs. Furthermore, the modular nature of MIM synthesis facilitates incorporation of optical and electrochemical reporter groups, enabling fabrication of highly sensitive and specific molecular sensors. This review discusses the development of recognition and sensing MIMs, from the first reports in the late 20th century through to the present day, delineating how their topologically preorganized and dynamic host cavities enhance charged guest recognition and sensing, demonstrating the mechanical bond effect as a potent tool in future chemosensing materials.

Building on the established coordination chemistry principles of the chelate and macrocyclic effects, and host preorganization, supramolecular chemists seek to construct specific 3D binding cavities reminiscent of biotic systems to enhance host-guest binding affinity and selectivity. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) present a wholly unique platform for synthetic host design, wherein topologies afforded by the mechanical bond enable the decoration of 3D cavities for non-covalent interactions with a range of target guest geometries. Notably, MIM host systems exhibit mechanical bond effect augmented affinities and selectivities for a variety of charged guest species, compared to non-interlocked acyclic and macrocycle host analogs. Furthermore, the modular nature of MIM synthesis facilitates incorporation of optical and electrochemical reporter groups, enabling fabrication of highly sensitive and specific molecular sensors. This review discusses the development of recognition and sensing MIMs, from the first reports in the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century through to the present day, delineating how their topologically preorganized and dynamic host cavities enhance charged guest recognition and sensing, demonstrating the mechanical bond effect as a potent tool in future chemosensing materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Memristor&#8208;Based Neuromorphic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Additionally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.








Abstract
In the era of information, characterized by an exponential growth in data volume and an escalating level of data abstraction, there has been a substantial focus on brain&#8208;like chips, which are known for their robust processing power and energy&#8208;efficient operation. Memristors are widely acknowledged as the optimal electronic devices for the realization of neuromorphic computing, due to their innate ability to emulate the interconnection and information transfer processes witnessed among neurons. This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Subsequently, a thorough discussion of the memristor array, which serves as the pivotal component of the neuromorphic chip, as well as an examination of the present mainstream neural networks, is delved. Furthermore, the design of the neuromorphic chip is categorized into three crucial sections, including synapse&#8208;neuron cores, networks on chip (NoC), and neural network design. Finally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.

         <title>From Liquid to Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxides as Emerging Cathodes with High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospects for commercialization of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs with high energy density are highly encouraging, which will develop new opportunities to overcome the energy density and safety limitations of conventional liquid batteries. Ongoing research and interdisciplinary efforts are expected to overcome omni&#8208;direction challenges and propel LRMO cathodes toward practical applications in ASSBs significantly.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRMO) cathode materials have attracted widespread attention due to their high specific capacity, energy density, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges such as poor cycling stability, voltage deca,y and oxygen escape limit their commercial application in liquid Li&#8208;ion batteries. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of safe and resilient all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), driven by their remarkable safety features and superior energy density. ASSBs based on LRMO cathodes offer distinct advantages over conventional liquid Li&#8208;ion batteries, including long&#8208;term cycle stability, thermal and wider electrochemical windows stability, as well as the prevention of transition metal dissolution. This review aims to recapitulate the challenges and fundamental understanding associated with the application of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs. Additionally, it proposes the mechanisms of interfacial mechanical and chemical instability, introduces noteworthy strategies to enhance oxygen redox reversibility, enhances high&#8208;voltage interfacial stability, and optimizes Li+ transfer kinetics. Furthermore, it suggests potential research approaches to facilitate the large&#8208;scale implementation of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs.

         <title>Undercoordination Chemistry of Sulfur Electrocatalyst in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research advances of undercoordination chemistry in sulfur electrocatalysis including operation strategy and underlying working mechanisms are systematically combed in this review. Underlying working mechanisms are detailedly summarized in terms of polysulfide adsorption behaviors, polysulfide conversion kinetics, electron/ion transport, and dynamic reconstruction. Moreover, perspectives regarding the future of undercoordination chemistry are proposed.








Abstract
Undercoordination chemistry is an effective strategy to modulate the geometry&#8208;governed electronic structure and thereby regulate the activity of sulfur electrocatalysts. Efficient sulfur electrocatalysis is requisite to overcome the sluggish kinetics in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries aroused by multi&#8208;electron transfer and multi&#8208;phase conversions. Recent advances unveil the great promise of undercoordination chemistry in facilitating and stabilizing sulfur electrochemistry, yet a related review with systematicness and perspectives is still missing. Herein, it is carefully combed through the recent progress of undercoordination chemistry in sulfur electrocatalysis. The typical material structures and operational strategies are elaborated, while the underlying working mechanism is also detailly introduced and generalized into polysulfide adsorption behaviors, polysulfide conversion kinetics, electron/ion transport, and dynamic reconstruction. Moreover, perspectives on the future development of undercoordination chemistry are further proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Reactions on Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances in copper&#8208;based catalysts for sustainable production of valuable fuels and chemicals via electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions are summarized. The rational design of metallic copper, compounds, alloys, composites, and single&#8208;atom catalysts results in efficient electroreduction of substrates to valorized alkenes, alcohols, ammonia, amines, urea, and so on. The current issues and future opportunities in this area are provided.








Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions play a critical role in the synthesis of value&#8208;added products within the chemical industry. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) using water as the hydrogen source has emerged as an alternative to conventional thermocatalytic processes for sustainable and decentralized chemical synthesis under mild conditions. Among the various ECH catalysts, copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) nanomaterials are promising candidates due to their earth&#8208;abundance, unique electronic structure, versatility, and high activity/selectivity. Herein, recent advances in the application of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH reactions for the upgrading of valuable chemicals are systematically analyzed. The unique properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH are initially introduced, followed by design strategies to enhance their activity and selectivity. Then, typical ECH reactions on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are presented in detail, including carbon dioxide reduction for multicarbon generation, alkyne&#8208;to&#8208;alkene conversion, selective aldehyde conversion, ammonia production from nitrogen&#8208;containing substances, and amine production from organic nitrogen compounds. In these catalysts, the role of catalyst composition and nanostructures toward different products is focused. The co&#8208;hydrogenation of two substrates (e.g., CO2 and NOxn, SO32&#8211;, etc.) via C&#9472;N, C&#9472;S, and C&#9472;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions are also highlighted. Finally, the critical issues and future perspectives of Cu&#8208;catalyzed ECH are proposed to accelerate the rational development of next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <title>Personalized Cancer Nanomedicine: Overcoming Biological Barriers for Intracellular Delivery of Biopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discovers how RNA and 
mAbs&#160;are shaping the future of personalized cancer nanomedicine. This also dives into the current landscape and nanotechnology's battle with protein corona phenomena, explores strategies for enhanced tumor access and penetration, and confronts the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must conquer to reach intracellular domains. Perspectives on the remaining challenges and potential prospects are discussed.








Abstract
The success of personalized medicine in oncology relies on using highly effective and precise therapeutic modalities such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Unfortunately, the clinical exploitation of these biological drugs has encountered obstacles in overcoming intricate biological barriers. Drug delivery technologies represent a plausible strategy to overcome such barriers, ultimately facilitating the access to intracellular domains. Here, an overview of the current landscape on how nanotechnology has dealt with protein corona phenomena as a first and determinant biological barrier is presented.

&lt;p&gt;This review discovers how RNA and 
mAbs&#160;are shaping the future of personalized cancer nanomedicine. This also dives into the current landscape and nanotechnology's battle with protein corona phenomena, explores strategies for enhanced tumor access and penetration, and confronts the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must conquer to reach intracellular domains. Perspectives on the remaining challenges and potential prospects are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of personalized medicine in oncology relies on using highly effective and precise therapeutic modalities such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Unfortunately, the clinical exploitation of these biological drugs has encountered obstacles in overcoming intricate biological barriers. Drug delivery technologies represent a plausible strategy to overcome such barriers, ultimately facilitating the access to intracellular domains. Here, an overview of the current landscape on how nanotechnology has dealt with protein corona phenomena as a first and determinant biological barrier is presented. This continues with the analysis of strategies facilitating access to the tumor, along with conceivable methods for enhanced tumor penetration. As a final step, the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must confront in order for their biological cargo to reach their target are deeply analyzed. This review concludes with a critical analysis and future perspectives of the translational advances in personalized oncological nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering toward Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and proposes a variety of design principles. Various organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively and systematically summarized to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs for lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density are becoming increasingly important in global sustainability initiatives. However, uncontrollable dendrite seeds, inscrutable interfacial chemistry, and repetitively formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have severely hindered the advancement of LMBs. Organic molecules have been ingeniously engineered to construct targeted SEI and effectively minimize the above issues. In this review, multiple organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively summarized and insights into how to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs are provided. A variety of meticulously selected cases are analyzed in depth to support the arguments of molecular design in SEI. Specifically, the evolution of organic molecules&#8208;derived SEI is discussed and corresponding design principles are proposed, which are beneficial in guiding researchers to understand and architect SEI based on organic molecules. This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived SEI and will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the exploitation of LMBs.

         <title>Bypassing the Single Junction Limit with Advanced Photovoltaic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bayesian optimization&#8208;based simulation framework is presented, able to perform virtual optimization of multi&#8208;junction solar cell architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Vertical and lateral architectures are proposed to surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion.








Abstract
Multijunction devices and photon up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion are prominent concepts aimed at increasing photovoltaic efficiencies beyond the single junction limit. Integrating these concepts into advanced architectures may address long&#8208;standing issues such as processing complexity, microstructure control, and resilience against spectral changes of the incoming radiation. However, so far, no models have been established to predict the performance of such integrated architectures. Here, a simulation environment based on Bayesian optimization is presented, that can predict and virtually optimize the electrical performance of multi&#8208;junction architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Two architectures that would surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion at reasonable complexity are identified: a vertical &#8220;staggered half octave system,&#8221; where selective absorption allows the use of 6 different bandgaps, and the lateral &#8220;overlapping rainbow system&#8221; where selective irradiation allows the use of a narrowband energy acceptor with reduced voltage losses, according to the energy gap law. Both architectures would be highly resilient against spectral changes, in contrast with two terminal multi&#8208;junction architectures which are limited by Kirchhoff's law.
