      <title>Blood&#8208;Derived Biomaterial for Catheter&#8208;Directed Arterial Embolization</title>
      <dc:description>
Blood&#8208;derived biomaterial is engineered for catheter&#8208;directed arterial embolization. This embolic biomaterial shows remarkable modulus, radiopacity, retrievability, and bioactivity, capable of achieving durable embolization in porcine iliac and renal arteries. The blood&#8208;derived biomaterial is a simple and affordable embolic biomaterial that can be prepared at the point of care for emergency embolization procedures including the treatment of bleeding arteries.








Abstract
Vascular embolization is a life&#8208;saving minimally invasive catheter&#8208;based procedure performed to treat bleeding vessels. Through these catheters, numerous metallic coils are often pushed into the bleeding artery to stop the blood flow. While there are numerous drawbacks to coil embolization, physician expertise, availability of these coils, and their costs further limit their use. Here, a novel blood&#8208;derived embolic material (BEM) with regenerative properties, that can achieve instant and durable intra&#8208;arterial hemostasis regardless of coagulopathy, is developed. In a large animal model of vascular embolization, it is shown that the BEM can be prepared at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care within 26 min using fresh blood, it can be easily delivered using clinical catheters to embolize renal and iliac arteries, and it can achieve rapid hemostasis in acutely injured vessels. In swine arteries, the BEM increases cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue deposition, suggesting vessel healing and durable vessel occlusion. The BEM has significant advantages over embolic materials used today, making it a promising new tool for embolization.

      <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Healing Human&#8211;Machine Interactive Touch Pad with Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Adhesiveness on Targeted Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>
There is an increasing interest to develop next generation of touch pads requiring stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;healing to allow integration with human body. As stretchable and transparent ionic conductor, polyzwitterion&#8211;clay nanocomposite hydrogels are developed as human&#8211;machine interactive touch pads with pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesiveness on target substrates with high&#8208;resolution and self&#8208;healable input functions demonstrated by drawing, writing, and play electrical games.








Abstract
There is an increasing interest to develop a next generation of touch pads that require stretchability and biocompatibility to allow their integration with a human body, and even to mimic the self&#8208;healing behavior with fast functionality recovery upon damage. However, most touch pads are developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes with the lack of the important nature of self&#8208;healing. Polyzwitterion&#8211;clay nanocomposite hydrogels as a soft, stretchable, and transparent ionic conductor with transmittance of 98.8% and fracture strain beyond 1500% are developed, which can be used as a self&#8208;healing human&#8211;machine interactive touch pad with pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesiveness on target substrates. A surface&#8208;capacitive touch system is adopted to sense a touched position. Finger positions are perceived during both point&#8208;by&#8208;point touch and continuous moving. Hydrogel touch pads are adhered to curved or flat insulators, with the high&#8208;resolution and self&#8208;healable input functions demonstrated by drawing, writing, and playing electronic games.

&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing interest to develop next generation of touch pads requiring stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;healing to allow integration with human body. As stretchable and transparent ionic conductor, polyzwitterion&#8211;clay nanocomposite hydrogels are developed as human&#8211;machine interactive touch pads with pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesiveness on target substrates with high&#8208;resolution and self&#8208;healable input functions demonstrated by drawing, writing, and play electrical games.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing interest to develop a next generation of touch pads that require stretchability and biocompatibility to allow their integration with a human body, and even to mimic the self&#8208;healing behavior with fast functionality recovery upon damage. However, most touch pads are developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes with the lack of the important nature of self&#8208;healing. Polyzwitterion&#8211;clay nanocomposite hydrogels as a soft, stretchable, and transparent ionic conductor with transmittance of 98.8% and fracture strain beyond 1500% are developed, which can be used as a self&#8208;healing human&#8211;machine interactive touch pad with pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesiveness on target substrates. A surface&#8208;capacitive touch system is adopted to sense a touched position. Finger positions are perceived during both point&#8208;by&#8208;point touch and continuous moving. Hydrogel touch pads are adhered to curved or flat insulators, with the high&#8208;resolution and self&#8208;healable input functions demonstrated by drawing, writing, and playing electronic games.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Surface Se&#8208;Substituted LiCo[O2&#8722;&#948;Se&#948;] Cathode with Ultrastable High&#8208;Voltage Cycling in Pouch Full&#8208;Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Selenium has an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect when charging commercial LiCoO2 to high voltages, by substituting part of the mobile oxidized oxygen ions (O&#945;&#8208;) in the charged lattice to eliminate oxygen vacancies, transplant the pumped charges from O&#945;&#8208;, and reduce the mobile O&#945;&#8208; ions back to immobile O2&#8208; ions, to stop further oxygen migration and stabilize the high&#8208;voltage cycling.








Abstract
Cycling LiCoO2 to above 4.5&#160;V for higher capacity is enticing; however, hybrid O anion&#8208; and Co cation&#8208;redox (HACR) at high voltages facilitates intrinsic O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&#160;&lt; 2) migration, causing oxygen loss, phase collapse, and electrolyte decomposition that severely degrade the battery cyclability. Hereby, commercial LiCoO2 particles are operando treated with selenium, a well&#8208;known anti&#8208;aging element to capture oxygen&#8208;radicals in the human body, showing an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect in high&#8208;voltage battery cycling and successfully stopping the escape of oxygen from LiCoO2 even when the cathode is cycled to 4.62 V. Ab initio calculation and soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis suggest that during deep charging, the precoated Se will initially substitute some mobile O&#945;&#8722; at the charged LiCoO2 surface, transplanting the pumped charges from O&#945;&#8722; and reducing it back to O2&#8722; to stabilize the oxygen lattice in prolonged cycling. As a result, the material retains 80% and 77% of its capacity after 450 and 550 cycles under 100 mA g&#8722;1 in 4.57&#160;V pouch full&#8208;cells matched with a graphite anode and an ultralean electrolyte (2&#160;g Ah&#8722;1).

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Like Ultrahigh Free&#8208;Carrier Concentration in Metal&#8208;Oxide Material for Giant and Tunable Plasmon Resonance</title>
      <dc:description>
The giant and tunable plasmonic material of HxMoO3 holds a high free&#8208;carrier concentration up to 1021 cm&#8722;3, approaching that of metals. The unique quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure provides a long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra with an enhancement factor of 1.1 &#215; 107 and a detection limit of 1 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mol L&#8722;1 are achieved, representing the best among the hitherto reported metal oxides.








Abstract
The practical utilization of plasmon&#8208;based technology relies on the ability to find high&#8208;performance plasmonic materials other than noble metals. A key scientific challenge is to significantly increase the intrinsically low concentration of free carriers in metal&#8208;oxide materials. Here, a novel electron&#8211;proton co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to achieve uniform hydrogen doping in metal&#8208;oxide MoO3 at mild conditions, which creates a metal&#8208;like ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration approaching that of noble metals (1021 cm&#8722;3 in H1.68MoO3 versus 1022 cm&#8722;3 in Au/Ag). This bestows giant and tunable plasmonic resonances in the visible region to this originally semiconductive material. Using ultrafast spectroscopy characterizations and first&#8208;principle simulations, the formation of a quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure that leads to long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field is revealed. As verified by the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of rhodamine 6G molecules on HxMoO3, the SERS enhancement factor reaches as high as 1.1 &#215; 107 with a detection limit at concentration as low as 1 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mol L&#8722;1, representing the best among the hitherto reported non&#8208;metal systems. The findings not only provide a set of metal&#8208;like semiconductor materials with merits of low cost, tunable electronic structure, and plasmonic resonance, but also a general strategy to induce tunable ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration in non&#8208;metal systems.

      <title>Biomimicking Antibacterial Opto&#8208;Electro Sensing Sutures Made of Regenerated Silk Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
A set of biomimicking, antibacterial, and sensing sutures made of regenerated silk fibroin inspired by natural spider&#8208;silk fibers is presented. These sensing sutures are hierarchically structured and heterogeneously functionalized so as to integrate multiple, clinically favorable functions into one suture device. These functions include reducing inflammation, antibacterial activity, tension measurements, aiding tissue healing, and opto&#8208;electro monitoring.








Abstract
Surgical sutures play an important role across a wide range of medical treatments and a wide variety exist, differing in strength, size, composition, and performance. Recently, increasing interest has been paid to bioactive and electronic sutures made of synthetic polymers, owing to their ability to reduce inflammation as well as medically and/or electronically facilitate wound healing. However, integrating sensing capabilities into bioactive sutures without adversely affecting their mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and/or bioactivity remains challenging. In this work, a set of biomimicking, antibacterial, and sensing sutures based on the regenerated silk fibroin is designed and fabricated. These sensing sutures, inspired by the &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; multilayered structure of natural spider&#8208;silk fibers, are hierarchically structured and heterogeneously functionalized to allow for the integration of multiple, clinically favorable functions into one suture device. These functions included: reducing inflammation and bacterial infection in wound sites, measuring tension of both the tissue and suture, and aiding tissue healing via multi&#8208;modal controlled drug and growth factor release. Critically, these functions are coupled with real&#8208;time optical and electronic monitoring capabilities. This approach provides greater insight into multifunctional sutures with inherent sensing capabilities and offers enormous potential in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

The discovery of efficient n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials is key to state&#8208;of&#8208;the art thermoelectric materials and can enable the design of efficient and fully organic thermoelectric generators. In article number 2002752, Dehua Hu, Xavier Crispin, Yuguang Ma, and co&#8208;workers develop a novel n&#8208;type perylene bisimide mixed&#8208;ion&#8211;electron conductor with record&#8208;high thermoelectric properties induced by the Soret effect.

      <title>Memory Devices: Filament&#8208;Free Bulk Resistive Memory Enables Deterministic Analogue Switching (Adv. Mater. 45/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2003984, Yiyang Li, A. Alec Talin, and co&#8208;workers design a deterministic nonvolatile resistive memory cell without nanosized filaments. By using the statistical ensemble behavior of all point defects within the 3D bulk for information storage, they solve the challenge of stochastic switching that has plagued filament&#8208;based memristors. This provides a compelling artificial synapse for energy&#8208;efficient, neuromorphic computing.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Metaholographic Displays with Designer Liquid Crystal Modulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based metamaterial devices, which can sense targeted stimuli such as electric&#8208;field, temperature and pressure, and report them optically by displaying corresponding holograms, are demonstrated. The demonstrated systems enable a variety of applications like hologram labels that indicate freshness of temperature&#8208;sensitive products during storage or transport and interactive holographic displays with touch sensing or motion recognition.








Abstract
Flat optics, realized by the artificially created 2D material platform called optical metasurfaces, is currently undergoing a science&#8208;to&#8208;technology transition. However, &#8220;real&#8208;time&#8221; active operations of such flat optical devices remain yet unresolved. Here, liquid crystals (LCs)&#8208;integrated metaholograms for ultracompact dynamic holographic displays are proposed. The anisotropic nature of the LCs allows facile and repeatable manipulation of the polarization of light. Specifically designed (&#8220;designer&#8221;) LCs and efficient helicity&#8208;encoded metaholograms are combined to realize stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic displays. The designer LC modulators are used as switches that enable a variety of external stimuli (e.g., electric field, heat, surface pressure) to operate holographic images in real&#8208;time. Such a dynamic metaholographic platform will provide a path to external stimuli&#8208;driven &#8220;smart&#8221; sensing and display applications such as hologram labels for temperature/pressure/touch monitoring and interactive holographic displays with haptic motion recognition.

      <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Photoengraving of Monolithic, Multifaceted Metasurfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
A 3D photoengraving strategy capable of integrating diverse metasurfaces into a single composite monolith is demonstrated.&#160;This&#160;method facilitates micro&#8208;/nanoscale patterning of metasurfaces onto individual facets in a diverse range of 3D scaffolds, in an independent, high&#8208;throughput, and on&#8208;demand fashion.








Abstract
Metasurfaces present a potent platform to manipulate light by the spatial arrangement of sub&#8208;wavelength patterns with well&#8208;defined sizes and geometries, in thin films. Metasurfaces by definition are planar. However, it would be highly desirable to integrate metasurfaces with diverse, spatially programmed sub&#8208;wavelength features into a 3D monolith, to manipulate light within a compact 3D space. Here, a 3D photoengraving strategy is presented; that is, generation of such composite metasurfaces from a single microstructure via the irradiation of multiple interference laser beams onto different facets of the parent azopolymeric microstructure. Through &#8220;photofluidization,&#8221;&#160;this&#160;technique enables independent inscription and erasing of metasurfaces onto and from individual facets of 3D monoliths with arbitrary shapes and dimensions, in a high&#8208;throughput fashion (over approximately a few cm2 at a time). By engraving discrete sub&#8208;wavelength 1D surface relief gratings of different pitches on different facets of an inverse pyramidal array, a multiplexing structure&#8208;color filter is demonstrated.

However, it would be highly desirable to integrate metasurfaces with diverse, spatially programmed sub&#8208;wavelength features into a 3D monolith, to manipulate light within a compact 3D space. Here, a 3D photoengraving strategy is presented; that is, generation of such composite metasurfaces from a single microstructure via the irradiation of multiple interference laser beams onto different facets of the parent azopolymeric microstructure. Through &#8220;photofluidization,&#8221;&#160;this&#160;technique enables independent inscription and erasing of metasurfaces onto and from individual facets of 3D monoliths with arbitrary shapes and dimensions, in a high&#8208;throughput fashion (over approximately a few cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a time). By engraving discrete sub&#8208;wavelength 1D surface relief gratings of different pitches on different facets of an inverse pyramidal array, a multiplexing structure&#8208;color filter is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kinetically Stable Oxide Overlayers on Mo3P Nanoparticles Enabling Lithium&#8211;Air Batteries with Low Overpotentials and Long Cycle Life</title>
      <dc:description>
Mo3P nanoparticles with a kinetically stable oxide overlayer exhibit remarkable ORR/OER activities near thermodynamic potentials in non&#8208;aqueous media. Using this catalyst alongside TEMPO and DBBQ redox mediators in a lithium&#8211;air battery favors the solution&#8208;based mechanism for epitaxial growth of Li2O2 at the lowest overpotentials, the effects of which are addressed through directed experimental efforts in electrochemical characterization coupled with a computational approach.








Abstract
The main drawbacks of today's state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;air) batteries are their low energy efficiency and limited cycle life due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant cathode catalysts that can drive both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) at high rates at thermodynamic potentials. Here, inexpensive trimolybdenum phosphide (Mo3P) nanoparticles with an exceptional activity&#8212;ORR and OER current densities of 7.21 and 6.85 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.0 and 4.2 V versus Li/Li+, respectively&#8212;in an oxygen&#8208;saturated non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte are reported. The Tafel plots indicate remarkably low charge transfer resistance&#8212;Tafel slopes of 35 and 38 mV dec&#8722;1 for ORR and OER, respectively&#8212;resulting in the lowest ORR overpotential of 4.0 mV and OER overpotential of 5.1 mV reported to date. Using this catalyst, a Li&#8211;air battery cell with low discharge and charge overpotentials of 80 and 270 mV, respectively, and high energy efficiency of 90.2% in the first cycle is demonstrated. A long cycle life of 1200 is also achieved for this cell. Density functional theory calculations of ORR and OER on Mo3P (110) reveal that an oxide overlayer formed on the surface gives rise to the observed high ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity and small discharge/charge overpotentials.

      <title>Observation of Supercavity Modes in Subwavelength Dielectric Resonators</title>
      <dc:description>
Excitation of supercavity modes in high&#8208;index subwavelength dielectric resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is demonstrated in near&#8208;field and far&#8208;field measurements. The measured unloaded Q factor of supercavity modes is in the range from 500 to 12&#160;500, limited by absorption losses. A peculiar change of the directivity pattern of supercavity modes and their relation to Fano resonances is shown experimentally.








Abstract
Electromagnetic response of dielectric resonators with high refractive index is governed by optically induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances facilitating confinement of light with the amplitude enhancement. Traditionally, strong subwavelength trapping of light was associated only with plasmonic or epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero structures, which however suffer from material losses. Recently, an alternative localization mechanism was proposed allowing the trapping of light in individual subwavelength optical resonators with a high quality factor in the regime of a supercavity mode. Here, the experimental observation of the supercavity modes in subwavelength ceramic resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is presented. It is experimentally demonstrated that the regime of supercavity modes can be achieved via precise tuning of the resonator's dimensions. A huge growth of the unloaded quality factor is achieved with experimental values up to 1.25&#160;&#215; 104, limited only by material losses of ceramics. It is revealed that the supercavity modes can be excited efficiently both in the near&#8208; and far&#8208;field. In both cases, the supercavity mode manifests itself explicitly as a Fano resonance with characteristic peculiarities of spectral shape and radiation pattern. A comparison of supercavities made of diversified materials for the visible, infrared, THz, and radio&#8208;frequency regimes is provided.

      <title>A Solvent&#8208;Exchange Strategy to Regulate Noncovalent Interactions for Strong and Antiswelling Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to construct a class of stiff and antiswelling hydrogels (named as exogels). Key to this approach is the rational regulation of noncovalent interactions and thus the conformation of polymers and structure of the cross&#8208;linked networks. Moreover, the unique sol&#8211;gel progression via solvent exchange makes exogels applicable for robust underwater adhesion.








Abstract
Physical hydrogels from existing polymers consisting of noncovalent interacting networks are highly desired due to their well&#8208;controlled compositions and environmental friendliness; and therefore, applied as adhesives, artificial tissues, and soft machines. Nevertheless, these gels have suffered from weak mechanical strength and low water resistance. Current methodologies used to fabricate these hydrogels mainly involve the freezing&#8211;thawing process (cryogels), which are complicated in preparation and short in adjustment of polymer conformation. Here, taking the merits of noncovalent bonds in adjustability and reversibility, a solvent&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to construct a class of exogels. Based on the exchange from a good solvent subsequently to a poor one, the intra&#8208; and interpolymer interactions are initially suppressed and then recovered, resulting in dissolving and cross&#8208;linking to polymers, respectively. Key to this approach is the good solvent, which favors of a stretched polymer conformation to homogenize the network, forming cross&#8208;linked hydrogel networks with remarkable stiffness, toughness, antiswelling properties, and thus underwater adhesive performance. The exogels highlight a facile but highly effective strategy of turning the solvent and consequently the noncovalent interactions to achieve the rational design of enhanced hydrogels and hydrogel&#8208;based soft materials.

      <dc:description>
Van der Waals epitaxial growth of wafer&#8208;scale mosaic&#8208;like 2D PtTe2 layer is achieved for highly sensitive MIR photodetection. A photodetector based on a PtTe2/Si Schottky junction is capable of sensing ultrabroadband light of up to 10.6 &#181;m with a high specific detectivity. The photodetector arrays also display an excellent room&#8208;temperature MIR imaging capability.








Abstract
Mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) photodetection, covering diverse molecular vibrational regions and atmospheric transmission windows, is vital to civil and military purposes. Versatile use of MIR photodetectors is commonly dominated by HgCdTe alloys, InSb, and quantum superlattices, which are limited by strict operation demands, high&#8208;cost, and environmental toxicity. Despite the rapid advances of black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based MIR photodetectors, these are subject to poor stability and large&#8208;area integration difficulty. Here, the van der Waals (vdW) epitaxial growth of a wafer&#8208;scale 2D platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) layer is reported via a simple tellurium&#8208;vapor transformation approach. The 2D PtTe2 layer possesses a unique mosaic&#8208;like crystal structure consisting of single&#8208;crystal domains with highly preferential [001] orientation along the normal direction, reducing the influence of interface defects and ensuring efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane carrier transportation. This characteristic, combined with the wide absorption of PtTe2 and well&#8208;designed vertical device architecture, makes the PtTe2/Si Schottky junction photodetector capable of sensing ultra&#8208;broadband light of up to 10.6 &#181;m with a high specific detectivity. Also, the photodetector exhibits an excellent room&#8208;temperature infrared&#8208;imaging capability. This approach provides a new design concept for high&#8208;performance, room&#8208;temperature MIR photodetection based on 2D layered materials.

      <title>Scalable Substitutional Re&#8208;Doping and its Impact on the Optical and Electronic Properties of Tungsten Diselenide</title>
      <dc:description>
Substitutional rhenium (Re) doping of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) films is achieved via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at front&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (FEOL) and back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (BEOL) compatible temperatures, with the doping concentration of &lt;0.001%. Trion concentration is increased as a function of dopant concentration and discrete donor levels are observed that lie close to the conduction band confirming the n&#8208;type dopant nature of the rhenium atoms.








Abstract
Reliable, controlled doping of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides will enable the realization of next&#8208;generation electronic, logic&#8208;memory, and magnetic devices based on these materials. However, to date, accurate control over dopant concentration and scalability of the process remains a challenge. Here, a systematic study of scalable in situ doping of fully coalesced 2D WSe2 films with Re atoms via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition is reported. Dopant concentrations are uniformly distributed over the substrate surface, with precisely controlled concentrations down to &lt;0.001%&#160;Re achieved by tuning the precursor partial pressure. Moreover, the impact of doping on morphological, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of WSe2 is elucidated with detailed experimental and theoretical examinations, confirming that the substitutional doping of Re at the W site leads to n&#8208;type behavior of WSe2. Transport characteristics of fabricated back&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors are directly correlated to the dopant concentration, with degrading device performances for doping concentrations exceeding 1% of Re. The study demonstrates a viable approach to introducing true dopant&#8208;level impurities with high precision, which can be scaled up to batch production for applications beyond digital electronics.

     alt="Scalable Substitutional Re&#8208;Doping and its Impact on the Optical and Electronic Properties of Tungsten Diselenide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitutional rhenium (Re) doping of tungsten diselenide (WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) films is achieved via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at front&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (FEOL) and back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (BEOL) compatible temperatures, with the doping concentration of &amp;lt;0.001%. Trion concentration is increased as a function of dopant concentration and discrete donor levels are observed that lie close to the conduction band confirming the n&#8208;type dopant nature of the rhenium atoms.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliable, controlled doping of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides will enable the realization of next&#8208;generation electronic, logic&#8208;memory, and magnetic devices based on these materials. However, to date, accurate control over dopant concentration and scalability of the process remains a challenge. Here, a systematic study of scalable in situ doping of fully coalesced 2D WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films with Re atoms via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition is reported. Dopant concentrations are uniformly distributed over the substrate surface, with precisely controlled concentrations down to &amp;lt;0.001%&#160;Re achieved by tuning the precursor partial pressure. Moreover, the impact of doping on morphological, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is elucidated with detailed experimental and theoretical examinations, confirming that the substitutional doping of Re at the W site leads to n&#8208;type behavior of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Transport characteristics of fabricated back&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors are directly correlated to the dopant concentration, with degrading device performances for doping concentrations exceeding 1% of Re. The study demonstrates a viable approach to introducing true dopant&#8208;level impurities with high precision, which can be scaled up to batch production for applications beyond digital electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polymeric Membranes with Selective Solution&#8208;Diffusion for Intercepting Volatile Organic Compounds during Solar&#8208;Driven Water Remediation</title>
      <dc:description>
A micropyramid&#8208;structured PPy membrane with selective solution&#8208;diffusion effect is employed as the photothermal material for solar water purification. The membrane is successful in intercepting the evaporation of volatile organic molecules in wastewater. Furthermore, its high light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency and good mechanical strength make the membrane a promising photothermal material for practical solar water purification.








Abstract
Solar evaporation through a photothermal porous material provides a feasible and sustainable method for water remediation. Several photothermal materials have been developed to enhance solar evaporation efficiency. However, a critical limitation of current photothermal materials is their inability to separate water from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in wastewater. Here, a microstructured ultrathin polymeric membrane that enables freshwater separation from VOC pollutants by solar evaporation with a VOC removal rate of 90%, is reported. The different solution&#8208;diffusion behaviors of water and VOCs with polymeric membranes facilitate their separation. Moreover, owing to increased light absorption, enlarged liquid&#8211;air interface, and shortened mass transfer distance, the microstructured and ultrathin configuration of the membrane helps to balance the tradeoff between permeation selectivity and water production capacity. The membrane is not only effective for evaporation of simulated volatile pollutants in a prototype, but can also intercept complex volatile organic contaminants in natural water sources and produce water that meets drinking&#8208;water standards. With practical demonstration and satisfactory purification performance, this work paves the way for practical application of solar evaporation for effective water remediation.

      <title>HASEL Artificial Muscles for a New Generation of Lifelike Robots&#8212;Recent Progress and Future Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators are a new, versatile class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles. Current research in materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and controls is discussed and the wide opportunities for future interdisciplinary research to realize HASEL artificial muscles with drastically improved performance for use as building blocks of bioinspired intelligent systems of the future are laid out.








Abstract
Future robots and intelligent systems will autonomously navigate in unstructured environments and closely collaborate with humans; integrated with our bodies and minds, they will allow us to surpass our physical limitations. Traditional robots are mostly built from rigid, metallic components and electromagnetic motors, which make them heavy, expensive, unsafe near people, and ill&#8208;suited for unpredictable environments. By contrast, biological organisms make extensive use of soft materials and radically outperform robots in terms of dexterity, agility, and adaptability. Particularly, natural muscle&#8212;a masterpiece of evolution&#8212;has long inspired researchers to create &#8220;artificial muscles&#8221; in an attempt to replicate its versatility, seamless integration with sensing, and ability to self&#8208;heal. To date, natural muscle remains unmatched in all&#8208;round performance, but rapid advancements in soft robotics have brought viable alternatives closer than ever. Herein, the recent development of hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a new class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles that couple electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve diverse modes of actuation, is discussed; current designs match or exceed natural muscle in many metrics. Research on materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and control systems for HASEL actuators is detailed. In each area, research opportunities are identified, which together lays out a roadmap for actuators with drastically improved performance. With their unique versatility and wide potential for further improvement, HASEL actuators are poised to play an important role in a paradigm shift that fundamentally challenges the current limitations of robotic hardware toward future intelligent systems that replicate the vast capabilities of biological organisms.

      <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of nucleic acid materials that can perform &#8220;switching&#8221; processes and achieve complex functions such as signaling or controlled payload release in response to external stimuli including light, pH, ligand&#8208;binding, and other microenvironmental cues is presented. The underlying mechanisms that enable such stimulus&#8208;driven responses, and strategies for engineering those functionalities into nanomaterials are described.








Abstract
Although RNA and DNA are best known for their capacity to encode biological information, it has become increasingly clear over the past few decades that these biomolecules are also capable of performing other complex functions, such as molecular recognition (e.g., aptamers) and catalysis (e.g., ribozymes). Building on these foundations, researchers have begun to exploit the predictable base&#8208;pairing properties of RNA and DNA in order to utilize nucleic acids as functional materials that can undergo a molecular &#8220;switching&#8221; process, performing complex functions such as signaling or controlled payload release in response to external stimuli including light, pH, ligand&#8208;binding and other microenvironmental cues. Although this field is still in its infancy, these efforts offer exciting potential for the development of biologically based &#8220;smart materials&#8221;. Herein, ongoing progress in the use of nucleic acids as an externally controllable switching material is reviewed. The diverse range of mechanisms that can trigger a stimulus response, and strategies for engineering those functionalities into nucleic acid materials are explored. Finally, recent progress is discussed in incorporating aptamer switches into more complex synthetic nucleic acid&#8208;based nanostructures and functionalized smart materials.

      <title>Preintercalation Strategy in Manganese Oxides for Electrochemical Energy Storage: Review and Prospects</title>
      <dc:description>
The intrinsic advantages and mechanisms of the preintercalation strategy in enhancing intrinsic conductivity, activating more active sites, promoting diffusion kinetics, and stabilizing structural integrity of MnO2 cathode materials are reviewed. Simultaneously, the current challenges for the preintercalation strategy for future research and development regarding the design of high&#8208;performance MnO2 cathodes for the next&#8208;generation batteries are discussed.








Abstract
Manganese oxides (MnO2) are promising cathode materials for various kinds of battery applications, including Li&#8208;ion, Na&#8208;ion, Mg&#8208;ion, and Zn&#8208;ion batteries, etc., due to their low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity. However, the practical application of MnO2 cathodes has been restricted by some critical issues including low electronic conductivity, low utilization of discharge depth, sluggish diffusion kinetics, and structural instability upon cycling. Preintercalation of ions/molecules into the crystal structure with/without structural reconstruction provides essential optimizations to alleviate these issues. Here, the intrinsic advantages and mechanisms of the preintercalation strategy in enhancing electronic conductivity, activating more active sites, promoting diffusion kinetics, and stabilizing the structural integrity of MnO2 cathode materials are summarized. The current challenges related to the preintercalation strategy, along with prospects for the future research and development regarding its implementation in the design of high&#8208;performance MnO2 cathodes for the next&#8208;generation batteries are also discussed.

      <title>Biomimetic Diselenide&#8208;Bridged Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles as an X&#8208;ray&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Carrier for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomimetic mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles are tailored for radiation&#8208;responsive delivery of doxorubicin to solid tumors and are combined with a PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade as a chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiation, these cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanotherapeutics exhibit degradation&#8208;controlled drug release and induce anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, leading to enhanced tumor regression and metastasis inhibition with low systemic toxicity when combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Chemotherapy causes off&#8208;target toxicity and is often ineffective against solid tumors. Targeted and on&#8208;demand release of chemotherapeutics remains a challenge. Here, cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) containing X&#8208;ray&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive diselenide bonds for controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX) at tumor sites are developed. DOX&#8208;loaded MONs coated with 4T1 breast cancer cell membranes (CM@MON@DOX) show greater accumulation at tumor sites and prolonged blood circulation time versus an uncoated control in mice bearing 4T1 orthotopic mammary tumors. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiation, the DOX&#8208;loaded MONs exhibit carrier degradation&#8208;controlled release via cleavage of diselenide bonds, resulting in DOX&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death at the tumor site. Combination with a PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade further enhances inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis with low systemic toxicity. Together, the findings show the promise of these biomimetic, radiation&#8208;responsive diselenide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs in chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

      <title>Enhancing the Performance of Organic Solar Cells by Prolonging the Lifetime of Photogenerated Excitons</title>
      <dc:description>
9&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (FCA) is utilized to prolong the lifetime of photogenerated excitons in a nonfullerene acceptor (IT&#8208;M) approximately twofold, ensuring longer exciton diffusion length and efficiency enhancement in organic photovoltaic devices. The prolongation arises from the first&#8208;discovered intermolecular vibrational coupling between the electronic excited state of IT&#8208;M and the electronic ground state of FCA, thus suppressing the nonradiative decay.








Abstract
Exciton lifetime (&#964;) is crucial for the migration of excitons to donor/acceptor interfaces for subsequent charge separation in organic solar cells (OSCs); however, obvious prolongation of &#964; has rarely been achieved. Here, by introducing a solid additive 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (FCA) into the active layer, which comprises a nonfullerene acceptor, 3,9&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylene&#8208;((3&#8208;(1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene)&#8208;6/7&#8208;methyl)&#8208;indanone))&#8208;5,5,11,11&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;hexylphenyl)&#8208;dithieno[2,3&#8208;d:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d&#8242;]&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (IT&#8208;M), &#964; is substantially prolonged from 491 to 928 ps, together with obvious increases in fluorescence intensity and quantum yield. Time&#8208;resolved transient infrared spectra indicate the presence of an intermolecular vibrational coupling between the electronic excited state of IT&#8208;M and the electronic ground state of FCA, which is first observed here and which can suppress the internal conversion process. IT&#8208;M&#8208;based OSCs display an improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor after the addition of FCA. Thus, the power conversion efficiency is increased, particularly for devices with a large donor/acceptor ratio of 1:4, whose efficiency is increased by 56%. This study describes a novel method, which is also applicable to other nonfullerene acceptors, for further improving the performance of OSCs without affecting their morphology and light absorption properties.

      <title>Spontaneously Splitting Copper Nanowires into Quantum Dots on Graphdiyne for Suppressing Lithium Dendrites</title>
      <dc:description>
The crystal structure of copper (Cu) impacts the growth of graphdiyne. As&#8208;grown graphdiyne splits Cu into quantum dots. Cu quantum dots on graphdiyne have high lithiophilicity to suppress lithium dendrites. This one&#8208;step method to produce Cu quantum dots on all&#8208;carbon graphdiyne can be used to develop many new&#8208;concept and high&#8208;activity catalysts for sustainable technologies.








Abstract
As an emerging carbon allotrope, the controllable growth of graphdiyne has been an important means to explore its unique scientific properties and applications. In this work, the effect of the crystal structure of copper (Cu) on the growth of graphdiyne is systematically studied. It is found that the crystal boundaries are the origin of the reaction activity. The polycrystalline Cu nanowire with many crystal boundaries is spontaneously split into Cu quantum dots (about 3&#160;nm) by the grown graphdiyne. These Cu quantum dots are uniformly dispersed on the graphdiyne, and they block the long&#8208;range ordered growth of the graphdiyne. These Cu quantum dots in situ supported on graphdiyne demonstrate high efficiency in inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites in lithium metal batteries. Based on this interesting finding, the Cu quantum dots anchored on the all&#8208;carbon graphdiyne can be prepared on a large scale, and unique applications of Cu quantum dots in electrochemical fields can be implemented.

      <title>Reversibly Transforming a Highly Swollen Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel to an Extremely Tough One and its Application as a Tubular Grasper</title>
      <dc:description>
Reversible transformation of polyelectrolyte hydrogels between swollen, weak and collapsed, tough states is realized by formation and breaking up of robust metal&#8208;coordination complexes. The dramatic variations of the gels&#8217; volume and mechanical properties over 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude enable the design of a hydrogel&#8208;based tubular grasper with high holding force, i.e., thousand times its own weight, to grip objects with different geometries.








Abstract
Poly(2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid) and its copolymer hydrogels are typical polyelectrolyte gels with extremely high swelling capacity that are widely used in industry. It's common to consider these hydrogels as weak materials that are difficult to toughen. Reported here is a facile strategy to transform swollen and weak poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid) [P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS)] hydrogels to tough ones by forming strong sulfonate&#8211;Zr4+ metal&#8208;coordination complexes. The resultant hydrogels with moderate water content possess high stiffness, strength, and fracture energy, which can be tuned over 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude by controlling the composition and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio. Owing to the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, these hydrogels show rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent mechanical performances, as well as good self&#8208;recovery properties. This strategy is universal, as manifested by the drastically improved mechanical properties of hydrogels of various natural and synthetic sulfonate&#8208;containing polymers. The toughened hydrogels can be converted to the original swollen ones by breaking up the metal&#8208;coordination complexes in alkaline solutions. The reversible brittle&#8211;tough transition and concomitant dramatic volume change of polyelectrolyte hydrogels afford diverse applications, as demonstrated by the design of a tubular grasper with holding force a thousand times its own weight for objects with different geometries. It is envisioned that these hydrogels enable versatile applications in the biomedical and engineering fields.

      <title>Synergistic Optimization Enables Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells to Maintain over 98% PCE of the Small&#8208;Area Rigid Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
With&#160;synergistic&#160;optimization of the active layer morphology, flexible substrate properties, and processing temperature, large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells with high performance are achieved by the slot&#8208;die coating process. The 1 cm2 flexible devices produce an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.16%, and, for modules with an area of 25 cm2, an extraordinary PCE of 10.09% is observed.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is generally regarded as the most effective large&#8208;scale methodology for the fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the corresponding device performance significantly lags behind spin&#8208;coated devices. Herein, the active layer morphology, flexible substrate properties, and the processing temperature are optimized synergistically to obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for both the flexible single cells and the modules. As a result, the 1 cm2 flexible devices produce an excellent PCE of 12.16% as compared to 12.37% for the spin&#8208;coated small&#8208;area (0.04 cm2) rigid devices. Likewise, for modules with an area of 25 cm2, an extraordinary PCE of 10.09% is observed. Hence, efficiency losses associated with the upscaling are significantly reduced by the synergistic optimization. Moreover, after 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 10&#160;mm, the flexible devices still produce over 99% of their initial PCE, whereas after being stored for over 6000 h in a glove box, the PCE reaches 103% of its initial value, indicating excellent device flexibility as well as superior shelf stability. These results, thus, are a promising confirmation the great potential for upscaling of large&#8208;area OSCs in the near future.

      <title>The Role of Demixing and Crystallization Kinetics on the Stability of Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Through investigation of the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor crystallization, the importance of diffusion coefficients and melting enthalpies in controlling the crystal growth rates, and that differences in halogenation can drastically change crystallization kinetics and device stability are revealed.








Abstract
With power conversion efficiency now over 17%, a long operational lifetime is essential for the successful application of organic solar cells. However, most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can crystallize and destroy devices, yet the fundamental underlying thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of acceptor crystallization have received limited attention. Here, room&#8208;temperature (RT) diffusion coefficients of 3.4 &#215; 10&#8722;23 and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;22 are measured for ITIC&#8208;2Cl and ITIC&#8208;2F, two state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. The low coefficients are enough to provide for kinetic stabilization of the morphology against demixing at RT. Additionally profound differences in crystallization characteristics are discovered between ITIC&#8208;2F and ITIC&#8208;2Cl. The differences as observed by secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and microscopy can be related directly to device degradation and are attributed to the significantly different nucleation and growth rates, with a difference in the growth rate of a factor of 12 at RT. ITIC&#8208;4F and ITIC&#8208;4Cl exhibit similar characteristics. The results reveal the importance of diffusion coefficients and melting enthalpies in controlling the growth rates, and that differences in halogenation can drastically change crystallization kinetics and device stability. It is furthermore delineated how low nucleation density and large growth rates can be inferred from DSC and microscopy experiments which could be used to guide molecular design for stability.

      <title>Composite Nanostructure Construction on the Grain Surface of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>
A composite nanostructure comprising a uniform LiTaO3 coating layer and the oriented growth of a spinel interlayer structure is constructed on the grain surface of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The surface composite nanostructure modification can significantly improve the voltage maintenance, cycle stability, rate performance, and thermal stability of LLOs.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) are fascinating high&#8208;energy cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but still suffer from critical drawbacks that retard their practical applications. Although surface modification is effective to protect LLOs from structural deterioration, the delicate design of structures on a grain surface with promising scalability for industrial application is still challenging. Herein, using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, a composite nanostructure comprising a uniform LiTaO3 coating layer (&#8776;3 nm) and a spinel interlayer structure (&#8776;1 nm) is constructed on the grain surface of industrial LLO (Li1.13Mn0.517Ni0.256Co0.097O2) agglomerated spheres. The surface composite nanostructure can not only enhance the structural/interfacial stability of the LLO, but also facilitates Li+ diffusion, thereby significantly improving its cycle stability, rate performance, thermal stability, and voltage maintenance. Specifically, the LLO coated with 10 ALD cycles exhibits a small voltage decay rate of 0.9 mV per cycle, a reversible capacity of 272.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, and a capacity retention of 85% after 200 cycles at 1 C, suggesting the important role of surface composite nanostructure for improving the electrochemical performance. This work provides new insights into the composite nanostructure design on the grain surface of cathode materials for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

      <title>Preferentially Engineering FeN4 Edge Sites onto Graphitic Nanosheets for Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Edge&#8208;enriched FeN4 site integration into the highly graphitic nanosheet architecture is developed for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis in rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Benefiting from the structural merits, the as&#8208;developed catalyst displays impressive performance in a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery prototype with a low charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap of 0.78&#160;V and long&#8208;term cyclability for over 240 cycles.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom FeN4 sites at the edges of carbon substrates are considered more active for oxygen electrocatalysis than those in plane; however, the conventional high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis process does not allow for precisely engineering the location of the active site down to atomic level. Enlightened by theoretical prediction, herein, a self&#8208;sacrificed templating approach is developed to obtain edge&#8208;enriched FeN4 sites integrated in the highly graphitic nanosheet architecture. The in situ formed Fe clusters are intentionally introduced to catalyze the growth of graphitic carbon, induce porous structure formation, and most importantly, facilitate the preferential anchoring of FeN4 to its close approximation. Due to these attributes, the as&#8208;resulted catalyst (denoted as Fe/N&#8208;G&#8208;SAC) demonstrates unprecedented catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by showing an impressive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V for the ORR and a small overpotential of 370&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the OER. Moreover, the Fe/N&#8208;G&#8208;SAC cathode displays encouraging performance in a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery prototype with a low charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap of 0.78&#160;V and long&#8208;term cyclability for over 240 cycles, outperforming the noble metal benchmarks.

      <title>Structural Insight in the Interfacial Effect in Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
Using atomic force microscopy&#8211;infrared spectroscopy together with first&#8208;principles calculations and phase field simulations, a spatial structure analysis of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites is provided. The unprecedented insights into the interfacial coupling effect at the molecular level would enable interfacial engineering strategies to realize improved properties and unlock new functionalities of the nanocomposites.








Abstract
Both experimental results and theoretical models suggest the decisive role of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces on the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and electrocaloric properties of ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites. However, there remains a lack of direct structural evidence to support the so&#8208;called interfacial effect in dielectric nanocomposites. Here, a chemical mapping of the interfacial coupling between the nanofiller and the polymer matrix in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites by combining atomic force microscopy&#8211;infrared spectroscopy (AFM&#8211;IR) with first&#8208;principles calculations and phase&#8208;field simulations is provided. The addition of ceramic fillers into a ferroelectric polymer leads to augmentation of the local conformational disorder in the vicinity of the interface, resulting in the local stabilization of the all&#8208;trans conformation (i.e., the polar &#946; phase). The formation of highly polar and inhomogeneous interfacial regions, which is further enhanced with a decrease of the filler size, has been identified experimentally and verified by phase&#8208;field simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work offers unprecedented structural insights into the configurational disorder&#8208;induced interfacial effect and will enable rational design and molecular engineering of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces of electroactive polymer nanocomposites to boost their collective properties.

However, there remains a lack of direct structural evidence to support the so&#8208;called interfacial effect in dielectric nanocomposites. Here, a chemical mapping of the interfacial coupling between the nanofiller and the polymer matrix in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites by combining atomic force microscopy&#8211;infrared spectroscopy (AFM&#8211;IR) with first&#8208;principles calculations and phase&#8208;field simulations is provided. The addition of ceramic fillers into a ferroelectric polymer leads to augmentation of the local conformational disorder in the vicinity of the interface, resulting in the local stabilization of the all&#8208;&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; conformation (i.e., the polar &#946; phase). The formation of highly polar and inhomogeneous interfacial regions, which is further enhanced with a decrease of the filler size, has been identified experimentally and verified by phase&#8208;field simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work offers unprecedented structural insights into the configurational disorder&#8208;induced interfacial effect and will enable rational design and molecular engineering of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces of electroactive polymer nanocomposites to boost their collective properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanomaterials with Supramolecular Assembly Based on AIE Luminogens for Theranostic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanotheranostics, constructed from aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens via supramolecular assembly, have been extensively studied during the past decades and exhibit great potential in personalized and precision medicine. This advanced strategy also facilitates the development of integrated systems combining diagnosis and therapy.








Abstract
One of the major pursuits of biomedical science is to develop advanced strategies for theranostics, which is expected to be an effective approach for achieving the transition from conventional medicine to precision medicine. Supramolecular assembly can serve as a powerful tool in the development of nanotheranostics with accurate imaging of tumors and real&#8208;time monitoring of the therapeutic process upon the incorporation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ability. AIE luminogens (AIEgens) will not only enable fluorescence imaging but will also aid in improving the efficacy of therapies. Furthermore, the fluorescent signals and therapeutic performance of these nanomaterials can be manipulated precisely owing to the reversible and stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics of the supramolecular systems. Inspired by rapid advances in this field, recent research conducted on nanotheranostics with the AIE effect based on supramolecular assembly is summarized. Here, three representative strategies for supramolecular nanomaterials are presented as follows: a) supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of AIEgens, b) the loading of AIEgens within nanocarriers with supramolecular assembly, and c) supramolecular macrocycle&#8208;guided assembly via host&#8211;guest interactions. Meanwhile, the diverse applications of such nanomaterials in diagnostics and therapeutics have also been discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges of this field are listed in this review.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Photocatalysts Optimized by Spatially Separated Cocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
A heterostructured photocatalyst, Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (PUM), is constructed based on the rational optimization of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 with spatially separated Pt and MnOx nanoparticles as cocatalysts. The optimization results in a long lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the composite, which can drive overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation and utilization are critical factors in photocatalysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that the complete spatial separation of oxidation and reduction cocatalysts enhances the efficacy of charge separation and surface reaction. Specifically, a Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (PUM) heterostructured photocatalyst with Pt and MnOx as cocatalysts is designed for the optimization of the NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 photocatalyst. Compared with the pristine NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (PU), and NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (UM) samples, the PUM sample exhibits the highest hydrogen production activity. As cocatalysts, Pt favors trapping of electrons, while MnOx tends to collect holes. Upon generation from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, electrons and holes flow inward and outward of the metal&#8211;organic framework photocatalyst, accumulating on the corresponding cocatalysts, and then take part in the redox reactions. The PUM photocatalyst greatly prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes, which favors the electron&#8211;hole separation. Furthermore, the PUM sample facilitates overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents, thereby demonstrating its potential as a modification method of MOF&#8208;type semiconductors for the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction.

      <title>Designing Advanced In Situ Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Wide Temperature Operation of 4.5 V Li||LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 cathodes are highly desirable for various energy&#8208;storage applications, especially when coupled with lithium metal anodes. Fluorine&#8208;rich electrode/electrolyte interphases in situ formed in an advanced ether electrolyte is found to enable highly stable cell cycling under elevated temperatures. Those interphases effectively suppress electrolyte side reactions and preserve the integrity of both cathode and anode materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with a LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode are of significant importance to the energy&#8208;storage market, especially for portable electronics. However, their development is greatly limited by the inferior performance under high voltages and challenging temperatures. Here, highly stable lithium (Li) metal batteries with LCO cathode, through the design of in situ formed, stable electrode/electrolyte interphases on both the Li anode and the LCO cathode, with an advanced electrolyte, are reported. The LCO cathode can deliver a high specific capacity of &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1 and show greatly improved cell performances under a high charge voltage of 4.5&#160;V (even up to 4.55&#160;V) and a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 55&#160;&#176;C. This work points out a promising approach for developing Li||LCO batteries for practical applications. This approach can also be used to improve the high&#8208;voltage performance of other batteries in a broad temperature range.

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Molecular Packing Explain Performance and Processing Procedures of Three D18:NFA Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular packing and thermodynamic properties of D18&#8208;based fullerene&#8208;free organic solar cells are studied. The D18 polymer exhibits strong chain extension in films, which is beneficial to charge transport. Miscibility and other characterizations explain the disparate performance of three systems and the processing procedures.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18:Y6 have recently exhibited a record power conversion efficiency of over 18%. The initial work is extended and the device performance of D18&#8208;based OSCs is compared with three non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, Y6, IT&#8208;4F, and IEICO&#8208;4Cl, and their molecular packing characteristics and miscibility are studied. The D18 polymer shows unusually strong chain extension and excellent backbone ordering in all films, which likely contributes to the excellent hole&#8208;transporting properties. Thermodynamic characterization indicates a room&#8208;temperature miscibility for D18:Y6 and D18:IT&#8208;4F near the percolation threshold. This corresponds to an ideal quench depth and explains the use of solvent vapor annealing rather than thermal annealing. In contrast, D18:IEICO&#8208;4Cl is a low&#8208;miscibility system with a deep quench depth during casting and poor morphology control and low performance. A failure of ternary blends with PC71BM is likely due to the near&#8208;ideal miscibility of Y6 to begin with and indicates that strategies for developing successful ternary or quaternary solar cells are likely very different for D18 than for other high&#8208;performing donors. This work reveals several unique property&#8211;performance relations of D18&#8208;based photovoltaic devices and helps guide design or fabrication of yet higher efficiency OSCs.

      <title>Engineering of Living Cells with Polyphenol&#8208;Functionalized Biologically Active Nanocomplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple, adaptable polyphenol&#8208;based molecular engineering platform &#8220;Cellnex&#8221; is reported as a rapid and efficient approach to functionalize cell surfaces with biomolecules. This platform enables the customized engineering of a wide range of mammalian cells with diverse classes of biomolecules.

Abstract
Approaches to safely and effectively augment cellular functions without compromising the inherent biological properties of the cells, especially through the integration of biologically labile domains, remain of great interest. Here, a versatile strategy to assemble biologically active nanocomplexes, including proteins, DNA, mRNA, and even viral carriers, on cellular surfaces to generate a cell&#8208;based hybrid system referred to as &#8220;Cellnex&#8221; is established. This strategy can be used to engineer a wide range of cell types used in adoptive cell transfers, including erythrocytes, macrophages, NK cells, T cells, etc. Erythrocytenex can enhance the delivery of cargo proteins to the lungs in vivo by 11&#8208;fold as compared to the free cargo counterpart. Biomimetic microfluidic experiments and modeling provided detailed insights into the targeting mechanism. In addition, Macrophagenex is capable of enhancing the therapeutic efficiency of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint inhibitors in vivo. This simple and adaptable approach may offer a platform for the rapid generation of complex cellular systems.

This strategy can be used to engineer a wide range of cell types used in adoptive cell transfers, including erythrocytes, macrophages, NK cells, T cells, etc. Erythrocyte&lt;sub&gt;nex&lt;/sub&gt; can enhance the delivery of cargo proteins to the lungs in vivo by 11&#8208;fold as compared to the free cargo counterpart. Biomimetic microfluidic experiments and modeling provided detailed insights into the targeting mechanism. In addition, Macrophage&lt;sub&gt;nex&lt;/sub&gt; is capable of enhancing the therapeutic efficiency of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint inhibitors in vivo. This simple and adaptable approach may offer a platform for the rapid generation of complex cellular systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
The excellent metallic conductivity of MXenes has elevated them to the forefront of a wide range of applications. The performance of highly conductive MXenes is comparable to that of conductive metals, and superior to many carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials for electromagnetic shielding, conducting electrodes, sensors, and thermal heaters. A brief overview of the mentioned application areas is presented.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, known as MXenes, have attracted considerable global research interest owing to their outstanding electrical conductivity coupled with light weight, flexibility, transparency, surface chemistry tunability, and easy solution processability. Here, the promising abilities of 2D MXenes, from both experimental and theoretical perspectives, for designing conductive materials for a range of applications, including electromagnetic interference shielding, flexible optoelectronics, sensors, and thermal heaters, are presented.

      <title>100 m Long Thermally Drawn Supercapacitor Fibers with Applications to 3D Printing and Textiles</title>
      <dc:description>
A flow&#8208;based preform&#8208;to&#8208;fiber (top&#8208;down) thermal drawing process is used in which a preform of macroscale dimensions, assembled with all the five component materials, is thermally drawn into 100 m lengths of fully functional supercapacitor fiber. The cell architecture is designed to address the mechanical, environmental, electrical, and storage requirements of a textile and 3D printed energy&#8208;storage device.








Abstract
Supercapacitor fibers, with short charging times, long cycle lifespans, and high power densities, hold promise for powering flexible fabric&#8208;based electronics. To date, however, only short lengths of functioning fiber supercapacitors have been produced. The primary goal of this study is to introduce a supercapacitor fiber that addresses the remaining challenges of scalability, flexibility, cladding impermeability, and performance at length. This is achieved through a top&#8208;down fabrication method in which a macroscale preform is thermally drawn into a fully functional energy&#8208;storage fiber. The preform consists of five components: thermally reversible porous electrode and electrolyte gels; conductive polymer and copper microwire current collectors; and an encapsulating hermetic cladding. This process produces 100 m of continuous functional supercapacitor fiber, orders of magnitude longer than any previously reported. In addition to flexibility (5 mm radius of curvature), moisture resistance (100 washing cycles), and strength (68&#160;MPa), these fibers have an energy density of 306 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 at 3.0&#160;V and &#8776;100% capacitance retention over 13&#160;000 cycles at 1.6&#160;V. To demonstrate the utility of this fiber, it is machine&#8208;woven and used as filament for 3D printing.

      <title>Coloring Afterglow Nanoparticles for High&#8208;Contrast Time&#8208;Gating&#8208;Free Multiplex Luminescence Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Multicolor afterglow nanoparticles (AGNPs) are synthesized via a straightforward template method. Such multicolor AGNPs exhibit a series of tunable afterglow emissions, including blue, yellow, green, and white. They can perform as a novel optical toolbox for high&#8208;contrast multichannel afterglow imaging in vitro and in vivo without the use of any complicated time&#8208;gating algorithms or systems.








Abstract
Afterglow nanoparticles (AGNPs) possessing inherently long lifetime with tailorable emission colors and uniform size have long been sought due to their time&#8208;gating&#8208;free high&#8208;contrast multiplexing imaging. Herein, via a straightforward template method, it is reported that such multicolor AGNPs can be accomplished. The resultant AGNPs exhibit a series of tunable afterglow emissions, including blue, yellow, green, and white. These multicolor AGNPs are found to be highly bright, enabling them to perform high&#8208;contrast multichannel afterglow imaging in vitro and in vivo without the use of any complicated time&#8208;gating algorithms or systems, which existing tools are unable to do.

      <title>Visualizing Tailored Spin Phenomena in a Reduced&#8208;Dimensional Topological Superlattice</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological states with tailored spin phenomena are realized in a reduced&#8208;dimensional superlattice structure, (&#9633;/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N or Bi2/Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N (N is the repeating unit) by controlling different terminations via molecular beam epitaxy. This work suggests a promising route of engineering topological superlattices for efficient spin&#8211;charge transducers and long&#8208;lived spin transport spintronic applications.








Abstract
Emergent topological insulators (TIs) and their design are in high demand for manipulating and transmitting spin information toward ultralow&#8208;power&#8208;consumption spintronic applications. Here, distinct topological states with tailored spin properties can be achieved in a single reduced&#8208;dimensional TI&#8208;superlattice, (Bi2/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N or (&#9633;/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N (N is the repeating unit, &#9633; represents an empty layer) by controlling the termination via molecular beam epitaxy. The Bi2&#8208;terminated superlattice exhibits a single Dirac cone with a spin momentum splitting &#8776;0.5 &#197;&#8722;1, producing a pronounced inverse Edelstein effect with a coherence length up to 1.26&#160;nm. In contrast, the Bi2Se3&#8208;terminated superlattice is identified as a dual TI protected by coexisting time reversal and mirror symmetries, showing an unexpectedly long spin lifetime up to 1&#160;ns. The work elucidates the key role of dimensionality and dual topological phases in selecting desired spin properties, suggesting a promise route for engineering topological superlattices for high&#8208;performance TI&#8208;spintronic devices.

      <title>Charge&#8211;Ferroelectric Transition in Ultrathin Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 Flakes Probed via a Dual&#8208;Gated Full van der Waals Transistor</title>
      <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;gated MoS2 ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor in full van der Waals structure is demonstrated with a thin Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 flake as the ferroelectric gate dielectric. Hysteresis behaviors can be electrostatically controlled by dual&#8208;gating from charge dynamic (clockwise) to ferroelectric (counterclockwise). This allows a multi&#8208;functional device with its operation switchable from short&#8208;term memory to nonvolatile ferroelectric memory.








Abstract
Ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) have recently attracted enormous attention owing to their applications in nonvolatile memories and low&#8208;power logic electronics. However, the current mainstream thin&#8208;film&#8208;based ferroelectrics lack good compatibility with the emergent 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In this work, the synthesis of thin ferroelectric Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 (NBIT) flakes by a molten&#8208;salt method is reported. With a dry&#8208;transferred NBIT flake serving as the top&#8208;gate dielectric, dual&#8208;gate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) FeFETs are fabricated in a full vdW stacking structure. Barrier&#8208;free graphene contacts allow the investigation of intrinsic carrier transport of MoS2 governed by lattice scattering. Thanks to the high dielectric constant of &#8776;94 in NBIT, a metal to insulator transition with a high electron concentration of 3.0 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2 is achieved in MoS2 under top&#8208;gate modulation. The electron field&#8208;effect mobility as high as 182 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 88 K is obtained. The as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 FeFET exhibits clockwise hysteresis transfer curves that originate from charge trapping/release with either top&#8208;gate or back&#8208;gate modulation. Interestingly, hysteresis behavior can be controlled from clockwise to counterclockwise using dual&#8208;gate. A multifunctional device utilizing this unique property of NBIT, which is switchable electrostatically between short&#8208;term memory and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory, is envisaged.

Barrier&#8208;free graphene contacts allow the investigation of intrinsic carrier transport of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; governed by lattice scattering. Thanks to the high dielectric constant of &#8776;94 in NBIT, a metal to insulator transition with a high electron concentration of 3.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under top&#8208;gate modulation. The electron field&#8208;effect mobility as high as 182 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 88 K is obtained. The as&#8208;fabricated MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; FeFET exhibits clockwise hysteresis transfer curves that originate from charge trapping/release with either top&#8208;gate or back&#8208;gate modulation. Interestingly, hysteresis behavior can be controlled from clockwise to counterclockwise using dual&#8208;gate. A multifunctional device utilizing this unique property of NBIT, which is switchable electrostatically between short&#8208;term memory and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory, is envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Criteria for Realizing Room&#8208;Temperature Electrical Transport Applications of Topological Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
What does it take to make a room&#8208;temperature electronic device based on the unusual states found in topological materials? As shown here, the answer is a materials&#8208;redesign, which delicately balances bandgap, dielectric constant, and effective mass. Identifying this new generation of materials can pave the way to realistic quantum technologies.








Abstract
The unusual electronic states found in topological materials can enable a new generation of devices and technologies, yet a long&#8208;standing challenge has been finding materials without deleterious parallel bulk conduction. This can arise either from defects or thermally activated carriers. Here, the criteria that materials need to meet to realize transport properties dominated by the topological states, a necessity for a topological device, are clarified. This is demonstrated for 3D topological insulators, 3D Dirac materials, and 1D quantum anomalous Hall insulators, though this can be applied to similar systems. The key parameters are electronic bandgap, dielectric constant, and carrier effective mass, which dictate under what circumstances (defect density, temperature, etc.) the unwanted bulk state will conduct in parallel to the topological states. As these are fundamentally determined by the basic atomic properties, simple chemical arguments can be used to navigate the phase space to ultimately find improved materials. This will enable rapid identification of new systems with improved properties, which is crucial to designing new material systems and push a new generation of topological technologies.

      <dc:description>
Highly selective and cost&#8208;effective separation of light hydrocarbons is of vital importance for the petrochemical industry. In light of their tunable porosity and functionality, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for the adsorptive separation of hydrocarbons with high similarity. Tailored MOFs with optimal pore size and shape can be achieved for the most efficient separation of light hydrocarbons through molecular sieving, as reviewed by Jing Li and co&#8208;workers in article number 2002603.

      <title>Photocatalysts: Steering Hollow Multishelled Structures in Photocatalysis: Optimizing Surface and Mass Transport (Adv. Mater. 44/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002556, Shouhua Feng, Dan Wang, and co&#8208;workers give an overview of rational design to elevate the photocatalytic performance of hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) by surface and mass&#8208;transfer optimization. Enlarged effective surface areas and the boosted mass transport in HoMSs greatly favor the energy/mass transfer processes in photocatalysis. In addition, specific structural and compositional parameters affecting photocatalytic performance are described, along with proposed guidance for the development directions of HoMS photocatalysts.

      <title>Stable Potassium Metal Anodes with an All&#8208;Aluminum Current Collector through Improved Electrolyte Wetting</title>
      <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free electrochemical cycling of potassium metal anodes is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting on a geometrically rough all&#8208;aluminum current collector. The electrolyte was standard potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane and no modifications were made to the collector surface chemistry. The key takeaway from this study is that good electrolyte wetting is necessary for stable plating/stripping, with poor wetting ensuring instability and dendrite growth.








Abstract
This is the first report of successful potassium metal battery anode cycling with an aluminum&#8208;based rather than copper&#8208;based current collector. Dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting, employing an aluminum&#8208;powder&#8208;coated aluminum foil &#8220;Al@Al,&#8221; without any modification of the support surface chemistry or electrolyte additives. The reservoir&#8208;free Al@Al half&#8208;cell is stable at 1000 cycles (1950&#160;h) at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with 98.9% cycling Coulombic efficiency and 0.085&#160;V overpotential. The pre&#8208;potassiated cell is stable through a wide current range, including 130&#160;cycles (2600 min) at 3.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with 0.178&#160;V overpotential. Al@Al is fully wetted by a 4 m potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte (&#952;CA&#160;= 0&#176;), producing a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the initial galvanostatic formation cycles. On planar aluminum foil with a nearly identical surface oxide, the electrolyte wets poorly (&#952;CA&#160;= 52&#176;). This correlates with coarse irregular SEI clumps at formation, 3D potassium islands with further SEI coarsening during plating/stripping, possibly dead potassium metal on stripped surfaces, and rapid failure. The electrochemical stability of Al@Al versus planar Al is not related to differences in potassiophilicity (nearly identical) as obtained from thermal wetting experiments. Planar Cu foils are also poorly electrolyte&#8208;wetted and become dendritic. The key fundamental takeaway is that the incomplete electrolyte wetting of collectors results in early onset of SEI instability and dendrites.

      <title>Lattice&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Enhanced Yield Strength in a Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
      <dc:description>
The lattice distortions of the NbTaTiV and NbTaTiVZr refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are quantitatively calculated and measured by various techniques. The relationship between the lattice distortion and yield strength is clearly demonstrated by the addition of Zr elements in an NbTaTiV HEA, resulting in an enhanced yield strength due to the increased lattice distortion.








Abstract
Severe distortion is one of the four core effects in single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) and contributes significantly to the yield strength. However, the connection between the atomic&#8208;scale lattice distortion and macro&#8208;scale mechanical properties through experimental verification has yet to be fully achieved, owing to two critical challenges: 1) the difficulty in the development of homogeneous single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution HEAs and 2) the ambiguity in describing the lattice distortion and related measurements and calculations. A single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) refractory HEA, NbTaTiVZr, using thermodynamic modeling coupled with experimental verifications, is developed. Compared to the previously developed single&#8208;phase NbTaTiV HEA, the NbTaTiVZr HEA shows a higher yield strength and comparable plasticity. The increase in yield strength is systematically and quantitatively studied in terms of lattice distortion using a theoretical model, first&#8208;principles calculations, synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction, atom&#8208;probe tomography, and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. These results demonstrate that severe lattice distortion is a core factor for developing high strengths in refractory HEAs.

      <title>Periodic Wrinkle&#8208;Patterned Single&#8208;Crystalline Ferroelectric Oxide Membranes with Enhanced Piezoelectricity</title>
      <dc:description>
Freestanding BaTiO3 membranes (ferroelastic oxides) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer (organism) are combined to construct a periodically wrinkled structure. The wrinkle&#8208;patterned ferroelectric membranes offer an ideal platform to explore strain&#8208;correlated fundamental phenomena such as flexoelectricity, strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric domain evolutions, and phase transitions, as well as the periodic electric potential induced functions in flexible optical and electrical devices.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled membranes with periodic wrinkled patterns are the critical building blocks of various flexible electronics, where the wrinkles are usually designed and fabricated to provide distinct functionalities. These membranes are typically metallic and organic materials with good ductility that are tolerant of complex deformation. However, the preparation of oxide membranes, especially those with intricate wrinkle patterns, is challenging due to their inherently strong covalent or ionic bonding, which usually leads to material crazing and brittle fracture. Here, wrinkle&#8208;patterned BaTiO3 (BTO)/poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes with finely controlled parallel, zigzag, and mosaic patterns are prepared. The BTO layers show excellent flexibility and can form well&#8208;ordered and periodic wrinkles under compressive in&#8208;plane stress. Enhanced piezoelectricity is observed at the sites of peaks and valleys of the wrinkles where the largest strain gradient is generated. Atomistic simulations further reveal that the excellent elasticity and the correlated coupling between polarization and strain/strain gradient are strongly associated with ferroelectric domain switching and continuous dipole rotation. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is primarily generated at compressive regions, while the in&#8208;plane polarization dominates at the tensile regions. The wrinkled ferroelectric oxides with differently strained regions and correlated polarization distributions would pave a way toward novel flexible electronics.

      <title>Discovering Electron&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Driven Changes in Chemical Bonding in Lead Chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S, O)</title>
      <dc:description>
Systematic changes of chemical bonding are studied in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X&#160;= Te, Se, S, O) to comprehend their properties. The exploration reveals an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X&#160;=&#160;Te,&#160;Se,&#160;S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO. The insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.








Abstract
Understanding the nature of chemical bonding in solids is crucial to comprehend the physical and chemical properties of a given compound. To explore changes in chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X&#160;= Te, Se, S, O), a combination of property&#8208;, bond&#8208;breaking&#8208;, and quantum&#8208;mechanical bonding descriptors are applied. The outcome of the explorations reveals an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X = Te, Se, S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO. Metavalent bonding is characterized by adjacent atoms being held together by sharing about a single electron (ES &#8776; 1) and small electron transfer (ET). The transition from metavalent to iono&#8208;covalent bonding manifests itself in clear changes in these quantum&#8208;mechanical descriptors (ES and ET), as well as in property&#8208;based descriptors (i.e., Born effective charge (Z*), dielectric function &#949;(&#969;), effective coordination number (ECoN), and mode&#8208;specific Gr&#252;neisen parameter (&#947;TO)), and in bond&#8208;breaking descriptors. Metavalent bonding collapses if significant charge localization occurs at the ion cores (ET) and/or in the interatomic region (ES). Predominantly changing the degree of electron transfer opens possibilities to tailor material properties such as the chemical bond (Z*) and electronic (&#949;&#8734;) polarizability, optical bandgap, and optical interband transitions characterized by &#949;2(&#969;). Hence, the insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.

Metavalent bonding collapses if significant charge localization occurs at the ion cores (ET) and/or in the interatomic region (ES). Predominantly changing the degree of electron transfer opens possibilities to tailor material properties such as the chemical bond (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;*) and electronic (&#949;&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;) polarizability, optical bandgap, and optical interband transitions characterized by &#949;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#969;). Hence, the insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improvement of Electrical Conductivity in Conjugated Polymers through Cascade Doping with Small&#8208;Molecular Dopants</title>
      <dc:description>
An outstanding electrical conductivity (&gt;610 S cm&#8722;1) is achieved through the optimization of a devised doping strategy with conjugated polymers (CPs) which contains electron&#8208;donating S and N atoms together in its conjugated skeleton. The cascade doping approach is expected to be readily applicable to many useful CP developments for outperforming organic conductors.








Abstract
Doping capability is primitively governed by the energy level offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of conjugated polymers (CPs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of dopants. A poor doping efficiency is obtained when doping directly using NOBF4 forming a large energy offset with the CP, while the devised doping strategy is found to significantly improve the doping efficiency (electrical conductivity) by sequentially treating the NOBF4 to the pre&#8208;doped CP with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquino&#8208;dimethane (F4TCNQ), establishing a relatively small energy level offset. It is verified that the cascade doping strategy requires receptive sites for each dopant to further improve the doping efficiency, and provides fast reaction kinetics energetically. An outstanding electrical conductivity (&gt;610 S cm&#8722;1) is achieved through the optimization of the devised doping strategy, and spectroscopy analysis, including Hall effect measurement, supports more efficient charge carrier generation via the devised cascade doping.

      <title>Low&#8208;Cost Titanium&#8211;Bromine Flow Battery with Ultrahigh Cycle Stability for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
A long&#8208;cycle and low&#8208;cost titanium&#8211;bromine flow battery is achieved with the help of a novel bromine complexing agent (CHA) and a porous polyolefin membrane. CHA can not only capture the polybromides with a large size excluded by a membrane but also can keep the positive electrolyte in the nearly homogeneous phase, which endows the battery with outstanding stability.








Abstract
Flow batteries are one of the most promising large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems. However, the currently used flow batteries have low operation&#8211;cost&#8208;effectiveness and exhibit low energy density, which limits their commercialization. Herein, a titanium&#8211;bromine flow battery (TBFB) featuring very low operation cost and outstanding stability is reported. In this battery, a novel complexing agent, 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, is employed to stabilize bromine/polybromides and suppress Br diffusion. The results reveal that the complexing agent effectively inhibits Br crossover and reduces Br&#8208;induced corrosivity, which in turn significantly improves the reliability of the TBFB system. The novel TBFB demonstrates 95% coulombic efficiency and 83% energy efficiency at 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density. Moreover, it can run smoothly for more than 1000 cycles without any capacity decay. Furthermore, an assembled 300 W TBFB stack can be continuously operated for more than 500 cycles, thereby confirming the practical applicability of the proposed TBFB. Because the TBFB utilizes an ultralow&#8208;cost electrolyte (41.29&#160;$&#160;kWh&#8722;1) and porous polyolefin membranes, it serves as a reliable and low&#8208;cost energy&#8208;storage device. Therefore, considering its ultrahigh stability and low cost, the TBFB can be used as a large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage device.

      <dc:description>
The main aspects of the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are summarized, clarifying the challenges and opportunities for researchers. As the EMSI directly affects the electronic state of the catalysts, the deep principles underlying the reaction are considered, which is important for determining the generality among all electrocatalytic reactions and understanding the fundamental laws that SACs obey in electrocatalysis.








Abstract
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI), which acts as a bridge between theoretical electronic study and the design of heterogenous catalysts, has attracted much attention. Utilizing the interaction between the metal and the support is one of the most essential strategies to enhance electrocatalytic efficiency due to structural and synergetic promotion. To date, as the ideal model for realizing EMSI, many types of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been developed. The understanding of the electronic interaction on SACs has also been pushed to a higher level. However, systematic theories and operando experiments are seldom reported, and will be necessary to put forward and be carried out, respectively. Herein, the types, characterization, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of EMSI are comprehensively summarized and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of the EMSI on SACs are also proposed to present an overall view and reference to the later research.

      <dc:description>
Dislocation&#8208;strained IrNi nanoparticles with competitive HER activity are realized by unsteady thermal shock progress in an extreme environment, and they are uniformly distributed within a carbon nanotube sponge (DSIrNi@CNTS). Numerous dislocations are generated in self&#8208;assembled IrNi nanoparticles due to ultrafast quenching, inducing strain effects into the IrNi nanoparticles, which optimize the electronic structure of the active sites.








Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts is crucial for the electrochemical production of hydrogen. Dislocation&#8208;strained IrNi nanoparticles loaded on a carbon nanotube sponge (DSIrNi@CNTS) driven by unsteady thermal shock in an extreme environment are reported here as a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. Experimental results demonstrate that numerous dislocations are kinetically trapped in self&#8208;assembled IrNi nanoparticles due to the ultrafast quenching and different atomic radii, which can induce strain effects into the IrNi nanoparticles. Such strain&#8208;induced high&#8208;energy surface structures arising from bulk defects (dislocations), are more likely to be resistant to surface restructuring during catalysis. The catalyst exhibits outstanding HER activity with only 17 mV overpotential to achieve 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline electrolyte with fabulous stability, exceeding state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts.&#160;These&#160;density functional theory results demonstrate that the electronic structure of as&#8208;synthesized IrNi nanostructure can be optimized by the strain effects induced by the dislocations, and the free energy of HER can be tuned toward the optimal region.

Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;based enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalysts (Enz&#8208;Cats) have received considerable attention because of their optimized and enhanced catalytic performances and selectivities in diverse physiological environments compared with natural enzymes. Recently, owing to their molecular/atomic&#8208;level catalytic centers, high porosity, large surface area, high loading capacity, and homogeneous structure, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as one of the most promising materials in engineering Enz&#8208;Cats. Here, the recent advances in the design of MOF&#8208;engineered Enz&#8208;Cats, including their preparation methods, composite constructions, structural characterizations, and biomedical applications, are highlighted and commented upon. In particular, the performance, selectivities, essential mechanisms, and potential structure&#8211;property relations of these MOF&#8208;engineered Enz&#8208;Cats in accelerating catalytic reactions are discussed. Some potential biomedical applications of these MOF&#8208;engineered Enz&#8208;Cats are also breifly proposed. These applications include, for example, tumor therapies, bacterial disinfection, tissue regeneration, and biosensors. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges in emerging research frontiers are thoroughly discussed. Thereby, potential pathways and perspectives for designing future state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Enz&#8208;Cats in biomedical sciences are offered.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Unidirectional Manipulation of Microdroplets by Horizontal Vibration on Femtosecond Laser&#8208;Induced Slant Microwall Arrays</title>
      <dc:description>
The high&#8208;performance unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets, such as multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90&#176; turning, and sequential transport), large&#8208;volume&#8208;range and high&#8208;speed transport, by horizontal vibration is achieved on a polymeric substrate with slant microgroove arrays fabricated by femtosecond laser oblique ablation technology, demonstrating great potential in the field of liquid microreactions.








Abstract
The high&#8208;performance unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets is crucial for many vital applications including water collection and bioanalysis. Among several actuation methods (e.g., electric, magnetic, light, and thermal actuation), mechanical vibration is pollution&#8208;free and biocompatible. However, it suffers from limited droplet movement mode, small volume range (VMax/VMin&#160;&lt;&#160;3), and low transport velocity (&#8804;11.5&#160;mm s&#8722;1) because the droplet motion is a sliding state caused by the vertical vibration on the asymmetric hydrophobic microstructures. Here, an alternative strategy is proposed&#8212;horizontal vibration for multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90o turning, and sequential transport), large&#8208;volume&#8208;range (VMax/VMin&#160;&#8776; 100), and high&#8208;speed (&#8776;22.86&#160;mm s&#8722;1) unidirectional microdroplet manipulation, which is ascribed to the rolling state on superhydrophobic slant microwall arrays (SMWAs) fabricated by the one&#8208;step femtosecond laser oblique ablation. The unidirectional transport mechanism relies on the variance of viscous resistance induced by the difference of contact area between the microdroplet and the slant microwalls. Furthermore, a circular, curved, and &#8220;L&#8221;&#8208;shaped SMWA is designed and fabricated for droplet motion with particular paths. Finally, sequential transport of large&#8208;volume&#8208;range droplets and chemical mixing microreaction of water&#8208;based droplets are demonstrated on the SMWA, which demonstrates the great potential in the field of microdroplet manipulation.

      <title>Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Ion&#8208;Responsive Antimicrobial Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
The functionalization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) can be achieved in a porphyrin&#8208;based anionic HOF structure, endowing the material with synergistic photodynamic and chemical antimicrobial efficacy. By further taking advantage of the unbonded carboxyl groups on the HOF particle surface, a freestanding flexible membrane that shows high permeability, good stability, and excellent antibacterial activity is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Functionalization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for specific applications has been a long&#8208;lasting challenge in HOF materials. Here, an efficient way to integrate functional species in the HOF structure through constructing an anionic framework is presented. The obtained HOFs, taking PFC&#8208;33 (PFC = porous materials from FJIRSM,CAS) as an example, integrate a porphyrin photosensitizer as a porous backbone and a commercial biocide as counterions in the structure. The permanent channels and the electrostatic interaction between the framework and the counterions provide PFC&#8208;33 ion&#8208;responsive biocide&#8208;release behavior in various physiological environments, thus exhibiting synergistic photodynamic and chemical antimicrobial efficiency. The unbonded carboxyl groups residing on the HOF surface further allow for manipulating the interfacial interaction between the PFC&#8208;33 and the polymer matrix for membrane fabrication. Therefore, a polyHOF membrane with high stability, desired flexibility, and good permeability is obtained, which demonstrates noticeable bacterial inhibition toward Escherichia coli. This study may shed light on the functionalization of HOF materials for broad application potentials.

      <title>Isotope Effect in the Magneto&#8208;Optoelectronic Response of Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Donor&#8211;Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence of donor&#8211;acceptor blends, both the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence response and electron magnetic resonance spectrum are found to be independent of the particular hydrogen isotope (protium or deuterium) present. This shows that the reverse intersystem crossing process from the triplet to singlet states occurs in the exciplex manifold rather than that of the polaron pair.








Abstract
The isotope effect is studied in the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence (MEL) and pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from donor&#8211;acceptor exciplexes that are either protonated (H) or deuterated (D). It is found that at ambient temperature, the exchange of H to D has no effect on the spin&#8208;dependent current and MEL responses in the devices. However, at cryogenic temperatures, where the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet exciplex diminishes, a pronounced isotope effect is observed. These results show that the RISC process is not governed by the hyperfine interaction as thought previously, but proceeds through spin&#8208;mixing in the triplet exciplex. The observations are corroborated by electrically detected transient spin nutation experiments that show relatively long dephasing time at ambient temperature, and interpreted in the context of a model that involves exchange and hyperfine interactions in the spin triplet exciplex. These findings deepen the understanding of the RISC process in TADF materials.

      <title>Promoted Photocharge Separation in 2D Lateral Epitaxial Heterostructure for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Photoreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
2D lateral heterostructure is in situ fabricated. Benefiting from the strong chemical bonding at the heterointerface, strong internal electric field is generated between two components of the heterostructure, which facilitates photoexcited charge separation and transfer kinetics, and results in improved solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Photocarrier recombination remains a big barrier for the improvement of solar energy conversion efficiency. For 2D materials, construction of heterostructures represents an efficient strategy to promote photoexcited carrier separation via an internal electric field at the heterointerface. However, due to the difficulty in seeking two components with suitable crystal lattice mismatch, most of the current 2D heterostructures are vertical heterostructures and the exploration of 2D lateral heterostructures is scarce and limited. Here, lateral epitaxial heterostructures of BiOCl&#8202;@&#8202;Bi2O3 at the atomic level are fabricated via sonicating&#8208;assisted etching of Cl in BiOCl. This unique lateral heterostructure expedites photoexcited charge separation and transportation through the internal electric field induced by chemical bonding at the lateral interface. As a result, the lateral BiOCl&#8202;@&#8202;Bi2O3 heterostructure demonstrates superior CO2 photoreduction properties with a CO yield rate of about 30&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible light illumination. The strategy to fabricate lateral epitaxial heterostructures in this work is expected to provide inspiration for preparing other 2D lateral heterostructures used in optoelectronic devices, energy conversion, and storage fields.

      <title>Microfabricated Ion&#8208;Selective Transistors with Fast and Super&#8208;Nernstian Response</title>
      <dc:description>
Microfabricated ion&#8208;selective transistors with fast response and super&#8208;Nernstian sensitivity are demonstrated. The remarkable performance arises from the use of a thin polyelectrolyte film as an internal ion reservoir between the ion&#8208;selective membrane and the organic electrochemical transistor. The sensor architecture is generic and applicable to sensing of various ions, opening new frontiers for wearable and implantable ion sensors.








Abstract
Transistor&#8208;based ion sensors have evolved significantly, but the best&#8208;performing ones rely on a liquid electrolyte as an internal ion reservoir between the ion&#8208;selective membrane and the channel. This liquid reservoir makes sensor miniaturization difficult and leads to devices that are bulky and have limited mechanical flexibility, which is holding back the development of high&#8208;performance wearable/implantable ion sensors. This work demonstrates microfabricated ion&#8208;selective organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with a transconductance of 4&#160;mS, in which a thin polyelectrolyte film with mobile sodium ions replaces the liquid reservoir. These devices are capable of selective detection of various ions with a fast response time (&#8776;1&#160;s), a super&#8208;Nernstian sensitivity (85&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), and a high current sensitivity (224&#160;&#181;A&#160;dec&#8722;1), comparing favorably to other ion sensors based on traditional and emerging materials. Furthermore, the ion&#8208;selective OECTs are stable with highly reproducible sensitivity even after 5 months. These characteristics pave the way for new applications in implantable and wearable electronics.

      <title>Highly Ordered 2D&#8208;Assemblies of Phase&#8208;Segregated Block Molecules for Upconverted Linearly Polarized Emission</title>
      <dc:description>
Triplet&#8208;energy&#8208;migration&#8208;based photon upconversion is demonstrated in films of 2D crystalline sheets of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene functionalized with discrete&#8208;length oligodimethylsiloxane. Annealing increases the upconverted photoluminescence intensity up to 100&#8208;fold due to increased chromophore ordering and enhanced donor dispersion. Upconversion imaging microscopy spatially resolves the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion intensity with micrometer resolution. Millimeter&#8208;sized domains show linearly polarized upconverted emission.








Abstract
Materials based on the laminar ordering of self&#8208;assembled molecules have a unique potential for applications requiring efficient energy migration through densely packed chromophores. Here, employing molecular assemblies of coil&#8211;rod&#8211;coil block molecules for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based on triplet energy migration with linearly polarized emission is reported. By covalently attaching discrete&#8208;length oligodimethylsiloxane (oDMS) to 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA), highly ordered 2D crystalline DPA sheets separated by oDMS layers are obtained. Transparent films of this material doped with small amounts of triplet sensitizer PtII octaethylporphyrin show air&#8208;stable TTA&#8208;UC under non&#8208;coherent excitation. Upon annealing, an increase in TTA&#8208;UC up to two orders of magnitude is observed originating from both an improved molecular ordering of DPA and an increased dispersion of the sensitizer. The molecular alignment in millimeter&#8208;sized domains leads to upconverted linearly polarized emission without alignment layers. By using a novel technique, upconversion imaging microscopy, the TTA&#8208;UC intensity is spatially resolved on a micrometer scale to visually demonstrate the importance of molecular dispersion of sensitizer molecules for efficient TTA&#8208;UC. The reported results are promising for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and 3D night&#8208;vision applications, but also exemplify the potential of discrete oligodimethylsiloxane functionalized chromophores for highly aligned and densely packed molecular materials.

      <title>Precisely Controlling the Position of Bromine on the End Group Enables Well&#8208;Regular Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiencies over 15%</title>
      <dc:description>
Two well&#8208;regular polymer acceptors (PY&#8208;IT and PY&#8208;OT) with different polymerization sites are developed. For comparison, a random ternary copolymer (PY&#8208;IOT) with the same ratio of the two acceptors is synthesized. All&#8208;polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT achieve an excellent PCE of 15.05%, which is significantly higher than those based on PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%).








Abstract
Recent advances in the development of polymerized A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) have promoted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) over 13%. However, the monomer of an SMA typically consists of a mixture of three isomers due to the regio&#8208;isomeric brominated end groups (IC&#8208;Br(in) and IC&#8208;Br(out)). In this work, the two isomeric end groups are successfully separated, the regioisomeric issue is solved, and three polymer acceptors, named PY&#8208;IT, PY&#8208;OT, and PY&#8208;IOT, are developed, where PY&#8208;IOT is a random terpolymer with the same ratio of the two acceptors. Interestingly, from PY&#8208;OT, PY&#8208;IOT to PY&#8208;IT, the absorption edge gradually redshifts and electron mobility progressively increases. Theory calculation indicates that the LUMOs are distributed on the entire molecular backbone of PY&#8208;IT, contributing to the enhanced electron transport. Consequently, the PM6:PY&#8208;IT system achieves an excellent PCE of 15.05%, significantly higher than those for PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%). Morphological and device characterization reveals that the highest PCE for the PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based device is the fruit of enhanced absorption, more balanced charge transport, and favorable morphology. This work demonstrates that the site of polymerization on SMAs strongly affects device performance, offering insights into the development of efficient polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs.

      <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via an Unconjugated Donor&#8211;Acceptor System Realizing EQE of Over 30%</title>
      <dc:description>
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter, 2tDMG, is designed and synthesized based on the donor (D)/acceptor (A) spatially intramolecular noncovalent interaction. The D/A units are connected via a rigid linker, thereby confining them into a close&#8208;packed coplanar configuration for small singlet&#8211;triplet splitting energy. 2tDMG achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 30.8% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off in evaporation&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).








Abstract
In this work, two novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, 2tDMG and 3tDMG, are synthesized for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), The two emitters have a tilted face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment of donor (D)/acceptor (A) units presenting intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The two TADF materials are deposited either by an evaporation&#8208;process or by a solution&#8208;process, both of them leading to high OLED performance. 2tDMG used as the emitter in evaporation&#8208;processed OLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.8% with a very flat efficiency roll&#8208;off of 7% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The solution&#8208;processed OLEDs also display an interesting EQE of 16.2%. 3tDMG shows improved solubility and solution processability as compared to 2tDMG, and thus a high EQE of 20.2% in solution&#8208;processed OLEDs is recorded. The corresponding evaporation&#8208;processed OLEDs also reach a reasonably high EQE of 26.3%. Encouragingly, this work provides a novel strategy to address the imperious demands for OLEDs with high EQE and low roll&#8208;off.

      <title>Controllable Magnetic Proximity Effect and Charge Transfer in 2D Semiconductor and Double&#8208;Layered Perovskite Manganese Oxide van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel van der Waals heterostructure consisting of monolayer MoSe2, Mn oxide, and a buffer layer (h&#8208;BN) demonstrates magnetic proximity and charge transfer effect for the excitonic states due to phase transition of Mn oxide from ferromagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator. The controllable thickness of h&#8208;BN reveals the characteristic length scale of several nanometers in magnetic proximity and charge transfer.








Abstract
Optically generated excitonic states (excitons and trions) in transition metal dichalcogenides are highly sensitive to the electronic and magnetic properties of the materials underneath. Modulation and control of the excitonic states in a novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of monolayer MoSe2 on double&#8208;layered perovskite Mn oxide ((La0.8Nd0.2)1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7) is demonstrated, wherein the Mn oxide transforms from a paramagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic metal. A discontinuous change in the exciton photoluminescence intensity via dielectric screening is observed. Further, a relatively high trion intensity is discovered due to the charge transfer from metallic Mn oxide under the Curie temperature. Moreover, the vdW heterostructures with an ultrathin h&#8208;BN spacer layer demonstrate enhanced valley splitting and polarization of excitonic states due to the proximity effect of the ferromagnetic spins of Mn oxide. The controllable h&#8208;BN thickness in vdW heterostructures reveals a several&#8208;nanometer&#8208;long scale of charge transfer as well as a magnetic proximity effect. The vdW heterostructure allows modulation and control of the excitonic states via dielectric screening, charge carriers, and magnetic spins.

The controllable thickness of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;BN reveals the characteristic length scale of several nanometers in magnetic proximity and charge transfer.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optically generated excitonic states (excitons and trions) in transition metal dichalcogenides are highly sensitive to the electronic and magnetic properties of the materials underneath. Modulation and control of the excitonic states in a novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of monolayer MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on double&#8208;layered perovskite Mn oxide ((La&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Nd&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) is demonstrated, wherein the Mn oxide transforms from a paramagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic metal. A discontinuous change in the exciton photoluminescence intensity via dielectric screening is observed. Further, a relatively high trion intensity is discovered due to the charge transfer from metallic Mn oxide under the Curie temperature. Moreover, the vdW heterostructures with an ultrathin &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;BN spacer layer demonstrate enhanced valley splitting and polarization of excitonic states due to the proximity effect of the ferromagnetic spins of Mn oxide. The controllable &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;BN thickness in vdW heterostructures reveals a several&#8208;nanometer&#8208;long scale of charge transfer as well as a magnetic proximity effect. The vdW heterostructure allows modulation and control of the excitonic states via dielectric screening, charge carriers, and magnetic spins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dirac Fermion Kinetics in 3D Curved Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
3D curved graphene with a wide range of curvature radii from 25 to 1000 nm demonstrates that nanoscale curvature is a new degree of freedom to tune the transport properties of graphene by manipulating 2D electron kinetics on 3D curved surfaces.








Abstract
3D integration of&#160;graphene has attracted attention for realizing&#160;carbon&#8208;based electronic devices. While the 3D integration can amplify various excellent properties of graphene, the influence of 3D curved surfaces on the fundamental physical properties of graphene has not been clarified. The electronic properties of 3D nanoporous graphene with a curvature radius down to 25&#8211;50 nm are systematically investigated and the ambipolar electronic states of Dirac fermions are essentially preserved in the 3D graphene nanoarchitectures, while the 3D curvature can effectively suppress the slope of the linear density of states of Dirac fermion near the Fermi level are demonstrated. Importantly, the 3D curvature can be utilized to tune the back&#8208;scattering&#8208;suppressed electrical transport of Dirac fermions and enhance&#160;both electron localization and electron&#8211;electron interaction. As a result, nanoscale curvature&#160;provides a new degree of freedom to manipulate&#160;3D graphene electrical properties, which may pave a new way to design new 3D graphene devices with preserved 2D electronic properties&#160;and novel functionalities.

      <title>A Tuned Alternating D&#8211;A Copolymer Hole&#8208;Transport Layer Enables Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Superior Fill Factor and Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
A new DPP&#8208;based alternating D&#8211;A copolymer (PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP) is developed for use as a hole&#8208;transport layer. PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP addresses the different requirements for an HTL, offering favorable energetics, near&#8208;infrared absorption, and efficient charge transfer. Therefore, a PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP&#8208;based device achieves a remarkable FF of 70% and the highest PCE of 14.0% among PbS CQD&#8208;SCs.








Abstract
The need for optoelectronic and chemical compatibility between the layers in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photovoltaic devices remains a bottleneck in further increasing performance. Conjugated polymers are promising candidates as new hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) materials in CQD solar cells (CQD&#8208;SCs) owing to the highly tunable optoelectronic properties and compatible chemistries. A diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer with benzothiadiazole derivatives (PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP) as an HTL in these devices is reported. The energy level, molecular orientation, and hole mobility of this HTL are manipulated through molecular engineering. By levering the polymer's optical absorption spectrum complementary to that of the CQD active layer, EQE across the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions is maximized. As a result, a PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP&#8208;based device exhibits a fill factor of 70% and approximately 35% efficiency enhancement compared to a PTB7&#8208;based device.

      <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Functionalized Sonodynamic Treatment for Improving Therapeutic Efficacy and Compliance of Orthotopic Oral Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
Nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is developed for the treatment of oral cancer with good compliance. An ultrasound&#8208;responsive mesenchymal stem cells membrane functionalized liposome is designed for co&#8208;delivery of sonosensitizer and oxygen, which not only increases tumor targeting and penetration but also supplies oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, resulting in prolonged survival and maintenance of oral functions.








Abstract
Despite multiple treatment options being available, many critical challenges are still ongoing in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Particularly, the major hurdle is to avoid facial disfigurement and oral function disability during treatment. Herein, nanoengineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are developed as a supersonosensitizer, named M/LPV/O2, for improving nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) against OSCC along with good therapeutic compliance. M/LPV/O2 is composed of an MSCs membrane functionalized liposomal formulation of oxygen&#8208;loading perfluorocarbon and sonosensitizer verteporfin (M/LPV/O2), which can not only increase circulation and targeting efficacy but also supply oxygen to overcome tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;associated resistance in SDT, resulting in enhanced therapeutic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. It is identified that M/LPV/O2 effectively stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species even in hypoxic conditions, and consequently tremendously induces cancer cell death. In addition, M/LPV/O2 displays good tumor accumulation and penetration under ultrasound stimulation, and efficiently induces tumor inhibition and even abrogation, leading to prolonged survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Importantly, M/LPV/O2&#8208;based SDT exhibits minimal systemic adverse effects and successfully maintains oral functions with no facial tissue damage. Therefore, these studies provide a promising therapeutic strategy for OSCC, which has a potential to enhance life quality and compliance after treatment.
