         <title>Toposelective Functionalization of Solution&#8208;Processed Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Metal Nanoparticles via Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy for toposelective functionalization of solution&#8208;processed transition metal dichalcogenides with noble metal nanoparticles via galvanic displacement. Owing to the selective edge decoration with gold, palladium, or platinum nanoparticles, the hybrid materials exhibit new properties and improved device performance in sensing, electrocatalysis, and electronics. This approach exploits a defect engineering strategy to produce multifunctional mixed&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides commonly serve as quintessential 2D substrates and templates to develop hybrid structures with novel and/or enhanced properties and performance. However, the effects and control of their ubiquitous and abundant structural defects are still poorly explored and understood. Here, exploiting their highly reactive and defective edges, an unprecedented strategy is introduced for their toposelective functionalization with noble metal nanoparticles through galvanic displacement. Selectively edge&#8208;decorated transition metal dichalcogenides nanosheets are successfully produced with gold, palladium, or platinum nanoparticles, showing tunable loading and size. As proof of concept, the hybrid systems are tested for optical and photothermal sensing, as well as electrocatalysis and electronics, demonstrating their enhanced functionality and broad applicability. These findings pave the way for the versatile production of mixed&#8208;dimensional multifunctional materials, achieved by harnessing the defective nature of solution&#8208;processed transition metal dichalcogenides via molecular chemistry approaches.

         <title>Natural Cell&#8208;Inspired Nanoparticles: Preparation, Mechanisms, Applications, and Prospects for Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively examines nature cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs), which achieve molecular&#8208;level emulation of natural cells through precise reconstruction of membrane interfaces. It systematically catalogs diverse natural cell membrane sources, details advanced biofabrication strategies, and elucidates functional mechanisms and therapeutic potential across diverse biomedical applications. The review critically analyzes barriers to clinical translation and discusses potential regulatory solutions for NCINP technologies.








Abstract
Natural cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs) represent a transformative innovation in nanomedicine, featuring a core&#8211;shell structure coated with isolated natural cell membranes (NCMs) that effectively mimic the functions of native cells. The development of NCINPs achieves molecular&#8208;level emulation of native cells by precisely reconstructing the hierarchical architecture of the bio&#8208;interface, including the structure of the phospholipid bilayer, lipid rafts, protein matrix, and polysaccharide interactions. This advanced biomimetic strategy not only retains the inherent biocompatibility and targeting precision of natural cells but also enables programmable functionalities that surpass those of natural systems, offering enhanced therapeutic potential. In this review, an in&#8208;depth introduction to the background of natural cell&#8208;inspired research is provided, the current prevalent synthesis methods of NCINPs is delineated, and the application mechanisms based on various types of NCMs, as well as their applications in both benign and malignant diseases are elucidated. However, clinical translation faces significant challenges: complex synthesis, compromised membrane functionality, and unpredictable in vivo behavior. The work comprehensively synthesizes the progress, limitations, and challenges encountered throughout the development of NCINPs, while delineating future prospects. Bridging the translational gap from bench to bedside accelerates the clinical translation of NCINPs and fully realizes their therapeutic potential across diverse medical applications.

         <title>Machine Learning for Design and Full Chain Research of High&#8208;Entropy Na&#8208;Ion Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is designed to efficiently discover HEO compositions. The factors affecting structural stability, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions are further verified. In conclusion, this work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, and performance verification to pilot application.








Abstract
How to proficiently and accurately explore the vast compositional space of materials and accelerate the development of new materials with outstanding properties, especially structurally complex high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), remains a challenge in materials science. To address this, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is proposed, which combines ensemble learning, unsupervised learning, and Bayesian optimization, enabling efficient discovery of hidden patterns and comprehensive exploration of the component space. Based on the proposed HFML, a new HEO cathode material is screened out from over 2 million candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (Na0.95Li0.06Ni0.25Cu0.05Fe0.1Co0.05Mn0.44Ti0.05O2), which shows excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 83.6% after 1200 cycles) and high&#8208;rate performance (110 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and 96 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C). Key factors affecting structural stability are identified, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions, and are verified by electrochemical tests and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Additionally, pilot&#8208;scale production is achieved, and 2 Ah pouch cells based on this cathode demonstrate 95.0% capacity retention after 600 cycles. This work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, creation, and performance verification to pilot application (mass production and pouch sodium batteries).

         <title>Host Cell Membrane&#8208;Cloaked Nanomedicine Reprograms Endothelial Surface for Enhanced Patency in Allogeneic Vascular Grafts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a host red blood cell membrane&#8208;cloaked nanomedicine loaded with a TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling inhibitor for metabolically&#8208;guided cell surface reprogramming to enhance the patency of allogeneic vascular grafts via the synergistic combination of localized steric immune shielding and in situ therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
The endothelium serves as the first point of contact following the implantation of allogeneic vascular grafts (AGs) or organs. Rapid endothelial injury triggered by immunocytotoxicity, combined with subsequent endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling, collectively exacerbates complications, including thrombosis, inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia, ultimately leading to graft failure. In this study, a nanomedicine, R&#8208;SB@PLGA, is developed for use in metabolically guided cell surface reprogramming (CSR) in AGs. R&#8208;SB@PLGA is fabricated by encapsulating SB431542 (SB)&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles within host red blood cell membranes (RBCM). Upon immobilization, this nanomedicine reprograms the epitope presentation of endothelial cells (ECs), establishing localized steric immune shielding to preserve endothelial integrity without the need for systemic immunosuppression. Concurrently, the nanomedicine releases SB to inhibit the transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;)&#8208;mediated endothelial&#8208;to&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EndMT), thereby preventing endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling. In animal models of allogeneic carotid artery transplantation, R&#8208;SB@PLGA showed significant efficacy in enhancing graft patency by reducing vascular inflammation and intimal hyperplasia. By integrating site&#8208;specific immune shielding with in situ therapeutic delivery, a novel paradigm is established for improving transplant outcomes through localized intervention, which is highly promising for promoting the success of allogeneic vascular or organ transplantation.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the design and development of self&#8208;healing materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Furthermore, this review highlights cutting&#8208;edge applications of &#946;CD&#8208;based self&#8208;healing materials in sensors, 3D printing, tissue engineering, anti&#8208;corrosion coating, shape memory devices, and composites, demonstrating their adaptability to modern technological demands.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;healing (SH) materials have gained considerable attention for their ability to autonomously repair damage, thereby improving the longevity and performance of various systems. This review focuses on the design and development of SH materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Owing to their biocompatibility and excellent inclusion complexation capabilities, CDs&#8212;especially &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD)&#8212;play a key role in constructing HG&#8208;based SH systems. Recent progress in &#946;CD&#8208;based SH hydrogels for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering is discussed. In addition to healthcare, their application in smart coatings&#8212;including anti&#8208;fogging, fresh&#8208;keeping, and anti&#8208;corrosion layers&#8212;is reviewed. These materials are also integrated into sensors, demonstrating adaptability for real&#8208;time environmental and physiological monitoring. Emerging strategies involving 3D printing and shape memory functionalities further broaden their design potential. Despite these advances, challenges remain&#8212;particularly in scalability, environmental sensitivity, and achieving a balance between mechanical strength and healing efficiency. This review critically examines these limitations and highlights future directions, emphasizing the need for innovative fabrication approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration. By leveraging the unique properties of supramolecular interactions, &#946;CD&#8208;based SH materials offer promising solutions for a wide range of biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications.

         <title>Regular Tandem Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with over 51% External Quantum Efficiency for Next&#8208;Generation Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a regular tandem quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode achieving over 51% external quantum efficiency through systematic optimization of both charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Thanks to the fast response of this device, the obtained 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness.








Abstract
Despite excellent efficiency and stability achieved in regular single&#8208;unit quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), regular tandem QLEDs still suffer from limited device performance, lagging far behind the inverted tandem QLEDs. Here, novel regular tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with an ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) indium tin oxide (ITO) charge generation layer (CGL). Through systematic optimization of charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency, the resulting tandem QLEDs can exhibit a record&#8208;breaking EQE of 51.2%, an exceptional T95 lifetime of &#8776;31383 h (at 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and an ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8 V, which represent the highest performance metrics reported to date for regular tandem QLEDs. Thanks to the fast response of this tandem device (&#8776;4.8 &#181;s), the first&#8208;ever fabricated 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness, demonstrating that the achievable color display capability and driving scheme of QLED displays can be expanded by using the tandem architecture. It is believed the results will significantly promote the development of regular tandem QLEDs, which will lead to unprecedented improvements in device efficiency and stability, accelerating their application in next&#8208;generation displays and lighting.

         <title>Enhancing &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage Cleavage with Ultrahigh Faradaic Efficiency via Electrochemical&#8211;Chemical Tandem Catalysis for Lignin Valorization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic&#8211;chemical strategy enables efficient lignin oxidation under mild alkaline conditions. The Au/CuO&#8208;catalyzed process cleaves &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages via: i) electrochemical C&#945;&#9472;OH dehydrogenation and ii) spontaneous C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; scission. The tailored Au/CuO interface accelerates the critical dehydrogenation step, enhancing overall depolymerization efficiency.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages in lignin has gained prominence as a sustainable strategy for biomass valorization. However, its broader application remains limited by key challenges, such as low Faradaic efficiency (FE), high oxidation potentials, and limited mechanistic understanding. To address these limitations, an electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem catalysis system is developed for the electrooxidation of 2&#8208;phenoxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (PPE). Mechanistic investigations revealed a two&#8208;step tandem process in PPE cleavage: i) electrochemical dehydrogenation of the C&#945;&#9472;OH groups, followed by ii) non&#8208;electrochemical C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage. The improved cleavage efficiency can be primarily attributed to the accelerated electrocatalytic dehydrogenation step. To optimize the adsorption of OH&#8722; and PPE molecules during electrocatalysis, an Au&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated CuO nanoflakes (Au/CuO) electrocatalyst is designed. Comprehensive characterization techniques demonstrated that Au nanoparticles act as active sites for C&#945;&#9472;OH oxidation, while the CuO substrate facilitates PPE adsorption. Notably, the Au/CuO electrode achieved high product yields of 99.2% phenol and 80.2% benzoic acid at 0.95 VRHE, with a record&#8208;high FE of 74.7% for PPE conversion. Furthermore, the catalytic strategy was successfully extended to the depolymerization of organosolv lignin (OL). This study elucidates an electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem mechanism for the electrocatalytic cleavage of lignin and presents an efficient electrocatalyst with high FE for lignin depolymerization.

         <title>Diamond&#8208;Inspired DNA Hydrogel Based on Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids for Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral DNA nanostructure, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength. It exhibits multiple functionalities, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, hemostatic performance, etc. Single&#8208;cell sequencing indicates this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade, promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing.








Abstract
Burn wounds frequently pose high risks of a prolonged healing process and even death due to the persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated inflammatory cascade. There is an urgent requirement for advanced dressings modulating the immune microenvironment surrounding the wound. DNA hydrogels have been preliminarily investigated in tissue regeneration due to their excellent permeability, editability, and biocompatibility. However, their broader applications have been limited by poor mechanical properties, and their roles in tissue regeneration remain insufficiently explored. Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral framework DNA, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength due to its stable structure. Additionally, it exhibits multiple functionalities, including ROS scavenging, hemostatic performance, adhesion, injectability, shear&#8208;thinning behavior, and self&#8208;healing capability. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analysis indicates that this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade and promotes the transformation of pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages into an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This effect promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization with changes in the communication between macrophages, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing on the skin of mice. In summary, this study not only presents a novel approach to bolstering the mechanical strength of pure DNA hydrogels but also marks a systematic evaluation of DNA hydrogels in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Adaptive Metaskins for Active and Passive Thermal Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic integration of reconfigurable MXene micro&#8208;wrinkles and a temperature&#8208;sensitive substrate, an adaptive metaskin that can operate in either active or passive modes is proposed for multi&#8208;scenario IR camouflage. This coupling design enables reversible, continuous, controllable, and wide&#8208;range emissivity modulation, ensuring robust adaptability across diverse thermal environments, opening up an additional degree of freedom in IR camouflage applications.








Abstract
Dynamic thermal camouflage conceals objects from infrared detection by modulating surface emissivity to match the thermal signature of the background. However, existing emissivity modulation systems fail to perform effectively across both hot backgrounds, such as sun&#8208;heated buildings and roads, and cold backgrounds, such as open fields. Here, an adaptive metaskin capable of operating in either active (externally powered) or passive mode is demonstrated, enabling effective camouflage across diverse thermal environments. This is achieved through the synergistic integration of a plasmonic MXene metasurface and a reprogrammable liquid crystal elastomer. The metaskin offers both a wide, continuously tunable emissivity range (&#8776;41%) and a rapid temperature response (1.2 s), selectively triggered in the passive mode. In cold backgrounds (e.g., 20&#160;&#176;C), the system operates in an active mode, delivering a non&#8208;volatile low&#8208;emissivity state that conceals objects across a wide temperature range (e.g., 20&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C). In hot backgrounds (e.g., 50&#160;&#176;C), it switches to passive mode, autonomously modulating its emissivity and maintaining an average infrared contrast of just 4.7&#160;&#176;C for objects of 50&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C. This dual&#8208;mode design is expected to address the challenges of active and passive thermal camouflage, opening new possibilities for dynamic thermal radiation management.

     alt="Adaptive Metaskins for Active and Passive Thermal Camouflage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the synergistic integration of reconfigurable MXene micro-wrinkles and a temperature-sensitive substrate, an adaptive metaskin that can operate in either active or passive modes is proposed for multi-scenario IR camouflage. This coupling design enables reversible, continuous, controllable, and wide-range emissivity modulation, ensuring robust adaptability across diverse thermal environments, opening up an additional degree of freedom in IR camouflage applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic thermal camouflage conceals objects from infrared detection by modulating surface emissivity to match the thermal signature of the background. However, existing emissivity modulation systems fail to perform effectively across both hot backgrounds, such as sun-heated buildings and roads, and cold backgrounds, such as open fields. Here, an adaptive metaskin capable of operating in either active (externally powered) or passive mode is demonstrated, enabling effective camouflage across diverse thermal environments. This is achieved through the synergistic integration of a plasmonic MXene metasurface and a reprogrammable liquid crystal elastomer. The metaskin offers both a wide, continuously tunable emissivity range (&#8776;41%) and a rapid temperature response (1.2 s), selectively triggered in the passive mode. In cold backgrounds (e.g., 20&#160;&#176;C), the system operates in an active mode, delivering a non-volatile low-emissivity state that conceals objects across a wide temperature range (e.g., 20&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C). In hot backgrounds (e.g., 50&#160;&#176;C), it switches to passive mode, autonomously modulating its emissivity and maintaining an average infrared contrast of just 4.7&#160;&#176;C for objects of 50&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C. This dual-mode design is expected to address the challenges of active and passive thermal camouflage, opening new possibilities for dynamic thermal radiation management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Second&#8208;Order Synaptic Memory using Inherent Plasticity of Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted double bilayer graphene moir&#233; superlattices exhibit electronic hysteresis and tunable second&#8208;order nonlinearity, enabled by twist&#8208;angle disorder and inversion symmetry breaking. This synergy powers a second&#8208;order synaptic memory device, establishing strained moir&#233; carbon systems as a novel platform for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing, driven by symmetry&#8208;breaking physics in a single&#8208;element material.








Abstract
Achieving synaptic functionality electronically in a single&#8208;element quantum material is a fundamental challenge, as conventional methods rely on the introduction of extrinsic charge&#8208;traps or polar components. Here, it is demonstrated that twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG) moir&#233; superlattices&#8212;composed purely of carbon&#8212;exhibit electronic hysteresis and plasticity in presence of twist&#8208;angle disorder. Inversion symmetry breaking at the moir&#233; length scales also gives rise to second&#8208;order nonlinear electrical response via disorder&#8208;mediated extrinsic mechanisms. Such second&#8208;order nonlinearity is highly tunable in both sign and magnitude by varying carrier concentration and vertical displacement field. The coexistence of electronic plasticity and second&#8208;order nonlinearity is harnessed to realize a second&#8208;order synaptic memory device. These findings establish strained moir&#233; carbon systems as a powerful new platform for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing, demonstrating that complex electronic functionality can emerge purely from symmetry&#8208;breaking physics in a single&#8208;element material.

         <title>Double Heterostructures for Monolayer Materials with Record Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure leveraging type&#8208;I band alignment in a double&#8208;gate design, where carriers transport through a wide indirect&#8208;bandgap WSe2 multilayer and are confined in a narrow direct&#8208;bandgap MoTe2 monolayer for efficient emission. The device achieves record 1% external quantum efficiency among TMDC p&#8208;n junctions and 24&#8208;fold power efficiency that of single MoTe2 counterpart, enabling silicon&#8208;integrated light sources.








Abstract
2D semiconductor materials have shown great potential and advantages for a wide variety of optoelectronic devices, especially compact and integrated light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the lack of a type&#8208;I double&#8208;heterostructure has severely hindered the development of efficient LEDs and lasers based on 2D materials. In this article, a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure is proposed based on a single type&#8208;I heterostructure composed of multilayer WSe2 and monolayer MoTe2 with double back&#8208;gates. This design synergizes the high mobility of the multilayer and the direct bandgap of the monolayer: carrier injection and transport are facilitated in the WSe2 barrier layer, while they are transferred and confined in the MoTe2 well layer for efficient radiative recombination through type&#8208;I band alignment. Therefore, the double&#8208;heterostructure reaches an external quantum efficiency of 1% level, a new record for p&#8208;n junctions based on transition metal dichalcogenides. Additionally, the heterostructure device achieves a 40&#8208;fold enhancement of the maximum electroluminescent intensity and a 24&#8208;fold enhancement of power efficiency compared with the single monolayer MoTe2 counterpart at room temperature. This promising strategy can also be extended to other 2D&#8208;semiconductor LEDs and could bring 2D&#8208;materials devices into practical applications of micro&#8208;LED displays, electrically injected 2D&#8208;materials lasers, and silicon&#8208;based on&#8208;chip light sources.

         <title>Ternary Strategy and Molecular Electrostatics Collaboratively Optimize Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polymer Donor Organic Solar Cells: Over 20% Efficiency and High Scalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inefficient low&#8208;molecule&#8208;weight LWPM6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) using trimeric acceptor TYT&#8208;S are optimized, enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. LWPM6 flexible devices show excellent mechanical stability and solution&#8208;processability, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.








Abstract
Achieving consistent performance across polymer donor batches is crucial for the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs). Compared with high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (HWPM6), low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (LWPM6) has lower efficiency but better stress&#8208;dispersion characteristics and solution&#8208;processability, making its performance improvement vital for practical applications. Here, LWPM6&#8208;based OSCs are optimized by introducing a trimeric guest (TYT&#8208;S). TYT&#8208;S improves PM6:Y6 compatibility, achieving a finer phase separation and a favorable interpenetrating network morphology. A ternary strategy, leveraging molecular electrostatic potential differences, promotes LWPM6 pre&#8208;aggregation, extends film&#8208;formation time, and enhances molecular ordering. The LWPM6&#8208;based ternary system exhibits an optimized vertical phase distribution, with maximum exciton dissociation occurring near the cathode, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.23% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.35%). When BTP&#8208;eC9 replaces Y6, the LWPM6&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a PCE of 20.12% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.64%). Additionally, LW polymers can dissipate stress via segmental motion. After 3000 bending cycles, LWPM6&#8208;based flexible devices retain higher initial efficiency than HWPM6&#8208;based one, demonstrating better mechanical stability. In mini&#8208;modules, they also have good solution&#8208;processability. This work demonstrates that a trimer guest strategy can significantly enhance the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;efficiency LWPM6, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.

         <title>Fully Synthetic Hydrogels Promote Robust Crypt Formation in Intestinal Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is broad interest in studying murine intestinal organoids (mIOs) crypts because of their link to disease. Historically these organoids have required the supplementation of laminin into the matrices they are cultured in to differentiate. Herein, a fully synthetic, rapid stress relaxing hydrogel is presented that promotes differentiation with laminin supplementation, enabling greater study of organoid crypt formation.









Abstract
Initial landmark studies in the design of synthetic hydrogels for intestinal organoid culture identify precise matrix requirements for differentiation, namely decompression of matrix&#8208;imposed forces and supplementation of laminin. But beyond stating the necessity of laminin, organoid&#8208;laminin interactions have gone largely unstudied, as this ubiquitous requirement of exogenous laminin hinders investigation. In this work, a fast stress relaxing, boronate ester&#8208;based synthetic hydrogel is used for the culture of intestinal organoids, and it is fortuitously discovered that unlike all other synthetic hydrogels to date, laminin does not need to be supplemented for crypt formation. This highly defined material provides a unique opportunity to investigate laminin&#8208;organoid interactions and how it influences crypt evolution and organoid function. Via fluorescent labeling of non&#8208;canonical amino acids, it is further shown that adaptable boronate ester bonds increase deposition of nascent proteins, including laminin. Collectively, these results advance the understanding of how mechanical and matricellular signaling influence intestinal organoid development.

         <title>Flexible Photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia. This study introduces a fully implantable, wireless photovoltaic neurostimulator that integrates flexible self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 photovoltaic cells. This adaptive optoelectronic system enables near&#8208;infrared&#8208;triggered nerve electrical stimulation, showing significant pain reduction in neuropathic conditions.








Abstract
Chronic neuropathic pain remains a significant clinical challenge, often requiring prolonged opioid use and exposing patients to associated complications. Current nerve electrical stimulation (ES) techniques show promise for analgesia but are constrained by their invasive nature and the potential risk of iatrogenic nerve injury. In this study, a novel approach is introduced to managing chronic pain through the development of a fully implantable, wireless, and self&#8208;adaptive photovoltaic neurostimulator (PVNS). This innovative device combines flexible, self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, enabling near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered nerve ES. In vivo neuralgia models demonstrate significant analgesic effects, while mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of inflammatory pathway regulation and modulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). The PVNS eliminates the difficulty for tethered stimulation and reduces the risk of peripheral nerve injury, offering a groundbreaking and minimally invasive solution for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

         <title>Biovision&#8208;Inspired Perovskite Intelligent Camera for Panchromatic and Metameric Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biovision&#8208;inspired intelligent imaging system combines perovskite photodetectors, single&#8208;pixel imaging and deep learning&#8211;driven color fusion to emulate the best of mantis shrimp&#8208;like multispectral vision and human color perception. With multispectral channels in a compact filter&#8208;free setup, the system enables full&#8208;color imaging and metamerism resistance, portending a new paradigm in adaptive color vision technology.








Abstract
Biological vision systems excel at acquiring and processing information, but there is often a trade&#8208;off between these capabilities. For instance, mantis shrimp possess exceptional spectral sensing but poor color perception due to limited neural processing. Taking the best of both worlds, the mantis shrimp's spectral detection ability and the human&#8208;like visual processing power are integrated to achieve full&#8208;color perception. Using an aerosol&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid spraying technique, an array of high&#8208;quality, excess ion migration enhanced perovskite narrowband photodetectors spanning the ultraviolet to visible spectrum is developed. These detectors enable a computational multispectral imaging system that captures seven spectral images in one shot. A deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based color fusion network is designed to efficiently translate multispectral inputs into an RGB representation, significantly enhancing color recognition of these mantis shrimp&#8208;inspired multispectral cameras and affording the capability to overcome metamerism. These perovskite intelligent camera leverages the strengths of biological vision and demonstrate a novel approach to multispectral imaging that could advance applications in machine vision, remote sensing, and medical imaging.

         <title>Photosystem II&#8208;Carbon Nitride Photoanodes for Scalable Biophotoelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spray&#8208;freeze method is developed to fabricate large&#8208;area (up to 33 cm2) macroporous carbon nitride photoanodes integrated with photosystem II enzymes for biophotoelectrochemical systems. The photoanodes reach a Faradaic efficiency of 93.5% for O2 evolution. Bias&#8208;free tandem biophotovoltaic devices with a total photoactive area of 72 cm2 drive low&#8208;power electronics, highlighting the promise of PSII&#8208;based platforms for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
Photosystem II (PSII) is a vital photosynthetic enzyme with the potential for sustainable bioelectricity and fuel generation. However, interfacing PSII with intricate, small&#8208;scale electrodes for practical applications has been challenging. This study addresses this by creating protonated macroporous carbon nitride (MCN) as support and developing a scalable spray&#8208;freeze method to wire PSII with MCN. This facilitates the production of large&#8208;area MCN&#8208;PSII photoanodes up to 33 cm2 for biophotoelectrochemical water oxidation to O2, achieving efficient interfacial charge transfer and initial photocurrents in the mA range with Faradaic yield of 93.5&#160;&#177;&#160;8.5% over 5&#160;h. A bias&#8208;free biophotoelectrochemical (BPEC) device is designed by connecting the MCN&#8208;PSII photoanode to a carbon nanotube cathode loaded with bilirubin oxidase. An array of eight tandem BPEC cells with a photoactive area of 72 cm2 successfully powers low&#8208;power electronics, such as LEDs. This work paves an efficient way for bioelectrode fabrication, showcasing the potential of PSII&#8208;based semi&#8208;artificial systems for BPEC and biophotovoltaic applications.

         <title>Separator Engineering for Sodium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Rational Design and Recent Modification Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers advances in sodium metal battery separators, focusing on interfacial stabilization, dendrite suppression, and ion transport. It analyzes diverse materials, proposes comprehensive evaluation methods, and discusses simulations and future directions for high&#8208;performance, safe, and practical separators.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, leveraging their high theoretical capacity and the natural abundance of Na resources. Nevertheless, critical challenges, including dendritic growth, side reactions, and pronounced volume fluctuations during cycling, continue to impede their commercialization. Conventional separators, including polyolefin or glass fiber types, suffer from poor wettability, uneven ion flux, and a rough surface. To tackle these challenges, functional separator engineering encompassing interfacial chemistry regulation, multiscale structural design, and hybrid integration of advanced materials has demonstrated remarkable progress in regulating Na&#8314; flux, stabilizing SEI, and suppressing dendrite propagation. This review systematically provides a comprehensive summary of recent developments in separator engineering for SMBs, including modified polyolefin separators, enhanced glass fiber frameworks, cellulose&#8208;based separators, MOFs/COFs&#8208;based, and emerging separators. In addition, a comprehensive electrochemical evaluation framework encompassing CE in half&#8208;cells is proposed, the lifespan of symmetric cells, full cell performance, and safety validation to assess practical applicability. Furthermore, computational simulations for mechanism elucidation and predictive design, as well as future separator perspectives, have been also discussed to guide the development of next&#8208;generation separators for high&#8208;performance and commercially viable SMBs.

         <title>Reducing Structural Distortion by Tailoring Orbital Interactions in High&#8208;Voltage Polyanionic Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main structural distortion of the KVPO4F cathode is attributed to the V5+ octahedral distortion. Low energy&#8208;level Mn is introduced into V site to enhance the matching of the central transition metal ion's 3d orbitals with the ligands&#8217; 2p orbitals in &#963; and &#960; symmetry. The strong orbital interactions suppress octahedron distortion and structure degradation to endure steady&#160;ion extraction.








Abstract
The structural distortion of electrode materials in battery systems usually results in the structure degradation and capacity fading upon cycling. However, the fundamental mechanism about the structural distortion remains elusive. A critical issue has emerged concerning the utilization of high&#8208;voltage potassium vanadium fluorophosphate compound (KVPO4F) as a competitive cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion battery applications. In this work, it is initially identified that the primary distortion in KVPO4F cathode is octahedra distortion. The weak orbital interactions among central transition metal ions with ligands in an octahedron play a pivotal role in the structural distortion, resulting in an accumulation of microstrain during the cycles. This cognition serves as the foundation for the introduction of low energy&#8208;level Mn into the V sites to suppress the structure distortion and lattice microstrain. The multi&#8208;electron 3d orbitals of Mn sites tend to interact with the &#963; and &#960; symmetry&#8208;matched 2p orbitals of ligands, thereby facilitating the formation of stable octahedrons to endure ion extraction steadily in high voltage. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of structure degradation based on the octahedral distortion, thereby facilitating the enhancement of stability in high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

         <title>Genetic Surfaceome E. coli Reprogramming Enables Selective Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic material based on bilirubin oxidase (BOD) surface&#8208;expressed on E. coli for effective electrocatalysis is reported. With this material, highly efficient and selective water oxidation is achieved, a critical half reaction for synthetic photosynthesis.








Abstract
Programming catalytic behavior at the microbial genome level is a frontier in synthetic biology with direct impact on bioelectrocatalysis. A key challenge is the coordinated control of gene expression, localization, folding, and cofactor maturation required to achieve proper bioelectrocatalytic activity. Here, a synthetic operon in Escherichia coli is engineered to reprogram its surfaceome for selective water oxidation. Using orthogonal IPTG&#8208;inducible control and codon&#8208;optimized expression, a fungal bilirubin oxidase (BOD) displayed at the cell surface is produced by ice nucleation protein anchoring (BOD&#8208;E. coli). Post&#8208;overexpression copper catalytic site reconstitution provides an active holoenzyme. The developed engineered living material performs water oxidation at near&#8208;zero overpotential (27&#160;mV at pH 9.1), with complete suppression of the oxygen reduction reaction. These results show how regenerable microbial platforms can be designed for selective catalysis and artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Fluorinated Pseudo&#8208;Halide Anion Enables &gt;19% Efficiency and Durable Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudo&#8208;halide, short&#8208;chain, and hydrophobicity anion PF6&#8722; is introduced to form a ligand shell of FAPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) to overcome surface defect density, inter&#8208;dot transport, and instability challenges, output a record&#8208;high efficiency of over 19% and improve long&#8208;term stability in PQD solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), like formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3), hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. Surface manipulation of PQDs has been extensively reported to be crucial to their photovoltaic performance due to the dynamic binding of capping long&#8208;chain ligands. In this work, an efficient surface engineering strategy employing a multifunctional fluorinated pseudo&#8208;halide anion ligand, hexafluorophosphate (PF6&#8722;) is reported for achieving efficient FAPbI3 PQD solar cells. Leveraging its coordination capability, large ionic radius (2.38 &#197;), and intrinsic hydrophobicity, PF6&#8722; simultaneously passivates iodide vacancies, minimizes inter&#8208;dot spacing for enhanced electronic coupling, suppresses ion migration, and provides a hydrophobic barrier. By replacing oleate ligands with PF6&#8722; in FAPbI3 PQDs, an unprecedented high efficiency of 19.01% (17.19% for a 1 cm2&#8208;sized device) is achieved, and enhanced storage and operational stability. These findings will provide insight into the design of robust surface structures and low&#8208;trap&#8208;states PQD films toward high&#8208;efficiency and stable solar cells.

         <title>Programmable Active Phase Reconstruction in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward High&#8208;Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study harnesses multimetallic synergy to program dynamic evolution of 2D nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks to architect high&#8208;activity oxyhydroxides phase for oxygen evolution. The cascade control of reconstruction dynamics, terminated structure state, and catalytic pathways deciphers &#8220;reconstruction&#8208;catalysis&#8221; programming principles. This paradigm shift enables on&#8208;demand design of efficient electrocatalysts through proactive reconstruction steering.








Abstract
Orchestrated manipulation of the dynamic structural evolution of catalytic materials in service represents an effective approach to rationally architect the active phase for highly efficient catalysis. Herein, this study reports a 2D ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) pre&#8208;catalyst, where multimetallic electronic cooperativity enables on&#8208;demand hierarchical regulation of the structural evolution as well as the catalytic process of the reconstruction&#8208;derived active phase, delivering oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance superior to benchmark RuO2. Tailored cobalt&#8208;iron co&#8208;substitution in nickel&#8208;based MOF strategically engineers the overall structural flexibility, controllably promoting the reconstruction process in alkaline media into ligand&#8208;anchored nickel oxyhydroxide active phases. Crucially, the controlled modulation of the structural state of reconstructed phases induces targeted metal&#8208;oxygen electronic interplay, steering active oxygen intermediate reconfiguration and reducing the thermodynamic bottleneck of the rate&#8208;determining step, ultimately achieving optimized catalytic pathways. This work precisely constructs MOF&#8208;derived reconstructed active phases and elucidates a programmed optimization mechanism governed by multimetallic electronic interplay, which dynamically bridges structural transformation and catalytic activity enhancement. A promising approach is showcased to accurately design high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts through programming dynamic structural evolution.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Single&#8208;Atom Evaporator: Collaborative Omnibearing Light Trapping Stereo Structures for Efficient Water Transport Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D conical cone array evaporators is prepared based on high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom composite thermal management materials which only contain 3 wt.%. This design achieves a water evaporation rate of 2.86 kg&#160;m&#8722;2 along with an evaporation efficiency of 94.5% under 1.0 sunlight irradiation. The absorbed energy of cone array evaporators improved 18% and the evaporation rate is increased by 58.7% compared to the flat structure evaporator, offering significant insights for the progression of solar interface evaporation technology.








Abstract
Achieving efficient photothermal evaporation requires a synergistic integration of thermal management, water transport dynamics, and light trapping&#8212;key elements often challenging to harmonize. Herein, A high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atomic metal doped porous carbon (HESA) with ultra&#8208;low metal content of 1.77 wt.% is designed as a new type of photothermal material through a green and convenient routine, which displays tunable hierarchical nano/micro/macro&#8208;porous structure. By integrating molecular dynamics simulations with a 3D light capture structure, a HESA cone evaporator is prepared, utilizing only 3 wt.% of photothermal content. Under 1.0 sun illumination, the cone evaporator demonstrates an outstanding water evaporation rate of 2.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and photothermal evaporation efficiency of 94.5%. Compared to conventional flat evaporators, the cone increases absorbed energy by 18% and enhances the evaporation rate by 58.7%. Molecular dynamics analyses reveal that the evaporator significantly improves water transfer kinetics, achieving an intermediate water content nearly twice that of pure water. Complementary COMSOL simulations further validate that the conical array structure enhances light absorption and optimizes water evaporation and diffusion. This meticulously designed evaporator leverages adaptive thermal and light management strategies, offering an effective solution to longstanding challenges in solar interfacial evaporation.

         <title>Steep&#8208;Slope CuInP2S6 Ferroionic Threshold Switching Field&#8208;Effect Transistor for Implementation of Artificial Spiking Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired spiking neuron device based on a CuInP2S6 (CIPS) ferroionic threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor TS&#8208;FET is reported. The device demonstrates essential neuronal behaviors, such as leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire dynamics, a tunable firing threshold, and spatiotemporal processing, all without requiring auxiliary reset circuitry. Furthermore, a spiking neural network (SNN) is implemented by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices.








Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention as energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired computing paradigms. However, despite the growing interest, the development of hardware&#8208;based SNNs has remained limited, primarily because of insufficient research on hardware&#8208;based spiking neuron devices. In this study, a CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor (TS&#8208;FET) is presented, featuring steep switching characteristics, and demonstrate its potential as an energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device. The proposed device exhibits outstanding characteristics: ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS &#8776;7.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off current ratio (&gt;107), and ultra&#8208;low off current (&#8776;0.3 pA) due to the ferroionic properties of CIPS. The tunable dynamics for Cu+ ion migration induce a phase transition, leading to sharp resistance switching and efficient spiking. This device successfully mimics key neuronal dynamics, including leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire, threshold tuning, and spatiotemporal dynamics, without requiring auxiliary reset circuits. Furthermore, SNN is constructed by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices and evaluate face classification performance using an unsupervised learning approach, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.83% via the lateral inhibition function of the neuron device. The findings highlight the potential of CIPS TS&#8208;FET as energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device applications for next&#8208;generation SNN&#8208;based neuromorphic computing systems.

The tunable dynamics for Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion migration induce a phase transition, leading to sharp resistance switching and efficient spiking. This device successfully mimics key neuronal dynamics, including leaky integrate-and-fire, threshold tuning, and spatiotemporal dynamics, without requiring auxiliary reset circuits. Furthermore, SNN is constructed by integrating CIPS-based synaptic and neuron devices and evaluate face classification performance using an unsupervised learning approach, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.83% via the lateral inhibition function of the neuron device. The findings highlight the potential of CIPS TS-FET as energy-efficient spiking neuron device applications for next-generation SNN-based neuromorphic computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Essence of Lignin: High&#8208;Performance Adhesives That Bond via Thiol&#8208;Catechol Connectivities and Debond on Electrochemical Command</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lignin&#8208;inspired adhesive is presented, that combines the bonding strength of a structural adhesive with on&#8208;demand electrochemical debonding, enabled by biomimetic thiol&#8208;catechol connectivities. Voltage application of only 9 V facilitates electrochemical oxidation of catechols to quinones leading to guided detachment on command. This adhesive significantly improves repair and recycling strategies of e.g. microelectronic devices, which is demonstrated on a display prototype.








Abstract
The next generation of adhesives requires effective debonding capabilities that can be triggered on demand to enable advanced circular repair and recycling strategies. A new class of lignin&#8208;inspired, two&#8208;component (2K) structural adhesives offers bonding strengths of up to 20&#160;MPa and clean, on&#8208;command electrochemical debonding within 5&#8211;30 min. The debonding is induced by a distinct electrochemical oxidation of thiol&#8208;catechol connectivities (TCCs) within the entire adhesive network, enforcing rapid and clean adhesive failure on the cathodic substrate side. The TCC&#8208;functionalities are formed during curing by a thiol&#8208;quinone Michael&#8208;type polyaddition, reacting polyester&#8208;based trithiols with tris&#8208;quinones as lignin&#8208;inspired minimal building blocks. The structural adhesive can be fine&#8208;tuned by adjusting the formulation. The addition of carbon black and ionic liquids facilitates the desired electrochemical transformation of TCC&#8208;catechols to TCC&#8208;quinones. Applying only 9&#160;V for 5&#8211;30&#160;min, leads to clean debonding with 72&#8211;86% loss of shear strength. A comprehensive study of curing, bonding, and debonding behavior by rheological, spectroscopic, and electrochemical investigations reveals the debonding mechanism by correlating catechol oxidation to adhesive performance. The electrochemical debonding capability of TCC&#8208;structural adhesives is demonstrated in a functional prototype, where on&#8208;command detachment of a cover glass from a display device is achieved within 6.5 min.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Omnidirectional Wind Domain Energy Harvesting Based on Dual&#8208;Mode Complementary Strategy of Wind&#8208;Induced Vibration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration realizes broadband breeze vibration energy harvesting and optimizes wind energy collection in a wide range of wind speed and direction, filling the gap in energy collection when the transmission line does not vibrate due to wind direction changes.








Abstract
The harvesting and utilization of vibration energy from transmission lines can effectively advance the development of smart grids. However, variations in wind direction significantly affect the vibration status of transmission lines&#8208;a problem often overlooked in research. This paper clarifies the gap problem of wind&#8208;induced vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines for the first time, and presents a dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration for transmission lines. The core innovation is to achieve self&#8208;adaptive omnidirectional wind domain energy harvesting by wind&#8208;vibration energy collaborative response, which overcomes the limitation of single vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines that depend on a specific wind direction. The designed wind&#8208;vibration hybrid nanogenerator (W&#8208;VHNG) ingeniously integrates two different TENG mechanisms to achieve broadband breeze vibration energy capture (vibration frequency range of 5&#8211;60&#160;Hz), wide wind speed and direction adaptability (wind speed range of 4.2&#8211;14 m&#160;s&#8722;1 and the wind direction range of &#177;30&#176;), and mW&#8208;scale power output (maximum mean power of 1.33&#160;mW). Finally, the potential of the W&#8208;VHNG for self&#8208;powered sensing of transmission lines is highlighted through three application strategies. This research provides a new solution for the sustainable harvesting of complex and variable high&#8208;entropy energy in transmission lines.

         <title>A Multimodal Sensory Textile Using Programmable Ferroelectric Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional wearable sensors struggle with power efficiency and integration for multimodal sensing. This work presents a wearable sensory textile using programmable ferroelectric nanocomposites that can simultaneously detect mechanical and thermal stimuli. It opens new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance materials and self&#8208;powered multimodal sensors for human&#8211;machine interfaces and virtual reality applications.








Abstract
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, multimodal sensing is becoming increasingly important. However, conventional approaches relying on multiple integrated sensors face significant challenges due to power consumption and miniaturization requirements. In response, a wearable multimodal sensory textile (MST) for simultaneous mechanical and thermal sensing is developed. The MST demonstrates exceptional capabilities for concurrent mechanical and thermal tactile sensing, with a pressure sensitivity of 0.9 V N&#8722;1 and temperature sensitivity of 38.7 pA K&#8722;1. This outstanding sensing performance is attributed to the mechanical and thermal reinforcement of the programmable ferroelectric nanocomposite enabled by topological engineering. By combining phase&#8208;field simulation with experimental characterization, it is revealed that the alignment of ceramic fillers not only promotes spontaneous polarization and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane domain fraction under external poling but also establishes bimodal pathways for efficient stress and heat transmission. The programmable arrangement and orientation of ferroelectric oxide fillers, achieved by tuning dielectrophoretic voltage, frequency, and temperature, boost piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses by 114% and 131%, respectively, compared to randomly distributed counterparts. This work offers insights into the underlying mechanism of topological modulation in polymer composites and provides new possibilities for designing high&#8208;performance functional materials for multimodal sensing, as well as self&#8208;powered multimodal sensors for human&#8211;machine interfaces and virtual reality.

Single&#8208;Injection Self&#8208;Boosting Vaccines
A single&#8208;injection platform for self&#8208;boosting vaccines is developed using a polyanhydride&#8208;based delivery system. The platform enables pulsatile antigen release, protects pH&#8208;sensitive cargo, and elicits immune responses comparable to traditional multi&#8208;dose regimens. Machine learning enhances design by accurately predicting release profiles, offering a promising solution to improve global vaccine coverage and reduce under&#8208;immunization. More details can be found in article number 2501168 by Robert Langer, Ana Jaklenec, and co&#8208;workers.

Fracture Healing
In a micromotion mechanical environment, the &#8220;mechanical&#8208;electrical&#8208;pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, triggering stress&#8208;responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation by promoting macrophage polarization from the M1 to M2 phenotype while enhancing osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway to reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. More details can be found in article number 2505061 by Xiaochen Zhang, Shuogui Xu, Hao Zhang, and co&#8208;workers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fracture Healing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a micromotion mechanical environment, the &#8220;mechanical-electrical-pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, triggering stress-responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation by promoting macrophage polarization from the M1 to M2 phenotype while enhancing osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF-&#954;B pathway to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the topological structures in biological piezoelectric materials, covering morphology evolution, spatial arrangement, and biomimetic strategies. These topologies modulate structure&#8208;property relationships across multiple scales, enabling performance enhancement and multifunctional integration. Insights into topology&#8208;guided optimization and growing applications in biosensing, health monitoring, energy harvesting, and disease treatment are provided, along with challenges for future research directions.








Abstract
Topology is fundamental in determining the properties and functions of biological piezoelectric materials by influencing service performances across multiple scales, from nanoscale molecular arrangements to macroscopic assembly structures. At each scale, topology governs electrical, mechanical, and biological behaviors, facilitating multifunctional integration and multi&#8208;field coupling advances. Recent progress demonstrates the potential of topological optimization to enhance piezoelectric coefficients and enable complex functionalities. Strategies such as multi&#8208;scale design, machine learning&#8208;guided optimization, and precision fabrication techniques are being explored to address persistent challenges, including limited energy conversion efficiency, long&#8208;term stability, and biocompatibility. Critical applications include health monitoring, biosensing, energy harvesting, and disease treatment, highlighting opportunities and unresolved technical bottlenecks. Future research directions are discussed to present theoretical insights and practical pathways to the development of biological piezoelectric materials.

         <title>Smart Self&#8208;Healing Anode/Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, many researchers have attempted to develop ESAEIs or ISAEIs for stabilizing the Zn anode. ESAEIs can be divided into static ESAEIs and dynamic ESAEIs according to the evolution of ESAEIs during the cycling process, while ISAEIs include polymer&#8208;based ISAEIs and liquid metal&#8208;based ISAEIs according to the chemical composition.








Abstract
The rational design of Zn anode/electrolyte interphases (AEIs) is an effective strategy for regulating the Zn2+ stripping/plating process, as well as suppressing the interfacial side reactions. However, the formation of defects during the cycling process is still inevitable, and the exacerbation of defects would lead to the failure of the electrode, limiting the long&#8208;term stability of the Zn anode. In recent years, self&#8208;healing AEIs (SAEIs) have received great attention in Zn anode modification, as they can self&#8208;heal and suppress the defects. This review summarizes the latest progress of SAEIs for Zn anode, including extrinsic and intrinsic SAEIs. Specifically, the design strategies and self&#8208;healing mechanisms of SAEIs, their roles in stabilizing Zn anode, as well as the research methods for self&#8208;healing performance, are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges for the research of SAEIs are also analyzed, and prospects for the future design and research of SAEIs for Zn anode are provided. This review is expected to guide the future development of high&#8208;performance SAEIs for Zn and other metal anodes.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrogen Production Coupling with the Upgrading of Organic and Inorganic Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the coupling of electrocatalytic H&#8322; production with the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals. The optimization synthesis strategy, catalytic activity, and structure&#8211;performance relationships of various electrocatalysts are summarized, and relevant catalytic reaction mechanisms and electrolytic cell configuration in practical application scenarios are discussed.

Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a green and sustainable method for producing high&#8208;purity H2. However, in conventional water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a four&#8208;electron transfer process with inherently sluggish kinetics, which severely limits the overall efficiency of water splitting. Recently, replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction, has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable progress. This strategy not only offers a promising route for energy&#8208;saving H&#8322; production but also enables the simultaneous synthesis of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products or the removal of pollutants at the anode. Researchers successfully demonstrate the upgrading of numerous organic and inorganic alternatives through this approach. In this review, the latest advances in the coupling of electrocatalytic H2 production and the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals are summarized. What's more, the optimization strategy of catalysts, structure&#8211;performance relationship, and catalytic mechanism of various reactions are well discussed in each part. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are outlined, aiming to inspire further innovative breakthroughs in this exciting area of research.

         <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Structural Regulation Methods and Quantum Chemistry for Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Advanced Oxidation Process: Critical Perspectives into Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide comprehensive molecular&#8208;level insights regarding catalytic oxidation mechanisms by carbon&#8208;based SACs, especially the coupling of the &#8220;oxidants&#8208;catalysts&#8208;pollutants&#8221; internal molecular&#8208;level relationships. It is worth clarifying that all the molecular&#8208;level insights eventually are served for the development of scale&#8208;up engineering, which will satisfy the demand for actual wastewater.








Abstract
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are recognized as an attractive scientific frontier for water treatment, with the outstanding benefits of ultra&#8208;effective and anti&#8208;interference capability. However, most of the research has paid more attention to the performance of SACs, while the in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic regulation by molecular interaction is relatively deficient. This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro&#8208;level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular&#8208;oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored.

     alt="State-Of-The-Art Structural Regulation Methods and Quantum Chemistry for Carbon-Based Single-Atom Catalysts in Advanced Oxidation Process: Critical Perspectives into Molecular Level"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review aims to provide comprehensive molecular-level insights regarding catalytic oxidation mechanisms by carbon-based SACs, especially the coupling of the &#8220;oxidants-catalysts-pollutants&#8221; internal molecular-level relationships. It is worth clarifying that all the molecular-level insights eventually are served for the development of scale-up engineering, which will satisfy the demand for actual wastewater.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) are recognized as an attractive scientific frontier for water treatment, with the outstanding benefits of ultra-effective and anti-interference capability. However, most of the research has paid more attention to the performance of SACs, while the in-depth understanding of catalytic regulation by molecular interaction is relatively deficient. This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro-level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular-oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored. Following the oxidants, state-of-the-art regulation methods are discussed with special attention to involved molecular interactions and pollutants. Particularly, the preliminary insights into the &#8220;oxidant-catalyst-pollutants&#8221; internal relationships are provided to help construct the SAC-AOP system from a molecular standpoint. Meanwhile, some cutting-edge laboratory devices and pilot-scale engineering are presented to illustrate the ultimate purpose of scientific molecular exploration. Eventually, relative challenges of SACs-AOPs upon the design of catalytic systems and investigation methods are provided. This review aims to promote the large-scale potential of SACs-based AOPs in practical water treatment by emphasizing the pivotal role of micro-insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Empowering Generalist Material Intelligence with Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines how large language models drive the emergence of generalist materials intelligence by orchestrating data mining, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and autonomous experimentation. Through the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, LLMs actively unify materials ontology, simulation, synthesis, and characterization, enabling closed&#8208;loop, multimodal reasoning across the entire materials discovery cycle.








Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) are steering the development of generalist materials intelligence (GMI), a unified framework integrating conceptual reasoning, computational modeling, and experimental validation. Central to this framework is the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, where LLM&#8208;based agents function as dynamic orchestrators, synthesizing multimodal knowledge, specialized models, and experimental robotics to enable fully autonomous discovery. Drawing from a comprehensive review of LLMs&#8217; transformative impact across representative applications in materials science, including data extraction, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and self&#8208;driven labs, this study underscores how LLMs are revolutionizing traditional tasks, catalyzing the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, and bridging the ontology&#8208;concept&#8208;computation&#8208;experiment continuum. Then the unique challenges of scaling up LLM adoption are discussed, particularly those arising from the misalignment of foundation LLMs with materials&#8208;specific knowledge, emphasizing the need to enhance adaptability, efficiency, sustainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in the pursuit of GMI. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that LLMs are not universally efficient. Their substantial resource demands and inconsistent performance call for careful deployment based on demonstrated task suitability. To address these realities, actionable strategies and a progressive roadmap for equitably and democratically implementing materials&#8208;aware LLMs in real&#8208;world practices are proposed.

         <title>Rational Design of Semiconducting Oligomer for Third Harmonic Generation Bioimaging of Ultradeep Brain Imaging with NIR&#8208;IIb Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With de novo design, semiconducting oligomers and their nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unexpectedly efficient Third harmonic generation (THG) performances with NIR&#8208;IIb excitation and anti&#8208;photobleaching capability. With these advantages, semiconducting oligomer NPs achieve high&#8208;resolution in vivo THG angiography of the deep brain at a record&#8208;high depth of 1745 &#181;m with spatial resolution and good biocompatibility, thus opening new horizons for developing high&#8208;performance THG probes.








Abstract
Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has unparalleled promise in high&#8208;spatiotemporal bioimaging within the tissue&#8208;transparent window of 1500 to 1700&#160;nm, commonly referred to as the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) region. However, so far, surprisingly few cases of non&#8208;fluorescent MPM probes have been&#160;reported, and their imaging performances are relatively limited. Herein, this study introduces a highly efficient third harmonic generation (THG) probe based on semiconducting oligomer derivatives (BTICs), which exhibit strong THG responses under NIR&#8208;IIb (1700&#160;nm) excitation. Leveraging halogen chemistry, semiconducting oligomers with varying halogen substitutions and nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;exhibit unexpectedly high THG performance across different aggregation states upon NIR&#8208;IIb excitation. The BTICs NPs exhibit a large THG conversion efficiency (1215&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;84 cm6 s2 photon&#8722;2) and exceptional resistance to photobleaching. Furthermore, the biocompatibility and in vivo THG angiography capabilities of BTICs NPs are validated, achieving the visualisation of deep&#8208;brain vasculature with unprecedented spatial resolution at a record&#8208;high imaging depth of 1745&#160;&#181;m. The pioneering exploitation of semiconducting oligomer&#8208;based THG probes establishes a new class of high&#8208;performance materials, enabling ultra&#8208;deep THG imaging of the&#160;brain and advancing the design of next&#8208;generation THG imaging platforms.

         <title>A Highly Adaptable Hydrogen Bond Re&#8208;Orientation (HyBRO) Strategy for Multiscale Vasculature Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy enables three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of vascular microchannel networks with high accuracy. By switching sacrificial material interactions with nonsolvents, HyBRO prevents swelling and deformation, enabling accurate hierarchical channels spanning a tenfold size range. The method accommodates diverse ink materials and produces vasculature exhibiting robust endothelial barrier function and ion&#8208;channel responses under shear stress.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional&#160;printing of microchannel networks mimicking native vasculature provides essential functions for biomedical applications. However, developing a highly &#8220;adaptable&#8221; technique &#8211; that can adjust to diverse materials choices, high shape accuracy, and broad size ranges &#8211; for producing physiologically responsive vasculature remains challenging. Here, an innovative hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy for microchannel network fabrication is reported. By identifying interfacial instability of sacrificial material (SM) during embedding as a core limitation, this strategy prints the SM into an optimal &#8220;nonsolvent&#8221; to shape the desirable channel structure. In this process, the nonsolvent instantaneously switches the SM from forming hydrogen bonds with exterior water to forming interior linkages inside it. This transition protects the SM from external solvent &#8220;erosion&#8221; upon re&#8208;exposure to embedding material, inhibiting deformation. Consequently, this approach enables the creation of accurate (&gt;90%), multiscale (10&#8208;fold), hierarchical microchannel networks, accommodating accurate printing of a wide range of ink materials &#8211; extending from typical hydrophilic polymers into non&#8208;typical hydrophobic ones. Further biological tests demonstrate that HyBRO&#8208;produced vasculature recapitulates not only essential endothelial barrier function but also delicate ion&#8208;channel responses to varying shear stresses, highlighting its potential for engineering physiologically responsive vasculature in broad applications.

         <title>Exceptional Thermal Conductivity in Printed Dielectrics through Compositional and Microstructural Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;generational compositional design creates a printable low&#8208;loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post&#8208;processing, which promotes templated crystallization in a polymer matrix from surface&#8208;modified particles, creating a &#8220;hetero&#8208;percolated network.&#8221; The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals.








Abstract
As electronic devices become simultaneously more powerful and compact, thermal management is increasingly critical. Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon&#8208;conducting ceramics offer a low&#8208;density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi&#8208;generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low&#8208;loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post&#8208;processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly&#8208;lactic acid &#160;matrix from surface&#8208;modified boron nitride platelets, creating a &#8220;hetero&#8208;percolated network&#8221;. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As electronic devices become simultaneously more powerful and compact, thermal management is increasingly critical. Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon-conducting ceramics offer a low-density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi-generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low-loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post-processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly-lactic acid &#160;matrix from surface-modified boron nitride platelets, creating a &#8220;hetero-percolated network&#8221;. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Adhesion of Monolayer Amorphous Carbon to Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adhesion energy of monolayer amorphous carbon on copper substrate is 85&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, 13 times higher than that of graphene due to covalent&#8208;like bonding between the sp2 carbon structure to copper. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption (NEXAFS), and (density functional theory) DFT calculations are used to elucidate the structural and electronic interactions at the monolayer amorphous carbon&#8208;copper interface.









Abstract
The single&#8208;atom thickness of graphene holds great potential for device scaling, but its effectiveness as a thin metal&#8208;ion diffusion barrier in microelectronics and a corrosion barrier for plasmonic devices is compromised by weak van der Waals interactions with copper (Cu), leading to delamination issues. In contrast, monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC), a recently reported single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick carbon film with a disordered sp2 hybridized structure, demonstrates superior adhesion properties. This study reveals that MAC exhibits an adhesion energy of 85&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 on Cu, which is 13 times greater than that of graphene. This exceptional adhesion is attributed to the formation of covalent&#8208;like Cu&#9472;C bonds while preserving its sp2 structure, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate that the corrugated structure of MAC facilitates the hybridization of C 2pz orbitals with Cu 4s and 3dz2 orbitals, promoting strong bonding. These insights indicate that the amorphous structure of MAC significantly enhances adhesion while preserving its elemental composition, providing a pathway to improve the mechanical reliability and performance of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials on metal substrates in various technological applications.

         <title>Ligand Field&#8208;Induced Dual Active Sites Enhance Redox Potential of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate for Ammonium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work aims to explore the electrochemical performance and energy storage mechanism of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) in ammonium ion batteries (AIBs). The effect of ligand field&#8208;induced dual active sites has been revealed for the first time. Ni atoms of NiHCF display electrochemical activity in AIBs. Additionally, Ni can balance the charge distribution and further enhance the redox potential.








Abstract
Enhancing the redox potential of cathode materials is vital for increasing the energy density of aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs). Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), with their inherently high redox potentials and open frameworks, are promising candidates. However, further boosting their redox potential and understanding their NH4+ ion storage mechanisms remain critical challenges. In this work, a novel ligand field&#8208;induced dual active sites mechanism is introduced by incorporating Ni into the PBA framework, activating Ni as an additional redox center for NH4+ ion storage. The electron transfer from Ni to Fe within the Ni&#9472;N&#8801;C&#9472;Fe chain enhances the redox potential and electrochemical performance of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF). For the first time, the electrochemical activity of Ni is demonstrated in NiHCF during NH4+ ions intercalation and de&#8208;intercalation. NiHCF exhibits elevated redox potentials, superior rate performance, and robust cycling stability compared to iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF). Advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations confirm the activation of Ni and the enhanced interaction between NH4+ ions and the framework. These findings provide new insights into the NH4+ ion storage mechanism of PBAs and offer a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for AIBs.

         <title>Inorganic Biomaterials Inducing Scaffolds Pre&#8208;Neuralization for Infarcted Myocardium Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a &#8220;pre&#8208;neuralized&#8221; scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that facilitates myocardial repair and improves cardiac function in vivo by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural&#8208;induced regulation in tissue repair.








Abstract
Neural networks are found to play an important role in monitoring and coordinating cardiac physiological activities. However, the clinical use of neuroregulatory strategies for repairing infarcted myocardium, such as vagus nerve stimulation and pharmacological activation, confronts the challenges of managing stimulation signals and potential drug side effects. In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a &#8220;pre&#8208;neuralized&#8221; scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. Strontium silicate promotes NSCs&#160;differentiation, resulting in a scaffold enriched with mature neurons. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that enhance the maturation and synchronized contraction of cardiomyocytes, facilitating myocardial repair and improving cardiac function in vivo. The findings indicate that the pre&#8208;neuralized scaffold aids myocardial recovery by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural&#8208;induced regulation in tissue repair. In conclusion, this study presents a promising approach to repairing infarcted myocardium using inorganic biomaterial&#8208;induced scaffolds with neuromodulatory properties from the perspective of systemically physiological regulation. This work may offer a new perspective for addressing complex tissue and organ injuries.

         <title>Noninvasive Optogenetics Realized by iPSC&#8208;Derived Tentacled Carrier in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling stem cell differentiation to produce functional vesicles offers a promising approach for novel delivery carriers. This study explores the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into &#8216;tentacled&#8217; stem cells, utilizing their derived &#8216;tentacled&#8217; vesicles as functional carriers to facilitate non&#8208;invasive, enhanced optogenetic therapy, offering a novel therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Neural&#8208;activated optogenetics technique contributing to the &#8220;restart&#8221; of degenerative neurons offers hope for the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the limitations of persistent invasiveness and inadequate repair of the pathological environment strongly hinder its further application. Here, a concept of differentiating stem cells is proposed to produce functional materials to enhance the therapeutic applicability of optogenetics. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are differentiated to generate the &#8220;tentacled&#8221; stem cells TenSCs. Their &#8220;tentacled&#8221; vesicles TenSCev, upon inheriting the biological functions of the parent cell, will possess both neural targeting capacity and pathological environment repair ability. Hence, TenSCev are utilized as functional carrier to deliver optogenetics elements for completely non&#8208;traumatic and controllable neuron activation, while also facilitating the comprehensive restoration of the pathological environment, thus effectively halted disease progression and significantly improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease or aged mice. Further, the concept of generating specialized biomaterials from differentiated stem cells as functional carriers holds the potential to broaden the applicability of various neuroregulatory techniques in the treatment of neurological disorders.

         <title>Influence of Ion Size on Structure and Redox Chemistry in Na&#8208;Rich and Li&#8208;Rich Disordered Rocksalt Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The larger ion size of Na+ versus with Li+ has a pronounced impact on the intercalation chemistry of disordered rocksalt cathode materials. On charge, the disordered rocksalt structure is retained in Li2MnO2F but it is lost in Na2MnO2F resulting in extensive amorphization. The larger ion size also lowers the average voltage enabling higher capacities between equivalent voltage limits.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich disordered rocksalts are promising next&#8208;generation cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Recent reports have shown it is also possible to obtain Na&#8208;rich disordered rocksalts, however, it is currently poorly understood how the knowledge of the structural and redox chemistry translates from the Li&#8208;rich to the Na&#8208;rich analogs. Here, the properties of Li2MnO2F and Na2MnO2F are compared, which have different ion sizes (Li+ = 0.76 vs Na+ = 1.02 &#197;) but the same disordered rocksalt structure and stoichiometry. It is found that Na2MnO2F exhibits lower voltage Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;redox couples, opening access to a wider compositional range within the same voltage limits. Furthermore, the intercalation mechanism switches from predominantly single&#8208;phase solid solution behavior in Li2MnO2F to a two&#8208;phase transition in Na2MnO2F, accompanied by a greater decrease in the average Mn&#9472;O/F bond length. Li2MnO2F retains its long&#8208;range disordered rocksalt structure throughout the first cycle. In contrast, Na2MnO2F becomes completely amorphous during charge and develops a local structure characteristic of a post&#8208;spinel. This amorphization is partially reversible on discharge. The results show how the ion intercalation behavior of disordered rocksalts differs dramatically when changing from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;ions and offers routes to control the electrochemical properties of these high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Over Tenfold Increase in Current Amplification Due to Anisotropic Polymer Chain Alignment in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to boost the IDS output of an OECT? Anisotropic polymer alignment along the channel direction enables a 13&#8208;fold increase in IDS. Such channel engineering opens the door to unprecedented signal amplification (here gmL/Wd = 2 580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a PBTTT&#8208;backbone bearing single&#8208;ether side chains), faster ON/OFF switching, and improved stability for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are central to the development of highly sensitive (bio)sensors, energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic devices, and high&#8208;precision electrophysiological monitoring systems. With growing interest in these strategic electronic devices, a novel PBTTT polymer bearing single&#8208;ether side chains (PBTTT&#8208;8O) in OECTs is investigated. Pristine isotropic non&#8208;aligned OECT performance matches state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transconductance, highlighting the potential of single ethers for designing high&#8208;performance organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). Moreover, a 13&#215; enhancement of current output is achieved by anisotropic polymer chain alignment of PBTTT&#8208;8O, opening doors to unprecedented device sensitivity. Compared to pristine ones, aligned OECTs afford a 6&#215; increase in the normalized transconductance (gmL/Wd), reaching an unprecedented 2&#160;580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Such improvement is mainly due to a gain in carrier mobility &#181;, as evidenced by four distinct methods. In addition, aligned OECTs exhibit faster doping front propagation, ON switching, and OFF switching compared to pristine ones. This study hence reports a versatile and easily transferable approach to concomitantly boost signal amplification and accelerate the response time of bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Intrinsically&#8208;Stretchable and Patternable Quantum Dot Color Conversion Layers for Stretchable Displays in Robotic Skin and Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dot color conversion layers are produced via a versatile crosslinking strategy. The color conversion layers exhibit minimal backlight leakage under mechanical strain, support high&#8208;resolution patterning, and integrate seamlessly with micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes. Their incorporation in haptic&#8208;responsive robotic skin and wearable healthcare sensors highlights their potential for next&#8208;generation stretchable displays.








Abstract
Stretchable displays are essential components as signal outputs in next&#8208;generation stretchable electronics, particularly for robotic skin and wearable device technologies. Intrinsically&#8208;stretchable and patternable color conversion layers (CCLs) offer practical solutions for developing full&#8208;color stretchable micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) displays. However, significant challenges remain in creating stretchable and patternable CCLs without backlight leakage under mechanical deformation. Here, a novel material strategy for stretchable and patternable heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dot (QD) CCLs, potentially useful for robotic skin and wearable electronics is presented. Through a versatile crosslinking technique, uniform and high&#8208;concentration QD loading in the elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane matrix without loss of optical properties is achieved. These CCLs demonstrate excellent color conversion capabilities with minimal backlight leakage, even under 50% tensile strain. Additionally, fine&#8208;pixel patterning process with resolutions up to 300 pixels per inch is compatible with the QD CCLs, suitable for high&#8208;resolution stretchable display applications. The integration of these CCLs with micro&#8208;LED displays is also demonstrated, showcasing their use in haptic&#8208;responsive robotic skin and wearable healthcare monitoring sensors. This study offers a promising material preparation methodology for stretchable QDs/polymer composites and highlights their potential for advancing flexible and wearable light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and High Color Purity Solution&#8208;Processable Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs Enabled by Linearly Fully Fused Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Design</title>

         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue OLEDs are achieved by designing a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type tetraborate emitter with intramoleuclar noncovalent interactions and highly distorted structure, since such emitter promots high color purity satisfying the BT.2020 standard and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate. The nonsensitized solution&#8208;processed deep&#8208;blue device achieves the best performance among wet LEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.08.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention from academia and industry because of their advantages such as low production cost and suitability for large&#8208;scale production. However, solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue OLEDs that simultaneously have high efficiencies and satisfy the BT.2020 standard remain still a great challenge. To address this issue, here a tetraboron multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, tBO&#8208;4B, embedded with two soluble 2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene groups is designed and synthesized with a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type molecular structure. tBO&#8208;4B not only achieves an ultranarrow full width at half maximum of 12&#160;nm but also has a negligibly small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and large spin&#8210;orbit coupling, eventually leading to very fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (4.23 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1). The sensitizer&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed OLED exploiting tBO&#8208;4B as the emitter achieves an ultrahigh maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.3%, with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.147, 0.042) meeting the BT.2020 blue standard. In addition, the corresponding sensitizer&#8208;free vacuum&#8208;processed deep&#8208;blue devices also exhibit an impressive EQEmax of 39.6% and mild efficiency roll&#8208;off with CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.043). This work will facilitate the development of high&#8208;efficiency ultrapure deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF materials for solution&#8208; and vacuum&#8208;processed OLEDs.

The nonsensitized solution-processed deep-blue device achieves the best performance among wet LEDs with CIE&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.08.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution-processable organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention from academia and industry because of their advantages such as low production cost and suitability for large-scale production. However, solution-processable deep-blue OLEDs that simultaneously have high efficiencies and satisfy the BT.2020 standard remain still a great challenge. To address this issue, here a tetraboron multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitter, tBO-4B, embedded with two soluble 2,12-di-tert-butyl-5,9-dioxa-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de]anthracene groups is designed and synthesized with a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor-type molecular structure. tBO-4B not only achieves an ultranarrow full width at half maximum of 12&#160;nm but also has a negligibly small singlet-triplet energy gap and large spin&#8210;orbit coupling, eventually leading to very fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (4.23 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The sensitizer-free solution-processed OLED exploiting tBO-4B as the emitter achieves an ultrahigh maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 30.3%, with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.147, 0.042) meeting the BT.2020 blue standard. In addition, the corresponding sensitizer-free vacuum-processed deep-blue devices also exhibit an impressive EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 39.6% and mild efficiency roll-off with CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.043). This work will facilitate the development of high-efficiency ultrapure deep-blue MR-TADF materials for solution- and vacuum-processed OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Transport and Carrier Polarity Tuning by Electrolyte Gating in Nickel Benzenehexathiol Coordination Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that charge transport in nickel benzenehexathiol coordination nanosheets is governed by variable&#8208;range hopping reflecting structural disorder. Electrolyte gating induces a switch in dominant carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type and leads to an improvement in thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Coordination nanosheets (CONASHs) or conjugated metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with distinctive metal&#8208;organic bonding structures exhibit promise for electronics, sensing, and energy storage. Porous Nickel&#8208;Benzene hexathiol complex (Ni&#8208;BHT) with noteworthy conductivity was first reported a decade ago, and recent synthetic modifications produced non&#8208;porous Ni&#8208;BHT with enhanced conductivity (&#8776;50 S cm&#8722;1). Here the charge transport physics of such non&#8208;porous Ni&#8208;BHT films are studied with even higher conductivity (&#8776;112 S cm&#8722;1). In contrast to the thermally activated electrical conductivity, thermoelectric measurements suggest an intrinsic metallic nature of Ni&#8208;BHT. It is shown that it is possible to tune the Fermi level and carrier polarity in Ni&#8208;BHT by electrolyte gating; gating is initially governed by the formation of an interfacial, electric double layer and then evolves into an electrochemical (de)doping process. These findings not only contribute to a deeper understanding of charge transport in CONASHs, but also show that Fermi level tuning is an effective approach for enhancing the thermoelectric performance of CONASHs.

         <title>Tailored Design of Mesoporous Metal Organic Framework Single Crystals by Kinetics&#8208;Mediated Micelle Assembly for Efficient Asymmetrical Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is established for the controllable synthesis of mesoporous MOFs (MesoMOFs) with diverse compositions and mesophases. The customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of a new class of mesoporous asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysts rich in catalytically accessible CoN3O sites, with enhanced localized electrons around Co center and upshifted d&#8208;band center, for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).








Abstract
Constructing mesoporous metal organic frameworks (MesoMOFs) with customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment is pivotal for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis, yet it is impeded by the strong self&#8208;growth tendency of MOFs. In this work, a novel kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is introduced to realize the general fabrication of mesoporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) single crystals. Spectroscopic characterizations and cryo&#8208;electron cryomicroscopy reveal that the strategic use of water accelerates the MOFs kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly via enhancing ligand deprotonation, which suppresses the MOFs self&#8208;growth, facilitating the cooperative assembly of micelles and MOFs. Furthermore, the water amount can modulate the Flory&#8208;Huggins interaction parameters between the solvents and micelles, thereby precisely controlling the pore architectures from spherical, cylindrical to vesicular. Such versatile synthesis creates a new class of mesoporous asymmetric CoN3O single&#8208;atom catalyst. Synchrotron spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover that this asymmetric geometry localizes more electrons around Co center and upshift the d&#8208;band center, stabilizing O* intermediates and promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, the asymmetric mesoporous catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V in alkaline media) and a high power density (185&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in a zinc&#8208;air battery. This work provides a new approach for designing MesoMOFs for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite&#8208;Gated Organic Phototransistors for Efficient UV/DUV Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite&#8208;gated phototransistors (PGPTs) using wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dual&#8208;function dielectric and photoresponsive layers are introduced. By decoupling photoresponse and charge transport, the PGPTs achieve exceptional UV/DUV detection performance at low operating voltages, with scalability and material flexibility. This innovative approach offers a cost&#8208;effective, versatile platform for advanced photodetectors, enabling applications in telecommunications, imaging, and solar&#8208;blind detection.








Abstract
Conventional UV/DUV phototransistors, which rely on wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor channels, encounter issues with material availability, processing complexity, and performance tunability. Perovskite&#8208;gated phototransistors (PGPTs) are introduced that decouple photoresponse and charge transport by using wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dielectric layers and non&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors as channels. This design offers material flexibility, simplified processing, and enhanced performance. Using the 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskite PEA2PbBr4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.0&#160;eV) as the dielectric layer and the organic semiconductor (OSC) P3HT as the channel layer, UV phototransistors are successfully achieved with exceptional photodetection performance at operating voltages below 2&#160;V, exhibiting a responsivity of 1960&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1, a specific detectivity of 3&#160; &#215; &#160;1011 Jones, and a response time of &#8776;20&#160;ms. Fabricated via low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;100 &#176;C) solution processing, this approach facilitates scalable production and is adaptable to various OSCs and other wide&#8208;bandgap MHP dielectrics, such as PEA2PbCl4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.6&#160;eV) and PEA2SnI4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;eV), extending their potential for DUV detection. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an optical decoder for telecommunications is demonstrated using DUV PEA2PbCl4/PDVT&#8208;10 PGPTs, which are immune to ambient light interference. Additionally, these DUV phototransistors show potential for latent fingerprint detection due to their sensitivity to skin absorption characteristics.

         <title>Nonvolatile Electric Control of Ferromagnetism in Van Der Waals Multiferroic Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first demonstration of the nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization modulation of magnetic domains in van der Waals multiferroic Fe3GaTe2/CuInP2S6 heterostructures at ambient conditions, which is primarily attributed to the ferroelectric polarization&#8208;controlled Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Multiferroic heterostructures offer a promising platform for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power spintronic devices by enabling electric&#8208;field control of magnetism. While recent advances in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic and ferroelectric materials have sparked significant interest, achieving reliable and nonvolatile electrical modulation of magnetism at room temperature within vdW multiferroic heterostructures remains a substantial challenge. Here, this study demonstrates robust, reproducible, and nonvolatile electrical control of ferromagnetism in Fe3GaTe2/CuInP2S6 multiferroic heterostructures under ambient conditions.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents the first demonstration of the nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization modulation of magnetic domains in van der Waals multiferroic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures at ambient conditions, which is primarily attributed to the ferroelectric polarization-controlled Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiferroic heterostructures offer a promising platform for next-generation low-power spintronic devices by enabling electric-field control of magnetism. While recent advances in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic and ferroelectric materials have sparked significant interest, achieving reliable and nonvolatile electrical modulation of magnetism at room temperature within vdW multiferroic heterostructures remains a substantial challenge. Here, this study demonstrates robust, reproducible, and nonvolatile electrical control of ferromagnetism in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; multiferroic heterostructures under ambient conditions. The modulation is evidenced macroscopically by reshaped magnetic hysteresis loops in anomalous Hall voltage measurements and microscopically by in situ magnetic and electric field-induced domain evolution captured via magnetic force microscopy. The first-principles calculations reveal that the polarization of CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; induces a significant modulation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Incorporating these effects into micromagnetic simulations reproduces key features of the experimental hysteresis behaviors, indicating that the polarization-enhanced DMI lowers domain wall formation energy and drives a transition from coherent to incoherent magnetic reversal. These findings not only surmount the challenge of electrically modulating ferromagnetism in vdW systems via remanent ferroelectric polarization at room temperature but also open new pathways for energy-efficient skyrmion manipulation and vdW spintronic device engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Nonfouling and Cell&#8208;Binding Polysulfobetaine Inducing Fast Transcytosis for Tumor&#8208;Active Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the N&#8208;alkyl chain length in polysulfobetaine&#8208;based zwitterionic micelles enables precise tuning of nanocarrier interactions with proteins and cell membranes. The optimized micelles comprising&#160;poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone) with N&#8208;butyl substituent (PSB4&#8208;PCL), which are protein&#8208;resistant yet cell membrane&#8208;philic, achieve a unique balance between prolonged circulation and efficient tumor transcytosis, leading to enhanced intratumoral accumulation, deep penetration, and potent antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake are essential yet paradoxical requirements for efficient tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery carriers. For instance, polyzwitterions, generally nonfouling to proteins and cells, have been extensively explored as long&#8208;circulating drug delivery carriers but suffer ultraslow cell internalization, making them inefficient in delivering drugs to cells. Protein&#8208;resistant yet cell membrane&#8208;binding polymers will simultaneously achieve long blood circulation and fast cellular internalization, but their designs are generally complicated, such as introducing cell&#8208;membrane binding groups. Here, it is shown that the N&#8208;alkyl chain length of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine) can be used to tune its affinity toward proteins and cell membranes. A poly(sulfobetaine) with a moderately long N&#8208;alkyl chain became cell membrane&#8208;philic while retaining protein resistance, leading to long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake, which further triggered efficient tumor cell transcytosis and intratumor penetration. Thus, its paclitaxel (PTX)&#8208;loaded micelles demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models. This study showcases a paradigm of designing polyzwitterions harmonizing long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake properties as tumor&#8208;active drug delivery carriers.

         <title>Atomistic Mechanisms of the Crystallographic Orientation&#8208;Dependent Cu1.8S Conductive Channel Formation in Cu2S&#8208;Based Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compliance current can be utilized to control the volatile and nonvolatile resistive switching behaviors of &#947;&#8208;Cu2S, which results from the &#947;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;Cu2S phase transition and orientation&#8208;dependent formation (along &#947;&#8208;Cu2S [201]) of high&#8208;digenite Cu1.8S conductive channels, respectively. The Cu1.8S channels form from an intermediate &#948;&#8208;Cu2S phase through the directional Cu+ migration along &#948;&#8208;Cu2S [001].








Abstract
Achieving multiple types of resistive switching in a single material with controlled ionic motion is a key challenge in neuromorphic computing, traditionally addressed by combining materials with distinct switching behaviors. Here, Cu2&#8208;xS is identified as a promising candidate to overcome this limitation due to its hierarchical phase transitions. Using in situ biasing experiments, reversible and non&#8208;reversible phase transitions (and resistive switching) are demonstrated in &#947;&#8208;Cu2S by controlling the compliance current. The formation of parallel high&#8208;digenite Cu1.8S channels, orientated along the &#947;&#8208;Cu2S [201] crystallographic direction, drives the nonvolatile resistive switching. These channels emerge via an intermediate &#948;&#8208;Cu2S phase and are stabilized at room temperature by residual strains, alongside &#946;&#8208;Cu2S phase. The work clarifies the complex, electrically triggered phase transformations in &#947;&#8208;Cu2S, and highlights the potential of Cu2&#8208;xS as a versatile material for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Flexible Selenium Nanowires with Tuneable Electronic Bandgaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanotubes serve as effective test tubes for selenium nanowires, as their diameter precisely controls the width of the nanowires and the Se&#9472;Se bonding, resulting in a variety of different structures. An electron beam can be used to modify the nanotubes, allowing real&#8208;time observation of the nanowire extrusion process. Additionally, optically transparent boron nitride nanotubes enable direct bandgap measurements for individual nanowires, revealing the interplay between various phenomena occurring at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Manipulating semiconductor properties without altering their chemical composition holds promise for electronic and optical materials. However, linking atomic positions in nanomaterials to their functional properties is challenging due to their polydispersity. This study utilizes nano test tubes to uncover distinct phases of selenium, an elemental semiconductor, demonstrating a remarkable structural plasticity between 0.4 and 3.0 nm. These structures are correlated with their electronic bandgaps, ranging from 2.2 to 2.5 eV, using ultra&#8208;low&#8208;loss electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy for individual nanowires in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). Notably, the variation in bandgaps diverges from that of bulk selenium and is non&#8208;monotonic on the host&#8208;nanotube diameter, indicating that conformational distortions in selenium chains begin counteracting quantum confinement effects at sub&#8208;nm scales. A 1D phase diagram predicting selenium's atomic structure based on nanotube diameter, regardless of the chemistry of the host nanotube is developed, which can be BNNT or carbon nanotubes. Phase changes in selenium nanowires are imaged in real&#8208;time by transmission electron microscopy using BNNT as a test tube with an adjustable diameter. These nanoscale findings pave the way for the development of advanced miniature tuneable and flexible electronic components, including transistors, optical sensors, and photovoltaics.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress&#8208;Specific Nanoinducer Selectively Evokes Type&#8208;II Immunogenic Cell Death for Pyroptotic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a pH/cathepsin dual&#8208;gated nanoplatform (PCANER) enabling tumor&#8208;responsive, precise endoplasmic reticulum (ER) delivery of photosensitizers to induce type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death and pyroptosis. With 83% ER&#8208;targeted efficacy, PCANER promotes glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78/calreticulin exposure and reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, establishing a subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted immunomodulation paradigm for cancer therapy.








Abstract
Specific induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress&#8208;initiated type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death (ICD) shows great potential in boosting tumor immunogenicity and anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy. However, it remains challenging to selectively provoke type&#8208;II ICD, due to the lack of highly efficient ER targeting strategy. Here, a pH/Cathepsin&#8208;Activatable Nanoplatform (PCAN) is reported to specifically photo&#8208;induce ER stress (PCANER) and type&#8208;II ICD for cancer immunotherapy. PCANER integrates the long&#8208;circulating properties of nanomedicines with pH/cathepsin B dual&#8208;gated design, exhibiting excellent ER targeting with a colocalization efficacy of 83% in cancer tissues. Through directly intensifying glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78 and calreticulin exposure, PCANER augments type&#8208;II ICD and pyroptotic cancer cell death with high immune priming to cascade&#8208;amplify the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle, while the mild type&#8208;I ICD induced by lysosome stress (PCANLy) exhibits negligible antitumor efficacy. By leveraging the spatiotemporal subcellular organelle targeting of PCAN technology, this study achieves precise tuning of the type of ICD and cellular pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy. This study offers new insights into the design of organelle level&#8208;targeted nanomedicines, paving the way for dissecting and modulating the cell death mechanism to boost cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;This study develops a pH/cathepsin dual-gated nanoplatform (PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt;) enabling tumor-responsive, precise endoplasmic reticulum (ER) delivery of photosensitizers to induce type-II immunogenic cell death and pyroptosis. With 83% ER-targeted efficacy, PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt; promotes glucose-regulated protein 78/calreticulin exposure and reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, establishing a subcellular organelle-targeted immunomodulation paradigm for cancer therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-initiated type-II immunogenic cell death (ICD) shows great potential in boosting tumor immunogenicity and anti-tumor immunotherapy. However, it remains challenging to selectively provoke type-II ICD, due to the lack of highly efficient ER targeting strategy. Here, a pH/Cathepsin-Activatable Nanoplatform (PCAN) is reported to specifically photo-induce ER stress (PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt;) and type-II ICD for cancer immunotherapy. PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt; integrates the long-circulating properties of nanomedicines with pH/cathepsin B dual-gated design, exhibiting excellent ER targeting with a colocalization efficacy of 83% in cancer tissues. Through directly intensifying glucose-regulated protein 78 and calreticulin exposure, PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt; augments type-II ICD and pyroptotic cancer cell death with high immune priming to cascade-amplify the cancer-immunity cycle, while the mild type-I ICD induced by lysosome stress (PCAN&lt;sup&gt;Ly&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibits negligible antitumor efficacy. By leveraging the spatiotemporal subcellular organelle targeting of PCAN technology, this study achieves precise tuning of the type of ICD and cellular pyroptosis-based cancer therapy. This study offers new insights into the design of organelle level-targeted nanomedicines, paving the way for dissecting and modulating the cell death mechanism to boost cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Kagome Metallic Composite Realizes Mechanically Axial Zero Thermal Expansion up to 800 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kagome metallic composite is used to prepare high&#8208;strength two&#8208;phase zero thermal expansion alloys. By in situ precipitation of the plastic &#945;&#8208;(Fe/Co) phase yields zero thermal expansion alloys with ultra&#8208;wide temperature windows and excellent compressive strength. This method can be extended to other Fe&#8208;based negative thermal expansion systems for high performance in the future.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal structure and microstructure is fundamentally paramount for designing advanced materials with enhanced functionalities. Kagome&#8208;lattice metals attracted considerable attention due to desirable electronic and magnetic properties but are rarely considered for application as structural materials. In this study, a concept of kagome composite is proposed to realize mechanically zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloy over a wide temperature window, exemplified by the Lu&#8208;Fe&#8208;Co ternary alloys prepared by two&#8208;step synthesis. Using magnetic Co doping, the kagome lattice magnetic order is stabilized in the parent hexagonal Lu2Fe17 structure, and its thermal expansion regulated simultaneously. By in situ precipitation of the &#945;&#8208;(Fe/Co) phase in the matrix, a soft/hard heterogeneous structure emerges and an ultra&#8208;wide temperature window axial ZTE composite (&#945;l = +0.98 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1, 110&#8211;800 K) with good compressive strength (1.11&#160;GPa) is achieved. This work opens up the prospect of kagome intermetallic composite in the integration of structure and function.

         <title>Engineering Cellular Self&#8208;Adhesions Inside 3D Printed Micro&#8208;Arches to Enhance Cell:Biomaterial Attachment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly, a cell can bind to itself to make a self&#8208;adhesion, which engineered here to improve how cells attach to biomaterials. Nanoprinting are used to make 3D structures smaller than cells&#8211;called Self&#8208;Adhesion&#8208;Tunnels (SATs)&#8211;around which cells can wrap and bind to themselves. These self&#8208;adhesions improve cell attachment stability and offer a new approach for biomaterial design.








Abstract
A cell can bind to itself and form a self&#8208;adhesion that can be engineered and harnessed as a new way to adhere cells to engineered materials&#8211;a key challenge for biomaterials are demonstrated. Here, a 3D structure smaller is developed than a single cell, that a Self&#8208;Adhesion&#8208;Tunnel (SAT) is called, that causes cells to wrap around it and bind to themselves. This process is driven through the cadherin proteins that regulate cell&#8208;cell adhesion, and it is shown that many of the key elements of a normal cell&#8208;cell adhesion are found in self&#8208;adhesions. Size and shape of the SAT determine the efficiency of&#160;self&#8208;adhesion&#160;formation, and &gt;90% efficient formation of self&#8208;adhesions are observed in both kidney and skin cells per SAT. Self&#8208;adhesions can persist for at least 24&#160;hrs and act to stabilize the cell&#8208;material interface and reduce migration. Overall, this ability to co&#8208;opt the native cell&#8208;cell adhesion machinery in cells and use it as an attachment strategy can provide new approaches for soft&#8208;tissue implant integration and tissue engineering scaffolds where stable tissue&#8208;material interfaces are critical.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Agent&#8208;Network&#8208;Based Idea Generator for Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Electrolyte Discovery: A Case Study on Zinc Tetrafluoroborate Hydrate&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An LLM&#8208;based multi&#8208;agent network screens academic literature to propose multiple environmentally friendly aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Experiments identify an optimal composition of Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O and ethylene carbonate, which shows high conductivity and cycling stability. Spectroscopy and simulations confirm corrosion suppression and stable solid electrolyte interphases, establishing an AI&#8208;driven paradigm for electrolyte discovery.








Abstract
Aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) offer great potential for low&#8208;cost zinc&#8208;ion batteries but often have limited performance. Discovering new electrolytes is therefore crucial, yet time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive. In response, this work presents a Large Language Model (LLM)&#8208;based multi&#8208;agent network that proposes DEE compositions for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By analyzing academic papers from the DEE field, the network identifies innovative, inexpensive, and sustainable Lewis bases to pair with Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O. A Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O&#8208;ethylene carbonate (EC) system demonstrates high conductivity (10.6 mS cm&#8722;1) and a wide electrochemical stability window (2.37&#160;V). The optimized electrolyte enables stable zinc stripping/plating, achieves outstanding rate performance (81 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and supports 4000 cycles in Zn||polyaniline cells at 3 A g&#8722;1. Spectroscopic analyses and simulations reveal that EC coordinates to Zn2+, mitigating water&#8208;induced corrosion, while a fluorine&#8208;rich hybrid organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interphase enhances stability. This work showcases a pioneering LLM&#8208;driven approach to electrolyte development, establishing a new paradigm in materials research.

         <title>Enhancing Thermal Tolerance for Bright and Stable Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers developed ultra&#8208;stable near&#8208;infrared perovskite LEDs with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &gt;20% from 70 to 1200 mA cm&#8722;2, resulting in an ultra&#8208;high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. Furthermore, these PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability at high current densities. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite under elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation display technologies, owing to their high efficiency and color purity. However, the operational instability of PeLEDs at high current densities (&gt;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) remains a significant challenge. Here, near&#8208;infrared (&#8776;797&#160;nm) PeLEDs are reported with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &gt;20% across a wide range of current densities (70&#8211;1200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), resulting in an ultra&#8208;high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. These PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability with operational lifetimes (T50) of 6.6, 12.7, 19.2, 49.5, 238.6, and 350&#160;h at current densities of 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, and 50&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation display technologies, owing to their high efficiency and color purity. However, the operational instability of PeLEDs at high current densities (&amp;gt;100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) remains a significant challenge. Here, near-infrared (&#8776;797&#160;nm) PeLEDs are reported with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &amp;gt;20% across a wide range of current densities (70&#8211;1200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), resulting in an ultra-high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Eliminating Positive Aging in Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by H2O&#8208;Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post&#8208;annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, could promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) usually exhibit a positive aging phenomenon with their efficiency and brightness increase after storage for several days. Although positive aging enhances device performance, its random and uncontrollable process presents substantial challenges for QLED industrialization. Here, It is identified that the H2O, produced by the reaction between the acidic resin and ZnMgO, can slowly passivate the defects of ZnMgO and is thus responsible for the positive aging. By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post&#8208;annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. As a result, the fresh devices exhibit a high efficiency of 55.2&#160;lm W&#8722;1 (26%), which is 2.04 (1.67)&#8208;fold higher than those of untreated devices and 1.21 (1.02)&#8208;fold higher than those of untreated devices after positive aging. Moreover, the performance of the treated devices remains very stable even after storage for several days, indicating the undesired positive aging is completely eliminated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, can promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.

         <title>Ultralight and Elastic Polyimide Microtube Aerogel via Airflow&#8208;Induced Spinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports the one&#8208;step preparation of ultralight polyimide microtube aerogel sponges (PMAS) using airflow&#8208;induced spinning. PMAS has ultralow density, excellent thermal insulation properties and compression resilience over a wide temperature range, and can be applied in thermal insulation. Notably, airflow&#8208;induced spinning technology fills the gaps in industrial&#8208;scale preparation and material compatibility of microtube.








Abstract
Flexible thermal protection is of great significance in fields facing various environments such as aerospace and electric vehicles. Elastic aerogels with micro&#8208;nanofibers as the base unit effectively solve the force&#8208;thermal compatibility, optimized the contradiction between mechanical strength and thermal insulation performance, and solves the risk of fragile aerogel. In order to develop elastic aerogels with lower density and better thermal insulation properties. Here, the first one&#8208;step preparation of ultralight polyimide microtube aerogel sponges (PMAS) using airflow&#8208;induced spinning is reported. PMAS consists of a large number of structurally controllable microtube, resulting in ultralight density (&#8776;50&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3), ultralow thermal conductivity (37&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#183;K at 25&#160;&#176;C), and excellent elasticity and fatigue resistance, with no significant attenuation of the maximum stress after 1000 cycles of compression at 80% strain. In addition, PMAS has temperature&#8208;invariant dynamic mechanical stability and an operating temperature range from 77 to 573 K. These superior properties enable PMAS to be ideal choice for thermal insulation in extreme environments, thermal runaway in batteries, adsorption and gas filling. Airflow&#8208;induced spinning fills the gap in the industrial&#8208;scale preparation and material compatibility of microtube, while also providing a promising solution for the universal preparation of microtube structures.

         <title>Hybridizing Electrode Interface Structures in Protonic Ceramic Cells for Durable, Reversible Hydrogen and Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>

A hybrid oxygen electrode combining PrOx nanoparticles with a PrNi0.7Co0.3O3&#8211;&#948; (PNC) backbone significantly boosts PCEC performance, achieving a current density of 2.25&#160;A&#160;cm&#8315;2 at 1.30&#160;V in electrolysis mode and a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8%. This approach enhances catalytic activity and stability, advancing scalable solutions for clean energy conversion.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) represent a transformative technology for sustainable hydrogen production and power generation by converting energy between chemical and electrical forms. Operating at intermediate temperatures, PCECs utilize proton&#8208;conducting electrolytes, achieving high efficiency and reduced degradation. However, a major bottleneck lies at the oxygen electrode due to sluggish kinetics and limited active sites. To address this, we present a hybrid oxygen electrode featuring PrNi0.7Co0.3O3&#8211;&#948; (PNC) backbone infused with oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich praseodymium oxide (PrOx) nanoparticles. This design leverages the interplay between surface and bulk properties to enhance oxygen adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic kinetics. The PrOx introduces abundant oxygen vacancies and modulates the d&#8208;band center for optimal adsorption energy, while the PNC backbone provides robust proton conduction and stabilizes reaction intermediates. Cells incorporating this hybrid electrode demonstrate a peak power density of 1.56 W cm&#8722;2 at 600 &#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.25 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.30 V in electrolysis mode. Faradaic and energy efficiency reach 96.8% and 89.9%, respectively, with exceptional thermal cycling stability and reduced polarization resistance (0.079 &#937; cm2). This study underscores the potential of advanced electrode architectures to enhance the efficiency, durability, and applicability of PCECs in renewable energy systems.

This architecture ensures structural resilience, efficient ion transport, and stress&#8208;resistant integrity, achieving high capacity (2945 mAh g&#8315;1), ultralow swelling (14.7%), and 100% capacity retention at 6 A g&#8315;1 over 470 cycles.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;capacity battery electrodes with large volume changes remains a significant challenge, with their mechanical failure and sluggish kinetics, primarily due to inadequate structural accommodation and inefficient transport pathways. Here, a magnesiothermic crystallization approach is presented to construct origami capsule (OC) architectures, imparting flexibility and conformability to inherently brittle silicon, featuring highly interconnected 2D silicon nanosheets (2.5&#160;nm thickness) with built&#8208;in nanopores encapsulated within a pressure&#8208;tolerant conformal microshell. The design leverages geometric features at both the nanoscale (within nanosheets) and microscale (capsule assembly) to impart structural elasticity and connectivity for efficient stress dissipation, enhancing mechanical integrity and rapid transport kinetics. Consequently, the OC anode exhibits low electrode swelling (14.7%) at 2945 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional rate capability, delivering a high capacity and &#8776;100% retention after 470 cycles at a large current density of 6 A g&#8722;1. This work bridges geometric design and materials science, opening new avenues for high&#8208;performance energy storage solutions.

         <title>Interface Modification of Single Atom&#8208;Nanocluster Synergistic Sites to Break the Activity&#8208;Selectivity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Selective Hydrogenations</title>

         <dc:description>
The interfacial modification strategy is introduced to precisely tailor the interface and electronic structure of palladium single atoms and clusters (Pd1+Pdn) synergistic sites. Catalytic experiments and spectroscopic characterization revealed site&#8208;specific adsorption&#8211;desorption behaviors and interface&#8208;enhanced H&#8208;spillover capacities on NC&#8208;modified Pd1+Pdn synergistic sites, thus achieving remarkable enhancements in activity, selectivity, and stability for selective hydrogenation reactions.








Abstract
Synergistic sites (M1+Mn) integrating single atoms (M1) and clusters (Mn) exhibit tremendous promise for overcoming linear scaling relationships. However, metal entities spatial segregation within synergistic sites impedes the overall optimization and structure&#8208;property analysis, and the support interface of the M1 and Mn sites critical for intermediate adsorption&#8208;transfer kinetics has yet unexplored. Here, for the first time, interfacial modification strategy is proposed to modulate the interface and electronic structure of M1+Mn sites. This is systematically altered that the interface of Pd1+Pdn sites from hydroxyapatite (HAP) to nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;modified HAP (NC/HAP) and pure NC, with all sites maintaining the comparable size and content. In the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes, volcano&#8208;type correlations between Pd1+Pdn sites with varying interfaces and hydrogenation activities are observed, peaking for those supported on NC/HAP. The obtained Pd1+Pdn@NC/HAP exhibits superior activity for alkynol&#8208;to&#8208;enol conversion, achieving a formation rate up to 3707.7&#160;mol molPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 while maintaining 97.2% selectivity. Comprehensive investigations propose d&#8208;band center of Pd1+Pdn sites with different interfaces as a descriptor to elucidate the volcano&#8208;type correlation for various selective hydrogenation reactions. Interfacial modification of Pd1+Pdn sites can optimize their electronic structure, adeptly managing substrates adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetic and interface H&#8208;spillover between segregated metal sites, thereby breaking &#8722;the activity&#8208;selectivity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off.

         <title>Highly Specific Cytokine Receptor&#8208;Targeting Chimeras for Targeted Membrane Protein Degradation and Sensitization of Osimertinib in EGFR&#8208;Mutated Non&#8208;Small&#8208;Cell Lung Cancer</title>

CXCR7&#8208;targeting chimeras (AP&#8208;CRTACs), which are constructed by covalently linking a membrane protein&#8208;targeting aptamer with a mutant&#8208;CXCL12 mimic peptide, can specifically harness the scavenge receptor CXCR7 to direct membrane proteins of interest (POIs) to the lysosome for degradation, while eliminating the effects of CXCL12 on its another receptor CXCR4 activation and tumor cell viability.








Abstract
The ability of cytokine receptors to mediate the internalization of targets in lysosomes positions them as specific and effective effectors for protein degradation strategies. However, challenges remain, including the potential unintended activation of cell&#8208;proliferation&#8208;related cytokine receptors, as well as limitations in programmability and structural flexibility of protein degradators. In this work, a CXCR7&#8208;targeting chimera (AP&#8208;CRTAC) that functions as a CXCR7 inducer by covalently linking a membrane protein&#8208;targeting aptamer with a mutant&#8208;CXCL12 mimic peptide is developed. This peptide selectively binds to CXCR7 without activating CXCR4. The AP&#8208;CRTAC, which incorporates various aptamer forms from DNA, RNA, or even bispecific aptamers, has shown significant efficacy in degrading one or more proteins or protein mutants on the cell surface. Moreover, the AP&#8208;CRTAC constructed with a 2&#8242; F&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;modified RNA aptamer targeting EGFR effectively degrades various EGFR activating mutations. Notably, AP&#8208;CRTAC enhances the sensitivity of the L858R/T790M/C797S triple mutant lung cancer cells, which are resistant to current EGFR&#8208;targeted therapies, to the third&#8208;generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This research introduces an engineered CXCR7 inducer with high specificity and programmability for the targeted degradation of cell surface proteins, while minimizing unwanted side effects.

         <title>Atomic Scale Engineering of Multivalence&#8208;State Palladium Photocatalyst for Transfer Hydrogenation with Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation is achieved over a multivalence&#8208;state palladium photocatalyst, in which protons generated from photocatalytic water splitting are added to unsaturated double bonds. The operando light&#8208;induced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms the synergistic action between Pd single atoms and nanoparticles, in which the H&#8208; produced by palladium nanoparticles migrate to single atoms where the substrate is located, resulting in hydrogenation reaction.









Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions are fundamental in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries, however heavily relying on H2 gas at high temperatures and pressures, incurring large energy and carbon costs. Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, using water as a proton source, offers a greener alternative, but&#160;existing photocatalysts often suffer from&#160;modest yields, limited selectivity, and narrow substrate scope. Additionally, they often require co&#8208;activation, such as Mg&#8208;activated water or non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen feeds. Here, a photocatalyst is introduced that offers high yields and selectivities across a broad spectrum of organic compounds. The developed photocatalyst is a multivalence palladium superstructure with&#160;ultrasmall Pd0 nanoparticles enveloped by isolated Pd2+/Pd4+ atoms within a carbon&#8208;nitride matrix. Mechanistic studies reveal that the redox&#8208;flexible Pd single atoms, with triethylamine as an electronic modulator, attract photogenerated holes for water oxidation, while Pd0 nanoparticles facilitate hydrogen transfer to the unsaturated bonds of the organic molecules. The cooperative and dynamic behavior of Pd centers during catalysis, involving transitions among Pd+2, Pd+3, and Pd+4 states, is validated using operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This multivalent palladium catalyst represents a conceptual advance in photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with water as a hydrogen source, holding promise for sustainable hydrogenation processes in the chemical industry.

         <title>Programmable Bacterial Architects Crafting Sonosensitizers for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered bacterium SPEC5, designed via genetic circuit optimization and tumor cell membrane camouflage, functions as a live drug for efficient and precise tumor&#8208;selective sonosensitizer supply. SPEC5 colonizes tumor tissues, ensuring sustained 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA) delivery into tumor cells, triggers in situ protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) biosynthesis, and enables effective treatment. This introduces a novel approach for precise SDT using living engineered bacterial therapeutics.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non&#8208;invasive cancer treatment that uses ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers for selective tumor ablation. With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off&#8208;target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic&#8208;based Calibrated 5&#8208;ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non&#8208;pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5&#8208;ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia&#8208;inducible promoter regulating O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post&#8208;treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor&#8208;specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5&#8208;ALA&#8208;based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor&#8208;targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Healing Polyurethane&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Ion&#8208;Conductive Elastomers with Exceptional Strength and Ionic Conductivity for Multifunctional Strain Sensors and Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>

         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing, recyclable polyurethane&#8208;based conductor (DACPU/100Li) is engineered via supramolecular and dynamic covalent networks, exhibiting ionic conductivity (1.23 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1), tensile strength (7.62&#160;MPa), 1200% stretchability, and tear resistance (45.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Its sensor enables machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted gesture recognition (sensitivity 5.89, strain 0.1&#8211;1000%), while its triboelectric nanogenerator harvests energy (3.87&#160;W m&#8722;2) and supports machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted object recognition.








Abstract
Flexible ionic conductors hold potential for wearable sensors and energy harvesting. However, most gel&#8208;based conductors suffer from solvent evaporation and liquid leakage, limiting practical applications. Although solid&#8208;state ionic conductors mitigate these issues, achieving strong mechanics, high conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and stability remains challenging. Here, by integrating supramolecular engineering and dynamic covalent adaptive networks, a self&#8208;healing polyurethane&#8208;based solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;conductive elastomer (DACPU/100Li) with outstanding overall properties is successfully synthesized. DACPU/100Li exhibits ultrahigh ionic conductivity (1.23 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) and high tensile strength (7.62&#160;MPa), along with an elongation at break of 1200%. Additionally, it exhibits excellent tear resistance and a fracture energy of 45.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, along with 96% self&#8208;healing efficiency (after self&#8208;healing at 120&#160;&#176;C for 24&#160;h), good recyclability, and stability under extreme conditions. The DACPU/100Li&#8208;based sensor has high sensitivity (5.89) and a wide strain range (0.1&#8211;1000%). Integrated with machine learning, it enables precise gesture recognition and human&#8211;machine interaction. Furthermore, the triboelectric nanogenerator based on DACPU/100Li achieves a high power density of 3.87&#160;W m&#8722;2. It harvests energy from body motion to power small devices and aids object recognition via machine learning. It is believed that these solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;conductive elastomers provide new opportunities for wearable electronics, energy harvesting, and ionotronics.

         <title>Natural van der Waals Canalization Lens for Non&#8208;Destructive Nanoelectronic Circuit Imaging and Inspection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Canalization&#8208;based super&#8208;resolution imaging has been achieved based on ultralow&#8208;loss and extremely anisotropic phonon polaritons in a natural van der Waals material &#945;&#8208;MoO3. This canalization lens exhibits the superior capability to resolve deeply subwavelength feature sizes down to 15&#160;nm, which represents a promising solution for non&#8208;destructive nanoelectronic circuit imaging and inspection.









Abstract
Optical inspection has long served as a cornerstone non&#8208;destructive method in semiconductor wafer manufacturing, particularly for surface and defect analysis. However, conventional techniques such as dark&#8208;field scattering optics or atomic force microscopy (AFM) face significant limitations, including insufficient resolution or the inability to resolve subsurface features. Here, an approach is proposed that integrates the strengths of dark&#8208;field scattering optics and AFM by leveraging a van der Waals (vdW) canalization lens based on natural biaxial &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystals. This method enables ultrahigh&#8208;resolution subwavelength imaging with the ability to visualize both surface and buried structures, achieving a spatial resolution of 15&#160;nm and grating pitch detection down to 100&#160;nm. The underlying mechanism relies on the unique anisotropic properties of &#945;&#8208;MoO3, where its atomic&#8208;scale unit cells and biaxial symmetry facilitate the diffraction&#8208;free propagation of both evanescent and propagating waves via a flat&#8208;band canalization regime. Unlike metamaterial&#8208;based superlenses and hyperlenses, which suffer from high plasmonic losses, fabrication imperfections, and uniaxial constraints, &#945;&#8208;MoO3 provides robust and super&#8208;resolution imaging in multiple directions. The approach is successfully applied to achieve high&#8208;resolution inspection of buried nanoscale electronic circuits, offering unprecedented capabilities essential for next&#8208;generation semiconductor manufacturing.

         <title>Sonicated Carbon Nanotube Catalysts for Efficient Point&#8208;of&#8208;use Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growing demand for freshwater and rising contamination of water sources require innovative treatment technologies. Sonicated carbon nanotubes can activate persulfate for selective contaminant degradation via nonradical pathways. This scalable approach enables rapid pollutant removal, offering a sustainable solution for decentralized freshwater production in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
The rising demand for freshwater and increasing contamination of distributed water sources, such as stormwater and surface water, necessitate innovative point&#8208;of&#8208;use treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using solid oxidants offer a promising approach for decentralized freshwater production but are often limited by nonselective radical reactions that degrade both pollutants and background water constituents. Here, sonicated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate are demonstrated, enabling selective contaminant degradation via dual nonradical pathways&#8212;singlet oxygen oxidation and direct electron transfer. Optimized sonication introduces catalytically active carbonyl (C&#9552;O) groups on CNT surfaces while preserving their graphitic structure, ensuring rapid electron transfer. This approach achieves 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol removal, a common industrial and municipal pollutant, within 5&#160;min at a record removal rate of 4.80&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, scalable CNT catalyst synthesis and integration into flat membrane and hollow fiber filtration devices, ensuring long&#8208;term stability and efficient pollutant removal in natural river water, are demonstrated. By advancing selective CNT catalysts for AOPs, this work offers a scalable, sustainable solution for point&#8208;of&#8208;use freshwater production in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Stretchable, Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Poly(urethane&#8208;urea) Elastomer Resistant to Humidity and Heat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent polyurethane with a microphase separation structure exhibits excellent stretchability properties and ultralong phosphorescence. Different afterglow color effects are achieved by modifying the structure of the phosphor. The polyurethane demonstrates remarkable resistance to humidity and heat. The potential applications of polymers in flexible light&#8208;emitting devices, information encryption systems, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies are explored.








Abstract
Polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials exhibiting facile processability, high thermal stability, and environmental compatibility have garnered considerable attention. However, achieving excellent stretchability in simultaneity with ultralong RTP remains challenging because most RTP polymers rely on rigid structures with inherently poor tensile properties. Herein, a stretchable, ultralong RTP polyurethane is prepared through copolymerizing a novel phosphor dihydroxy&#8208;functionalized indolocarbazole, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedicyclohexyl diisocyanate (HMDI), poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTMEG 2000), and adipic dihydrazide (AD). The phosphor is covalently bonded to the polyurethane backbone, which facilitates the stabilization of triplet excitons and achieves ultralong RTP. The obtained copolymers exhibit a maximum strain of 1400% and the longest phosphorescence lifetime of 1888 ms. Additionally, the polyurethanes exhibiting different afterglow colors are prepared by varying the molecular structure of the phosphor. Notably, the RTP polyurethane materials also display resistance to humidity and heat. This work may provide a new option for the development of stretchable, ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Micromotion&#8208;Driven &#8220;Mechanical&#8208;Electrical&#8208;Pharmaceutical Coupling&#8221; Bone&#8208;Guiding Membrane Modulates Stress&#8208;Concentrating Inflammation Under Diabetic Fractures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotion activates a &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;pharmaceutical&#8221; system, converting mechanical energy to electrical cues that trigger Met release. These cues suppress inflammation via M1&#8208;M2 macrophage polarization and osteogenesis enhancement, while Met blocks NF&#8208;&#954;B (reducing cytokines) and activates AMPK (promoting bone/vessel growth). In diabetic fractures, Met&#8208;PF@PPy cut inflammation, boosted vasculature, and elevated bone metrics.









Abstract
The use of piezoelectric materials to convert micromechanical energy at the fracture site into electrical signals, thereby modulating stress&#8208;concentrated inflammation, has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for diabetic fractures. However, traditional bone&#8208;guiding membranes often face challenges in diabetic fracture repair due to their passive and imprecise drug release profiles. Herein, a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibrous membrane is fabricated through electrospinning and oxidative polymerization to load metformin (Met) into a polypyrrole (PPy) coating (Met&#8208;PF@PPy), creating a &#8220;mechanical&#8208;electrical&#8208;pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system. In a micromotion mechanical environment, Met&#8208;PF@PPy converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, activating the electrochemical reduction of PPy and triggering stress&#8208;responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation through M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage polarization and simultaneously enhance osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway to reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In a diabetic mouse femoral fracture model, Met&#8208;PF@PPy significantly reduces inflammatory markers, enhances vascularization, and increases bone mineral density and bone volume fraction by over 30%. This &#8220;force&#8208;electric&#8208;drug coupling&#8221; strategy provides an innovative approach for active regulation in diabetic fracture repair and offers a versatile platform for advancing piezoelectric materials in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Li2ZrO3: A New Choice for Boosting Homogenous Distribution and Transport of Lithium Ion in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;vacancy lithium zirconate (O&#8208;LZO) reduces the bonding between lithium ion (Li+) and anions in lithium salts, promoting dissociation and increasing the concentration of free Li+. Kinetic simulations confirm the excellent intrinsic Li+ diffusion capability of O&#8208;LZO. As an active filler, O&#8208;LZO broadens Li+ transport pathways and enhances the dissociation and distribution of lithium salts, improving overall electrolyte performance.








Abstract
The low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid&#8208;state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)&#8208;vacancies (O&#8208;LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs (PEO@O&#8208;LZO). The O&#8208;LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O&#8208;vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O&#8208;vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O&#8208;LZO at 40&#160;&#176;C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O&#8208;LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40&#160;&#176;C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency. This work provides a design principle of fillers to regulate Li+ concentration and distribution in CPEs for efficient solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Highly Tunable Relaxors Developed from Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relaxor materials developed from the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO3 show a more complex phase transition and unconventional multi&#8208;phase competition compared with traditional relaxors developed from typical ferroelectrics, achieving ultrahigh dielectric response and tunability that can be sustained in the radio&#8208;frequency range, underscoring a promising approach to develop relaxors with enhanced functional capabilities and new possibilities.








Abstract
Highly responsive, voltage&#8208;tunable dielectrics are essential for microwave&#8208;telecommunication electronics. Ferroelectric/relaxor materials have been leading candidates for such functionality and have exhibited agile dielectric responses. Here, it is demonstrated that relaxor materials developed from antiferroelectrics can achieve both ultrahigh dielectric response and tunability. The system, based on alloying the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO3 with the dielectric BaZrO3, exhibits a more complex phase evolution than that in traditional relaxors and is characterized by an unconventional multi&#8208;phase competition between antiferroelectric, ferroelectric, and paraelectric order. This interplay of phases can greatly enhance the local heterogeneities and results in relaxor characteristics while preserving considerable polarizability. Upon studying Pb1&#8208;xBaxZrO3 for x = 0&#8208;0.45, Pb0.65Ba0.35ZrO3 is found to provide for exceptional dielectric tunability under low bias fields (&#8776;81% at 200&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and &#8776;91% at 500&#160;kV cm&#8722;1) at 10&#160;kHz, outcompeting most traditional relaxor ferroelectric films. This high tunability is sustained in the radio&#8208;frequency range, resulting in a high commutation quality factor (&gt;2000 at 1&#160;GHz). This work highlights the phase evolution from antiferroelectrics (with lower, &#8220;positive&#8221; dielectric tunability) to relaxors (with higher, &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability), underscoring a promising approach to develop relaxors with enhanced functional capabilities and new possibilities.

         <title>Semipermeable Membrane&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Bonding Interface for Fabricating High&#8208;Performance Pure PEDOT:PSS Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive flexible pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogel is developed inspired by the control of hierarchical phase separation, which is driven by the formation of dialysis&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interaction interface. The obtained hydrogel enables multi&#8208;scenario bioelectronic applications, including neural signals monitoring/stimulation within epileptic rats, human&#8208;machine interactions, and multimodal signal decoupling.








Abstract
Conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels are potential bioelectronic interface materials because of their favorable mechanical properties and tunable electrochemical performances. Owing to intrinsic core&#8208;shell colloidal microstructure composed of insulative phase and conductive phase, inducing phase separation via diverse methods are proposed to improve their performances. However, fabrication of high&#8208;performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via a simple, mild strategy remains challenges. Here, we report a straightforward strategy to yield high&#8208;performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via the formation of semipermeable membrane&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interface. In this method, ethanol&#8208;attracted PSS is free to accumulate at the man&#8208;made interface provided by the semipermeable membrane, to realize controllable hierarchical PEDOT and PSS two&#8208;phase distribution. The separated PEDOT aggregates via &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, followed by the removal of rearranged insulative PSS phase easily, to form PEDOT:PSS hydrogels with satisfactory mechanical and electrochemical performances. This work presents a universal, effective, and controlled strategy to design conductive hydrogels for bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Interface Field&#8208;Effect Passivation Enabled by Selectively Extruded Cations for Printable Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;effect passivation is achieved by selectively extruded tetraphenylphosphonium cations for suppressing the interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, yielding an improved power conversion efficiency of 21.0% for hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Mesoporous electron transport layer (ETL) in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) enables rapid and selective extraction of photogenerated electrons and facilitates device fabrication without a hole transport layer (HTL). However, the inherent mesoporous architecture introduces abundant interfacial defects that promote undesired non&#8208;radiative recombination, limiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE). To address this challenge, an interface field&#8208;effect passivation strategy is implemented, leveraging spatially selective cation extrusion. By incorporating tetraphenylphosphonium cations, sterically bulky organic ions that migrate to the perovskite/ETL interface during crystallization, a robust interfacial electrostatic field is introduced. This field simultaneously suppresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination by inducing field&#8208;effect passivation and enhances the charge extraction through optimizing energy alignment. The synergistic effects yield a PCE enhancement from 19.4% to 21.0%. This work underscores the potential of cation&#8208;engineered interfacial fields to improve the performance of HTL&#8208;free carbon&#8208;electrode perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Multifunctional Hydrogel Sensors Enabled Sustainable and Accurate Human&#8208;Machine Interaction System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Moreover, intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real&#8208;time remote controlling.








Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled by conductive hydrogels exhibit great application potential for their seamless integration with the human body for human&#8208;machine interactions (HMI). However, most multifunctional hydrogel sensors are prone to water loss and become useless e&#8208;waste, resulting in a growing threat to the global environment and human health. Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Meanwhile, RMSHS possesses admirable biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial ability (S. aureus and E. coli bacterial inhibition rate of 99.8%), rapid self&#8208;healing ability, and outstanding sensing performances such as low detection limit, fast response/recovery time (160/200&#160;ms). Intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real&#8208;time remote controlling. Moreover, the recyclable triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) intelligent array, designed based on RMSHS, replaces the electrode consumables in traditional TENGs, realizing the generation of green energy and 100% recyclability of electrode materials. RMSHS can be generalized and applied to other remote&#8208;controlling platforms, paving the way for large&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;scenario applications.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Ion Interactions Creating Dual&#8208;Nanoconfined Channels for Superior Mixed Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework membranes featuring abundant acidic groups and matching channel size are constructed. The strong membrane&#8208;ion interactions between the acidic sites and multivalent cations create a dual&#8208;nanoconfinement effect within rigid channels. This mechanism accelerates monovalent ions transport while hindering multivalent ions, enabling superior mixed ion separations.








Abstract
Ion transport in environments with mixed ions is crucial for numerous real&#8208;world applications. However, most membranes suffer from reduced selectivity in the mixed ion environment. Herein, the concept of dual&#8208;nanoconfined channels in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated for superior mixed mono&#8208;/multivalent ion separation. By incorporating acidic functionalities into the pore wall and coupling with a suitable pore size in the COF membranes, multivalent ions interact strongly with the acidic groups. This shields the interactions of the wall with monovalent ions, leaves sufficient space for fast monovalent ion passage, and in the meantime blocks multivalent ions, creating well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;nanoconfinement for mixed ion separation. Consequently, mixed Li+/Mg2+ ion selectivity exceeding 1,300 and mono&#8208;/trivalent ion selectivity over 9,000 is achieved. Molecular dynamics simulation and experiment with multiple ion pairs further confirm the mechanisms. The study sheds light on a fundamentally new design principle for mixed ion separation, offering the potential to reach remarkable selectivity in practical applications.

         <title>Large Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque with Multi&#8208;Directional Spin Components in Ni4W</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni4W is theoretically proposed and experimentally verified as a promising unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) material for generating multi&#8208;directional spins. Epitaxial Ni4W thin films with outstanding crystallinity are grown by magnetron sputtering. Multi&#8208;directional spins are observed by harmonic Hall measurements, and the conventional SOT efficiency is evaluated to be 0.73, marking the largest value reported for unconventional SOT materials to date.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) offers an efficient mechanism for manipulating the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials in spintronics&#8208;based memory and logic devices. However, conventional SOT materials, such as heavy metals and topological insulators, are limited by high crystal symmetry to generating and injecting only in&#8208;plane spins into the ferromagnet. Low&#8208;symmetry materials and symmetry&#8208;breaking strategies have been employed to generate unconventional spin currents with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization, enabling field&#8208;free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Despite this progress, the SOT efficiency of these materials has typically remained low. Here, a large SOT efficiency of 0.3 in the bulk Ni4W at room temperature is reported, as evaluated by second harmonic Hall measurements. In addition, due to the low crystal symmetry of Ni4W, unconventional SOT from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and Dresselhaus&#8208;like spin components are observed. Notably, a large SOT efficiency of 0.73 is observed in W/Ni4W (5&#160;nm), potentially resulting from additional interfacial contributions or extrinsic effects.

&lt;p&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W is theoretically proposed and experimentally verified as a promising unconventional spin-orbit torque (SOT) material for generating multi-directional spins. Epitaxial Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W thin films with outstanding crystallinity are grown by magnetron sputtering. Multi-directional spins are observed by harmonic Hall measurements, and the conventional SOT efficiency is evaluated to be 0.73, marking the largest value reported for unconventional SOT materials to date.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-orbit torque (SOT) offers an efficient mechanism for manipulating the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials in spintronics-based memory and logic devices. However, conventional SOT materials, such as heavy metals and topological insulators, are limited by high crystal symmetry to generating and injecting only in-plane spins into the ferromagnet. Low-symmetry materials and symmetry-breaking strategies have been employed to generate unconventional spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization, enabling field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Despite this progress, the SOT efficiency of these materials has typically remained low. Here, a large SOT efficiency of 0.3 in the bulk Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W at room temperature is reported, as evaluated by second harmonic Hall measurements. In addition, due to the low crystal symmetry of Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W, unconventional SOT from the out-of-plane and Dresselhaus-like spin components are observed. Notably, a large SOT efficiency of 0.73 is observed in W/Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W (5&#160;nm), potentially resulting from additional interfacial contributions or extrinsic effects. Furthermore, field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been achieved using the multi-directional SOT of Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W, highlighting its potential as a low-symmetry SOT material for energy-efficient spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bionic Textile Sensory System for Humanoid Robots Capable of Intelligent Texture Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is designed and fabricated by mimicking slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors. The PT sensor realizes the function of both SA and FA receptors based on a piezoresistive principle in a single sensor, and an artificial sensory system is constructed for real&#8208;time high&#8208;accuracy surface texture recognition.








Abstract
Artificial tactile perception systems that emulate the functions of slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors are essential for developing advanced prosthetics and humanoid robots. However, constructing a high&#8208;performance sensory system within a single device capable of simultaneously perceiving both static and dynamic forces for surface&#8208;texture recognition remains a critical challenge; this contrasts with common strategies integrating individual SA&#8208; and FA&#8208;mimicking sensors in multi&#8208;layered, multi&#8208;circuit configurations. Herein, a textile pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is reported based solely on piezoresistive principle alongside high sensitivity and rapid response to both high&#8208;frequency vibrations and static forces. These characteristics are attributed to the sensor's 3D multiscale architecture and the corresponding hierarchical structural deformation of its honeycomb&#8208;like sensing fabric. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application relevant to humanoid robotics and prosthetics, an automated surface&#8208;texture&#8208;recognition system is constructed by integrating the PT sensor with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, a prosthetic device, an industrial robot arm, and a graphical user interface. This artificial sensory system demonstrates the ability to learn distinct object features, differentiate fine surface textures, and subsequently classify unknown textiles with high recognition accuracy (&gt;98.9%) across a wide range of scanning speeds (50&#8211;300&#160;mm s&#8722;1). These results show promise for the future development of interactive artificial intelligence.

         <title>Minimizing Inter&#8208;Lattice Strain to Stabilize Li&#8208;Rich Cathode by Order&#8211;Disorder Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An order&#8211;disorder coherent design in Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered cathode enables homogeneous structural evolution during charge&#8211;discharge, minimizing lattice strain and suppressing structural degradation, leading to enhanced cycling stability with negligible voltage decay.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered (LMR) cathodes with anionic redox chemistry show great potential for next&#8208;generation sustainable Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) applications due to the low cost and high energy density. However, the asynchronous structural evolutions with cycling in the heterogeneous composite structure of LMR lead to serious lattice strain and thus fast electrochemical decay, which hinders the commercialization of LMR cathodes. Here, an order&#8211;disorder coherent LMR cathode is demonstrated that exhibits a higher average voltage (by 0.25&#160;V), negligible voltage decay (97.6% voltage retention after 100 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and enhanced cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) compared to its layered oxide counterparts. It is proposed that this order&#8211;disorder coherent structure design can promote a more synchronous and homogeneous structure evolution during charge and discharge, thus minimizing lattice strain, which significantly prevents layer collapse and collective degradation at high voltage, improving the electrochemical stability. The study displays the feasibility of optimizing the performance of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials through a dedicated order&#8211;disorder structure control for sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Level and Air&#8208;Stable Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8211;inorganic material with air&#8208;stable organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 20 h is obtained by immobilizing organic guests within inorganic B2O3&#8208;containing traps through hydrogen bonding. The charge carriers trapped/released by traps play an important role in the OLPL.









Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials show important application prospects in bioimaging due to their low biotoxicity and the ability to eliminate the interference of background fluorescence. However, OLPL materials suffer from poor environmental stability and short afterglow times. Herein, by introducing the phosphorescent guest 2, 3&#8208;naphthalimide (NAI) into the B2O3 (BO) matrix using a solvent&#8208;free method in an air atmosphere, an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material NAI/BO is obtained, exhibiting OLPL lasting for more than 20&#160;h, visible to the naked eye for up to 180&#160;min. Photoluminescence and thermoluminescence spectra reveal that the OLPL originates from pure phosphorescence of NAI, and is induced by inorganic defects generated by oxygen vacancies in BO. The NAI electrons in the excited state can be captured by the defect, then detrapped through the thermal activation process, and eventually returned to the triplet state of NAI, thereby achieving OLPL emission. NAI/BO is successfully applied in vivo imaging stimulated in vitro. In addition, the universality of this strategy is verified by changing the phosphorescent guest molecules, enabling the regulation of OLPL from green to orange&#8211;red light. These results provide an important foundation for the design and development of stable OLPL materials and the practical applications in biological imaging.

         <title>Edge States in 2D A2PbBr4 Hybrid Perovskites Enabled by Local Structural Reorganization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;energy edge states in two&#8208;dimensional hybrid lead halide perovskites are driven by Rashba/Dresselhaus spin splitting, resulting from local structural distortions at the crystal edges. Strained PbBr6 octahedra cause out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortions, breaking inversion symmetry and enabling spin splitting. These edge states with enhanced charge dynamics facilitate efficient light emission and could improve device performance in spintronic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The edge states (ES) in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) exhibit distinct electronic characteristics, including lower energy and longer lifetimes compared to the interior states (IS). Though the ES of these 2D LHPs show prospect of facilitating photovoltaic and optoelectronic effects, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, the occurrence of ES in a family of 2D A2PbBr4 (A = organic amine cation) LHPs is attributed to the Rashba/Dresselhaus (RD) spin splitting induced&#160;by local structural reorganization on the crystal edge. The experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal that the local structure on the crystal edge is significantly strained, which leads to considerable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of adjacent PbBr6 octahedra, local loss of inversion symmetry and therefore spin&#8208;splitting energy required for the formation of ES. This findings contribute fresh perspectives to the fundamental comprehension of the RD effect, extending the boundaries of spintronics and opening promising pathways for the conceptualization and refinement of devices centered on ES.

This findings contribute fresh perspectives to the fundamental comprehension of the RD effect, extending the boundaries of spintronics and opening promising pathways for the conceptualization and refinement of devices centered on ES.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Magnetoelectric Generation of miRNA Sponges and Wireless Electric Stimulus by Conductive Granular Scaffolds for Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive granular scaffold (cGRAS) is developed to enable wireless electrical stimulation and targeted miRNA modulation for traumatic brain injury (TBI) repair. Acting as both an antenna and a gene delivery platform, cGRAS facilitates miRNA sponge formation and neuronal regeneration via AMF&#8208;triggered electroporation and mechanotransduction, leading to reduced inflammation, enhanced angiogenesis, and improved functional recovery.








Abstract
Electronic signaling and microRNA (miRNA) regulation play pivotal roles in determining neuronal cell fate and promoting brain recovery. Despite this, clinical advancements are hindered by the limited availability of tools for spatiotemporal electrical signaling and non&#8208;viral gene modulation in neurons in vivo. In this study, a conductive granular scaffold (cGRAS) that doubles as an antenna and neuronal gene delivery agent for targeted miRNA regulation of nerve repair in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is developed. The inherent features of granular scaffolds reduce the inflammation and glial scarring in TBI by mitigating activated microglia and stellate cells. Upon irradiation with an external alternating magnetic field (AMF), the &#8220;electromagnetic messenger&#8221; induces electrical stimulation to restore brain function and promotes temporal electroporation. This process, together with mechanotransduction capability of cGRAS, enhances the delivery and formation of miRNA sponges both in vitro and in vivo, thereby reducing the overexpression of miR6263, which is significantly upregulated upon neuronal injury. In the whole brain imaging analysis, suppression of inflammation, angiogenesis around the TBI cavity, and infiltration of newborn neurons in the injured area are observed after in situ magnetoelectric formation of miRNA sponges and wireless electric stimulus, leading to improved brain function and behavioral recovery. Overall, this cGRAS represents a potentially innovative and versatile tool for clinical neuronal regeneration engineering.

         <title>Discovering Stable Amorphous Ceramics: From Computational Prediction to Thin&#8208;Film Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a computationally guided approach to discovering stable amorphous ceramics, using yttrium tungsten nitride (Y&#8208;W&#8208;N) as a prototype. By combining first&#8208;principles random structure sampling with thin&#8208;film synthesis, the authors identify and experimentally realize previously unreported amorphous nitrides, demonstrating their exceptional thermal stability, tunable properties, and superior diffusion barrier performance.








Abstract
Amorphous materials offer unique functional characteristics, which are not observed in their crystalline counterparts making them invaluable for many applications in science and technology, such as electronic and optical devices, solid&#8208;state batteries, and protective coatings. However, finding compositions that are stable against crystallization and/or phase separation, and at the same time offer the needed functionality in the amorphous phase is still largely done by serendipity or trial&#8208;and&#8208;error. In this work, using yttrium tungsten nitride as a prototype, it is shown how computational random structure sampling provides a robust method to identify compositions that exhibit a highly corrugated potential energy surface with many narrow local minima, which are consequently hard to crystallize and remain stable in the amorphous phase. Synthesis experiments prove that the predicted nitride is readily synthesized in an amorphous phase with no detectable precipitates. High&#8208;throughput and conventional characterization of structural, physical, and functional properties of the discovered amorphous nitride compound reveal its attractive properties and possible application potential. The proposed workflow combining theory and experiment is broadly applicable to the discovery of a wide range of amorphous ceramic materials, paving the way for advanced amorphous materials for diverse emerging technologies.

         <title>Polyanhydride&#8208;Based Microparticles for Programmable Pulsatile Release of Diphtheria Toxoid (DT) for Single&#8208;Injection Self&#8208;Boosting Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a polyanhydride&#8208;based delivery platform for single&#8208;injection, self&#8208;boosting vaccines. The system enables programmable, pulsatile release of diphtheria toxoid with high antigen recovery and is guided by machine learning for tunability. In vivo results show immune responses comparable to multi&#8208;dose regimens, highlighting its potential to improve vaccine accessibility and reduce under&#8208;immunization.








Abstract
Vaccination remains a critical tool in preventing infectious diseases, yet its effectiveness is undermined by under&#8208;immunization, particularly for vaccines requiring multiple doses that patients fail to complete. To address this challenge, the development of single&#8208;injection platforms delivering self&#8208;boosting vaccines has gained significant attention. Despite some advances, translating these platforms into clinical applications has been limited. In this study, a novel polyanhydride&#8208;based polymeric delivery platform is introduced, designed for single&#8208;injection self&#8208;boosting vaccines, replacing multiple doses. Over 20 polyanhydride polymers are synthesized and screened, ultimately down selecting to 6 for in vitro studies, and 2 for in vivo studies. Using diphtheria toxoid (DT) as a model antigen, programmed pulsatile release with a narrow window is demonstrated, ideal for self&#8208;boosting immunization. The platform effectively protects the pH&#8208;sensitive antigen before release, achieving recovery rate of 39.7% to 89.7%. The system's tunability is further enhanced by machine learning algorithms, which accurately predict release profiles, confirmed through experimental validation. In vivo studies in a mouse model reveals that the platform induces DT&#8208;specific antibody responses comparable to those generated by traditional multi&#8208;dose regimens. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of this platform to deliver various vaccines, offering a potentially promising solution to the global challenge of under&#8208;immunization.

         <title>Conductance Reinforced Relaxation Attenuation with Strong Metal&#8208;N Coordination in Multivariate &#960;&#8208;Conjugated MOFs for Integrated Radar&#8208;Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work leverages a conductance&#8208;reinforced attenuation mechanism via enhanced Metal&#8208;N coordination to boost electron mobility and optimize electromagnetic response. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated MOFs are 3D&#8208;printed into a stealth drone propeller that achieves both radar and infrared stealth.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, owning to their high conductivity and versatile structural tunability. Nevertheless, the effective control over their dielectric properties is a challenge. Herein, the charge carrier migration in &#960;&#8208;conjugated MOFs is harnessed to significantly amplify the electromagnetic response, where the strengthened atom coordination can activate a distinctive conductance&#8208;reinforced attenuation mechanism. This results in finely calibrated EMW absorption characteristics, including a wide effective absorption bandwidth of 6.0 GHz at mere 2 mm, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;46.7 dB at 3.5 mm, and a substantial reduction in radar cross&#8208;section (RCS) up to &#8722;23.3 dBm2. Furthermore, the seamless integration of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated MOF hybrids within ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;curable 3D printing technology has enabled the fabrication of a stealth&#8208;enabled drone propeller prototype, which exhibits a remarkably low infrared emissivity of 0.205. Additionally, when the propeller device is subjected to a 100 &#176;C heating platform for 30 min, its surface temperature remains below 50 &#176;C, demonstrating exceptional thermal management and stability under elevated temperature conditions. This work underscores the immense potential of these cutting&#8208;edge absorbers to shape the future of advanced military stealth technologies.

         <title>Optimizing Printed Quasi&#8208;2D Luminescent Perovskite Films via Delaminated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ heterogeneous nucleation strategy for quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films via microelectronic printing is demonstrated, employing delaminated Cd&#8208;MOF as modulators. The layered Cd&#8208;MOF framework facilitates controlled nucleation, regulates phase distribution, and promotes stress relaxation, yielding films with an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield and enhanced stability. These advancements underscore the potential of MOF&#8208;assisted synthesis in advancing high&#8208;performance perovskite materials for optoelectronics.








Abstract
Microelectronic printing technology has recently emerged as a key approach in advancing pixel&#8208;array perovskite films, particularly quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films, to meet current scientific and technological demands. However, its further development remains hindered by the uncontrollable crystallization of perovskite during the printing process. Herein, a novel in situ heterogeneous nucleation growth approach for obtaining quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films is demonstrated, utilizing delaminated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (i.e., layered Cd&#8208;MOF) with an ordered structure as modulators. The inosculation of phenylethylammonium (PEA+) with layered Cd&#8208;MOF serves as crystal nuclei, facilitating heterogeneous crystal nucleation and growth while regulating the distribution of the n&#8208;phase. Moreover, the intercalation of the layered Cd&#8208;MOF alleviates rigid stress, thereby eliminating defects in the printed films. The resulting quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films exhibit an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 37.40% along with exceptional luminescent stability, making them promising candidates for various optoelectronic applications. Overall, this study highlights the significant potential of MOF&#8208;assisted synthesis in advancing high&#8208;performance perovskite materials through microelectronic printing technology, offering a promising pathway for the development of future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Mannosylated MOF Encapsulated in Lactobacillus Biofilm for Dual&#8208;Targeting Intervention Against Mammalian Escherichia coli Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a dual&#8208;targeting nano&#8208;system (Zn&#8208;MOF@Man/LRB) against Escherichia coli infection. Mannosylated Zn&#8208;MOF aggregates bacteria via FimH recognition and disrupts biofilms, while Lactobacillus biofilm encapsulation enables gut&#8208;targeted immunomodulation and sustains nanomaterial release. The system restores microbiota equilibrium and promotes stem cell differentiation and barrier stability. This approach demonstrates cross&#8208;species anti&#8208;diarrheal efficacy, advancing safe and effective treatment that restores intestinal homeostasis for potential applications in both human medicine and animal husbandry.








Abstract
Pathogenic bacterial infections pose a major concern, especially concerning mammalian enteritis and diarrhea. Compared to conventional antibiotic intervention, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit superior antibacterial properties and lower&#160;cytotoxicity, demonstrating great promise in the treatment of pathogen&#8208;induced diarrhea. However, the achievement of their precise targeted delivery is still a significant challenge. Herein, a novel precision nano&#8208;system with a dual&#8208;targeting approach for treating intestinal infections caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) is designed. First, Zn&#8208;MOF was synthesized based on ZnO, which possessed enhanced elimination of planktonic bacteria and biofilms. Through mannosylation, Zn&#8208;MOF@Man specifically recognized the FimH pili of E. coli, leading to its aggregation and subsequent eradication. Second, guided by whole genome sequencing, the encapsulation of Lactobacillus biofilm exertd immunomodulatory function, overcomed challenges related to intestinal targeting, and facilitated sustained drug release. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;MOF@Man/LRB maintaind microbiota equilibrium and promoted stem cell differentiation and barrier stability, ensuring consistent anti&#8208;diarrheal and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy in mice, piglets, and humans. This approach represents a novel dual&#8208;targeting antimicrobial strategy, combining probiotic biofilms and E. coli&#8208;oriented delivery, advancing safe and effective treatment that restores intestinal homeostasis for potential applications in both human medicine and animal husbandry.

         <title>Efficient Red Perovskite LEDs with Iodine Management via Volatile Additive I2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental iodine (I2) is used to create an iodine&#8208;rich environment for inhibiting the formation of iodine vacancy defects. This strategy also modifies the perovskite's surface energy, regulating its crystallization kinetics and resulting in a more well&#8208;crystallized perovskite with a preferred (001)&#8208;orientation. Consequently, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% for deep&#8208;red (678 nm) and 29.5% for pure&#8208;red (649 nm) have been achieved.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face a tough challenge that halogen vacancy defects limit device performance, while the introduction of additional agents to passivate defects may potentially compromise the stability of the structure and increase the complexity of the system. Here, elemental iodine (I2) is employed as an additive, utilizing its ability to create an iodine&#8208;rich condition and to transform into I&#8722; ions for passivating iodine vacancy defects, while its volatile nature ensures no residue and avoids the introduction of extraneous elements. This approach also alters the perovskite's surface energy and subsequently regulates its crystallization kinetics, which results in a more well&#8208;crystallized perovskite with vertically&#8208;aligned organic spacer layers, in turn promoting the transport of charge carriers. On the basis of this strategy, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% and 29.5% for deep&#8208;red (678 nm) and pure&#8208;red (649 nm) have been achieved, respectively.

         <title>Nonlinear Conductive Graphene Composites for Pressure Sensing with a Linear Response and Voltage&#8208;Driven Thermal Correction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear conductive graphene composite (NcGc) layer, incorporating a conductive laser&#8208;reduced graphene oxide layer, is assembled into flexible pressure sensors without microstructural designs, achieving high sensitivity (742.3 kPa&#8722;1) and a wide linear sensing range (&gt;800&#160;kPa). The nonlinear conductivity of the NcGc layer enables bias&#8208;tunable sensitivity, inherently correcting thermal drifts and thereby preserving the precision of robotic gripper manipulation across varying temperatures.








Abstract
Thermal fluctuations pose a significant challenge to the signal stability of nanomaterial&#8208;based piezoresistive pressure sensors, limiting their effectiveness in applications such as electronic skin and robotics. Conventional temperature compensation strategies often rely on additional thermal sensors or complex calibration algorithms. Here, a flexible pressure sensor is reported featuring a nonlinear conductive graphene composite layer within a bilayer architecture, enabling bias voltage&#8208;controlled sensitivity without structural redesign. The sensor achieves ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (742.3 kPa&#8722;1), a broad linear sensing range of up to 800&#160;kPa (R2 = 0.99913), and excellent long&#8208;term durability over 10&#8201;000 cycles. Crucially, the unique nonlinear characteristics enable the bias voltage to function as an internal remote control for correcting temperature drifts between 25 and 60&#160;&#176;C, as demonstrated by precise manipulation in robotic grippers under varying temperature conditions. This work offers a universal strategy for building environmentally adaptive sensors, advancing the development of robust and high&#8208;precision wearable electronics.

         <dc:description>
This work presents a multi&#8208;site passivation strategy that uses Bis(2,5&#8208;dioxopyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diylbis(sulfanediyl)) diacetate (TK&#8208;NHS) as an interfacial modifier to address the substantial performance losses when scaling up perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to large&#8208;area perovskite solar modules (PSMs). The resulting PSCs achieved an outstanding power coversion efficiency (PCE)&#160;of 26.16%, demonstrating impressive scalability, while the corresponding PSMs achieved a remarkable PCE of 22.25%.

Here, a multi&#8208;site passivation strategy is reported by employing Bis(2,5&#8208;dioxopyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diylbis(sulfanediyl)) diacetate (TK&#8208;NHS) as an interfacial modifier to address the critical issues of interface recombination and stability in both PSCs and PSMs. TK&#8208;NHS effectively inactivates common defects, by modifying the surface of perovskite films through multi&#8208;site synergistical interactions. Additionally, a stable dipole layer formed at the interface optimizes energy level alignment, facilitating efficient electron extraction and transport. The resulting perovskite film exhibited a smoother and more homogeneous surface, thus improving interface contact and reducing nonradiative recombination. Consequently, TK&#8208;NHS&#8208;treated PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.16%, with significantly improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.188&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 85.3%. The scalable potential of this multi&#8208;site passivation strategy has been verified by corresponding PSMs, delivering an impressive PCE of 22.25%. Notably, the devices exhibited exceptional operational stability, retaining 91.4% and 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 and 800 h of continuous illumination, respectively. Thereby advancing the progress of the scaled&#8208;up production of PSCs to modules.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a multi-site passivation strategy that uses Bis(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) 2,2&#8242;-(propane-2,2-diylbis(sulfanediyl)) diacetate (TK-NHS) as an interfacial modifier to address the substantial performance losses when scaling up perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to large-area perovskite solar modules (PSMs). The resulting PSCs achieved an outstanding power coversion efficiency (PCE)&#160;of 26.16%, demonstrating impressive scalability, while the corresponding PSMs achieved a remarkable PCE of 22.25%.

         <title>Dynamic Switching Spin State of Fe Single Atoms for Piezoelectric&#8208;Mediated Overall Nitrogen Fixation Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an alternating piezoelectric field is introduced into Fe SAs anchored defective&#8208;BaTiO3 (OvBTO&#8208;Fe), and dynamic and bidirectional switching of spin&#8208;states can be realized to simultaneously facilitate ammonia and nitrate co&#8208;synthesis for achieving record ONF activity and energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven one&#8208;step disproportionation overall nitrogen fixation (ONF) for synchronously synthesizing ammonia and nitrate presents a promising alternative to conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch and Ostwald processes, but suffers from ultra&#8208;low efficiency. Single atoms (SAs) featured by maximized atomic utilization exhibit superb catalytic activity, while the definite electronic configurations confine SAs to function solely as reduction or oxidation sites, limiting the possibility for both reduction and oxidation reactions. Herein, an efficient approach is presented for ammonia and nitrate co&#8208;synthesis by introducing Fe SAs and alternating piezoelectric field into a defective piezoelectric BaTiO3 (OvBTO&#8208;Fe), enabling the formation spatially&#8208;separated redox regions and dynamic bidirectional switching of Fe spin states. At positive and negative polarization ends, Fe spin state transitions to high and low spin states through d&#8208;electrons relocation, respectively, thermodynamically and kinetically facilitate nitrogen reduction and oxidation reactions. Thus, OvBTO&#8208;Fe exhibits unprecedented piezo&#8208;photocatalytic ONF activity, achieving a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.82% and total energy&#8208;to&#8208;chemical&#160;conversion efficiency of 0.53%. This work proposes a methodology for dynamic multi&#8208;directional manipulation of spin states and overall catalytic synthesis reaction.

         <title>Bionic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Activates the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; Cascade Effect In Situ to Accelerate Critical&#8208;Sized Bone Defect Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bionic PPCs&#8208;TENG accelerates CSBD repair through the activation of a &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect. It generates bio&#8208;ES that dynamically responds to the host's mechanical state, exhibiting a resting membrane potential during static conditions and generating action potentials upon mechanical deformation. This bio&#8208;ES activates both extracellular and intracellular biochemical factors, leading to enhanced osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic processes in CSBDs.








Abstract
The loss of the intrinsic &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect in critical&#8208;sized bone defects (CSBDs) impedes the bone self&#8208;healing process. Traditional strategies cannot provide bionic electrical output, thereby failing to sufficiently activate the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect in situ and limiting the repair efficiency of CSBDs. Here, a bionic, self&#8208;adhesive, and biodegradable triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) called PPCs&#8208;TENG using silk&#8208;fibroin&#8208;derived peptide (Cs)&#8208;grafted polydopamine&#8211;polyacrylamide (PPCs) as the electrode layer is fabricated. It provides bionic electrical stimulation (bio&#8208;ES) in response to the host's motion status. It reestablishes the resting potential during host rest and generates real&#8208;time biofeedback action potential during host movement. Further, it activates the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect for accelerating the repair of CSBDs. The bio&#8208;ES generated from PPCs&#8208;TENG enriches extracellular osteogenesis&#8208;related biochemical factors at the CSBD site. It also activates the intracellular mechanosensitive protein Piezo1, thereby promoting calcium signaling and intracellular mechano&#8208;transduction pathways. This activation enhances the proliferation and migration of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and promotes osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs and angiogenesis in HUVECs. In vivo tests demonstrate that PPCs&#8208;TENG significantly accelerates the repair of CSBDs in situ.

         <title>Building Unit Engineering Toward COF Membranes with Controlled Stacking for H2 Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework nanosheets are engineered via ternary monomer design to achieve programmable interlayer offsets. Non&#8208;planar alkyl&#8208;functionalized monomers induce interlayer torsion, transitioning AA to AA' and AB stacking for angstrom&#8208;precise pore tuning. The mechanically robust, blade&#8208;cast membranes exhibit exceptional H&#8322;/CO&#8322; selectivity up to 60 in gas mixtures from methanol&#8208;reforming.








Abstract
Hydrogen purification by membrane technology offers a sustainable path to meet the escalating demands of green energy. However, conventional polymeric membranes are constrained by permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off and instability under real&#8208;world operating conditions. While covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold promise, their overlarge pores and poor film&#8208;processibility are to be imperatively solved. Herein, a ternary building unit system is designed for synthesizing imine&#8208;based COF nanosheets with programmable interlayer offsets. By synergizing a planar aldehyde monomer as the basic structural unit and a none&#8208;planar alkyl&#8208;functionalized aldehyde monomer as the structure regulation unit, we induce layer distortion that disrupts &#960;&#8211;&#960; dominated AA stacking, enabling angstrom&#8208;precise pore tuning (1.4&#8211;0.6&#160;nm) via controlled transitions to AB stacking while retaining crystallinity. The mechanically robust nanosheets are easily assembled into large&#8208;area membranes via a facile blade casting, overcoming the processability bottleneck associated with binary building unit systems. The resulting membranes demonstrate an exceptional H2/CO2 selectivity of 60, surpassing existing benchmarks. When treating gas mixtures from methanol steam reforming, a two&#8208;stage membrane process achieves 99.5% H2 purity and 94.0% recovery. Precise modulation of pore architecture and mechanical flexibility through building units engineered stacking affords a platform for microporous organic membranes.

         <title>Cyanobenzene&#8208;Modified Quinoxaline&#8208;Based Acceptors with Optimal Excitonic Behavior Enable Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are synthesized by regulating central&#8208;core cyanobenzene substitution for the first time. The asymmetric substitution increases the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells to 20.16%. The corresponding device exhibits higher thermal stability and better excitonic behavior, providing important insights for the design of SMAs.








Abstract
Cyanogroup (&#8208;CN) is a strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing and highly polar functional group; therefore, cyanation has been extensively utilized to optimize the terminal groups of high&#8208;performance small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN&#8208;F, phCN&#8208;Cl, 2phCN&#8208;F, and 2phCN&#8208;Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN&#8208;F&#8208;based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN&#8208;F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85&#176;C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This study elucidates the potential mechanisms for optimizing device performance through asymmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution of the central core, providing valuable insights for the further design of record&#8208;breaking SMAs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photoactive Ferroelectric Semiconductor Incorporating Aromatic Dynamic Spacer Enables Optoelectronic Synaptic Plasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;pendulum&#8208;like&#8221; motions of aromatic cations are customized in the 2D constrained environments to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics with unique photo&#8208;ferroelectric coupling effects, which enables the construction of heterojunction phototransistors with superior optoelectronic synaptic plasticity.








Abstract
Photoferroelectrics are capturing the growing interest for their unique light&#8208;polarization coupling and optoelectronic applicability. However, the formidable challenge persists in coupling electric order and strong photoactivity through precise molecular design, hindering their further application in the field of optoelectronic memory. Herein, the molecular dynamics of aromatic cations in the 2D constrained environments are customized to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics, (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium)2(ethylammonium)2Pb3I10, showing a narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.96&#160;eV) and strong visible&#8208;photosensitivity. Notably, multi&#8208;level dynamic states of aromatic cations provide the impetus for inducing ferroelectric order and photo&#8208;ferroelectric effects. Such captivating characteristics can achieve light&#8208;induced multiple polarization, dielectric, and conductivity states. Accordingly, photoferroelectrics are integrated into heterojunction phototransistors that display robust electrical and optical modulation, including diversified synaptic plasticity with low optical program power (&#8776;20 pJ) for each training process. As a noteworthy advancement in the photoferroelectric field, this work will enrich the understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and shed light on further exploration toward neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Highly Repeatable and Cyclically Stable Mechanoluminescence of the Flexible Composite Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a solid&#8208;solution strategy to modulate the mechanoluminescence of the composite elastomer with the physical principles proposed. With no need for power supply and circuit design, the developed CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer yields bright and repeatable light for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions, significantly breaking the performance limitations of the existing materials.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) elastomer shows tremendous potential for the next generation of flexible displaying, imaging, and sensing devices. However, inadequate repeatability and cyclic stability are the current bottlenecks. In this work, a solid&#8208;solution strategy is reported to regulate the interfacial interactions of ML elastomer, in which the (Ca,Ba)5(PO4)3Cl:Eu solid solutions and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are employed, respectively. The results suggest that the solid&#8208;solution strategy can effectively modulate the energy position of the valence band and the charge density distributions of the lowest unoccupied band, as well as the interfacial triboelectrification. Consequently, the ML performance of the composite elastomer in terms of intensity, spectral characteristic, and repeatability has been significantly improved. Particularly, the optimum CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer exhibits stable and repeatable ML for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions. This work not only provides a highly repeatable and cyclically stable ML elastomer but also clarifies the intrinsic physical principles, showing high guiding significance for future ML design and applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes with Negligible Voltage Decay through Migration Retardation Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high entropy design effectively inhibits the structural degradation in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials during cycling, including the oxygen vacancy formation, volume expansion, and Mn coordination environment disordering, thus significantly improving the voltage retention and energy output. This migration retardation effect is attributed to the synergistic enhancement of covalency and ionicity, which makes Mn ion migration thermodynamically infeasible.








Abstract
The development of advanced Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LRO) is essential for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, LRO exhibits large voltage hysteresis and rapid voltage decay with irreversible TM migration upon prolonged cycling. Given that high&#8208;entropy oxides have expanded the potential for retarding the harmful phase transition and regulating the site energies, therefore a high&#8208;entropy Li1.17Mn0.50Ni0.12Co0.12Mg0.03Cu0.02Ti0.02Nb0.02O2 cathode is synthesized (HELRO) for LIBs in the present study, demonstrated significantly improved voltage retention and energy output. In addition, this work unveils the sluggish degradation of superlattice and local structure in HELRO during long charge&#8211;discharge cycles and explains the &#8220;migration retardation effect.&#8221; The higher configurational entropy contributes to the higher energy barriers for in&#8208;plane, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, and continuous Mn migrations due to the synergistic ionic&#8211;covalent enhancement of Mn&#9472;O bonds. This work provides new insights for understanding the improvement mechanisms of high entropy cathodes and demonstrates the feasibility of suppressing long&#8208;standing voltage decay by high entropy design combining covalent and ionic elements.

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Anion Regulation for High&#8208;Efficient Sn&#8208;Pb and All&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional dual&#8208;anion synergistic strategy that combines acetate anions (Ac&#8722;) from formamidinium acetate and thiocyanate anions (SCN&#8208;) from guanidinium thiocyanate to produce high&#8208;quality MA&#8208;free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite films via a simplified antisolvent&#8208;free spin&#8208;coating process. Ac&#8722; anions retard crystallization and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation through the formation of intermediate phases and anion exchange process, while SCN&#8208; anions further promote crystal growth and stabilize Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions, improving energy level alignment and grain boundary management.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are integral to all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs), offering significant potential to surpass the theoretical efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the rapid crystallization of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn2+ to oxidize into Sn4+ remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual&#8208;anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high&#8208;quality MA&#8208;free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent&#8208;free spin&#8208;coating process. Acetate anions (Ac&#8722;) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac&#8722; and thiocyanate anions (SCN&#8722;) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions. The dual&#8208;anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single&#8208;junction Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent. While all&#8208;perovskite TSCs reach 28.07% efficiency with remarkable operational stability, retaining 81% of initial performance after 600 h under maximum power point tracking.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional dual-anion synergistic strategy that combines acetate anions (Ac&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) from formamidinium acetate and thiocyanate anions (SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) from guanidinium thiocyanate to produce high-quality MA-free Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite films via a simplified antisolvent-free spin-coating process. Ac&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions retard crystallization and mitigate Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation through the formation of intermediate phases and anion exchange process, while SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anions further promote crystal growth and stabilize Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; via strong coordination interactions, improving energy level alignment and grain boundary management.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed tin-lead (Sn-Pb) perovskites are integral to all-perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs), offering significant potential to surpass the theoretical efficiency limits of single-junction solar cells. However, the rapid crystallization of Sn-Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to oxidize into Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual-anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high-quality MA-free Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent-free spin-coating process. Acetate anions (Ac&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and thiocyanate anions (SCN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; via strong coordination interactions. The dual-anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non-radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single-junction Sn-Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn-Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent. While all-perovskite TSCs reach 28.07% efficiency with remarkable operational stability, retaining 81% of initial performance after 600 h under maximum power point tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immobilization of Covalent Triazine Framework into Hydrogels for Photothermal&#8208;Promoted Gas&#8208;Solid Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel floatable hydrogen&#8208;freshwater cogeneration hybrid hydrogel featuring a dynamic gas&#8208;solid interface toward photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is reported. The synergy of photothermal materials and 3D nanostructured hydrogel on covalent triazine framework facilitates solar interfacial evaporation and enhanced hydrogen production, highlighting its great potential for scalable and sustainable solar energy utilization.








Abstract
Organic photocatalysts generally suffer from insufficient near&#8208;infrared light absorption and undesirable photogenerated charge transport properties, resulting in unfavorable hydrogen evolution performance from water splitting. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also known to be significantly influenced by the interfacial charge and mass transfer in a catalyst/H2O biphase system. Herein, for the first time, a highly stable and floating hydrogen&#8208;water cogeneration hybrid hydrogel that utilizes&#160;photothermal&#8208;induced interface microenvironment variation to accelerate sluggish photocatalytic water splitting reaction is reported. Supported by solar&#8208;powered interfacial evaporation and efficient vapor generation, the rationally designed hydrogel effectively transforms the conventional liquid&#8208;solid interface into a gas&#8208;solid photocatalytic interface. The presence of gas&#8208;liquid coexistence state offers a disordered and loose hydrogen&#8208;bond network while preserving the proton transfer channel, greatly reducing reaction activation energy and interfacial energy barriers. The improved heat and mass transfer together with optimized charge transfer pathways suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, the integrated photothermal&#8208;coupled solar photocatalytic hydrogel exhibits excellent operational stability and self&#8208;adaptive rotation in seawater, mitigating salt accumulation and achieving an exceptional vapor generation rate of 4.71&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and a hydrogen&#8208;evolving rate of 1961.25&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under one sun illumination.

         <title>P&#8208;Band Center Engineering of Sulfur to Weaken Fe&#9472;S Bond Toward Superior Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique v&#8208;FeS2@C composite is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift p&#8208;band center (&#603;p) of S, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The v&#8208;FeS2@C anode exhibits record&#8208;breaking rate capability and long&#8208;life cycle performance. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell delivers the best specific capacity and long cyclic stability, much more superior to that of the other iron&#8208;based sulfides.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based sulfides are appealing anodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the high theoretical capacity, low&#8208;cost, and excellent mechanical/thermal stability. However, achieving high electrochemical performances in such anodes is hindered by the strong Fe&#9472;S bonds and sluggish kinetics. Here, a unique carbon&#8208;coated iron sulfide composite with abundant S vacancies (v&#8208;FeS2@C) is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift the p&#8208;band center (&#603;
p) of S and then decouple it from the d&#8208;band center (&#603;d) of Fe, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The obtained v&#8208;FeS2@C anode exhibits ultrahigh rate capability of 438.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 70 A g&#8722;1 and remarkable long&#8208;life cycle performance (512.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 8000 cycles at 40 A g&#8722;1). Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of v&#8208;FeS2@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode delivers the best specific capacity (211.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 40 A g&#8722;1) and long cyclic stability (459.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Such performances are much more superior to those of the other iron&#8208;based sulfides. This work provides a new paradigm for boosting SIBs' performances of iron&#8208;based sulfides by regulating p&#8208;band center (&#603;p) of S and weakening Fe&#9472;S bonds.

         <title>Interface Design of Solid&#8211;Liquid Hybrid Electrodes for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel solid&#8211;liquid hybrid electrode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The electrode structure includes: an upper liquid metal phase containing silicon microparticles, which can connect fractured silicon and form a stable interface during cycling processes; and a lower solid&#8208;phase copper&#8208;gallium alloy, which ensures the robust adhesion of the electrode to the current collector during flexing processes.








Abstract
The silicon microparticles (SiMPs) offer a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion battery systems. However, the inevitable volume expansion (&gt;300%) of SiMPs during alloying often leads to particle breakage, interface rupture, and electrode separation, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed for designing a novel solid&#8211;liquid hybrid electrode (Si@EGaSn) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The Si@EGaSn electrode has a liquid&#8208;phase top layer containing SiMPs and a solid&#8208;phase copper gallium alloy bottom layer. The top layer can not only electrically connect the fractured SiMPs, but also form a stable solid electrolyte interface during alloying processes. The bottom layer can firmly adhere the electrodes to the current collector. Consequently, the optimal Si@EGaSn electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 767.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of &gt;99% during 200 cycles. After loading the electrode into metallic textiles, the assembled high&#8208;voltage pouch cell of NCM811//Si@EGaSn shows a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2, high volumetric energy density of 500&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and negligible capacity decay during 3000 flexing cycles at a small bending radius of 4.0&#160;mm. This work provides a new electrode design approach to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Resonant Levels Induced Seebeck Coefficient Matching Contributes to High Thermoelectric Cooling Efficiency in p&#8208;type SnSe Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed that doping indium (In) in p&#8208;type SnSe introduced resonant levels near the Fermi level in the valence bands, effectively enhancing the local density of states and significantly boosting the Seebeck coefficient. These improvements result in extraordinary near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric performances. Specifically, the optimal SnSe&#8208;0.7%In sample achieved a PF of &#8776;55 &#181;Wcm&#8722;1K&#8722;2, and a ZT of &#8776;1.0 at 300 K.








Abstract
Tin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising thermoelectric cooling candidate, exhibiting room&#8208;temperature performance comparable to that of commercial bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3). However, the Seebeck coefficient of p&#8208;type SnSe crystals remains significantly lower than that of n&#8208;type Bi&#8322;(Te, Se)&#8323; (BTS), and the resulting mismatches hinder effective utilization of its excellent cooling potential. To address this limitation, resonant levels are introduced in the valence bands of hole&#8208;doped SnSe through indium&#8208;doping, which increased the density of states and thereby boosted the Seebeck coefficient. This strategy enable the power factor to reach &#8776;55 &#181;Wcm&#8722;1K&#8722;2 and ZT value of &#8776;1.0 at 300 K, with a more matching Seebeck coefficient of &#8776;211 &#181;VK&#8722;1. Furthermore, a full&#8208;scale thermoelectric cooler incorporating the p&#8208;type SnSe paired with n&#8208;type BTS demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference (&#916;Tmax) of &#8776;81.1 K at 343 K. A SnSe&#8208;based single&#8208;leg device achieve a conversion efficiency of &#8776;7.0% under a &#916;T of 250 K. These findings highlight that matching thermoelectric parameter of p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type materials is crucial for enhancing the cooling efficiency of devices, and engineering resonant energy levels constitutes a robust strategy for solving the inherent performance limitations of p&#8208;type SnSe in practical thermoelectric applications.

         <title>Decoupling Self&#8208;Matching Effect Between Cathode and Anode in Hybrid Electrochemical Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study decouples the effects of cathode&#8208;anode matching and coupling on performance of a system in hybrid electrochemical capacitors (HECs) which are like black boxes. By modulating the three&#8208;electrode mode to focus on the self&#8208;matching effect of cathode&#8208;anode potentials ranges, the matching and coupling is correlated with current, providing a guiding principle for predicting and optimizing the performance of HECs based on electrode.








Abstract
Hybrid electrochemical capacitors (HECs) are advanced energy storage devices that offer high energy density, high power density, and long cycle life by integrating the energy storage mechanisms of both batteries and supercapacitors. The electrochemical coupling resulting from the cathode&#8208;anode kinetic differences severely restricts the accuracy of predicting the performance of HECs based on electrode performance. However, no general method can decouple the effects of cathode&#8208;anode kinetics matching on electrochemical performance by integrating electrochemical coupling from an electrochemical perspective. Here, using an integrated method that combines two distinct three&#8208;electrode testing modes in the typical sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors, the self&#8208;matching effect of cathode&#8208;anode working potential ranges is first refined as the foundation for kinetic matching and electrochemical coupling. The discrepancies and interdependencies in cathode&#8208;anode electrochemical coupling for an individual kinetic match are decoupled by examining the impact of the self&#8208;matching effect on the electrochemical results. The critical matching current density is introduced as a key kinetic parameter for evaluating the degree of cathode&#8208;anode matching in complex electrochemical systems. This advancement provides an innovative design principle for electrode matching and coupling in high&#8208;performance HECs.

         <title>Linking Electron Cloud Potential Wells to Achieve Ultrahigh Output Current in a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linking the electron cloud potential wells of triboelectric materials could lead to a huge increase in the output current of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). This hypothesis was verified by embedding conductive reduced graphene oxide into triboelectric layers of ethyl cellulose and polydimethylsiloxane, realizing a record&#8208;high current density of &#8764;3533 mA&#160;m&#8722;2. This TENG also showed excellent endurance in high&#8208;humidity and rainy environments. 








Abstract
With the development of the Internet of Things and intelligent robots, there is an increasing demand for distributed flexible sensor networks and portable power devices. As a self&#8208;powered sensor and micro/nano powering supplier, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that can convert the irregular and ubiquitous mechanical energy into electrical energy demonstrates promising applications in human&#8211;machine interaction, soft robotics, wearable healthcare, etc. However, achieving ultrahigh current density and water resistance in TENGs remains challenging, mainly due to the non&#8208;utilization of the electrons in the interior of triboelectric layers. Herein, it is proposed that linking the electron cloud potential wells (ECPWs) of triboelectric materials can lead to a huge increase in the output current of TENGs. This hypothesis is verified by embedding a conductive network of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into the triboelectric layers of ethyl cellulose (EC) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The TENG based on this model demonstrates a record&#8208;high current density of &#8776;3533&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 among the TENGs working in contact&#8208;separation mode. In addition, this TENG shows excellent endurance in high&#8208;humidity and even rainy environments. This work provides a novel and promising strategy for fabricating TENGs with ultrahigh output current and water resistance, largely expanding their practical applications in many fields.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Mechanoluminescent Haptic Sensor via Dual&#8208;Functional Chromatic Filtration by a Conjugated Polymer Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence (ML) platform is achieved through&#160;chromatic filtration strategy using a conjugated polymer shell (F8BT) on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide microparticles. This shell narrows the emission bandwidth, selectively filtering out blue noise, while simultaneously boosting intensity via ML photon recycling process. The dual action significantly enhances signal clarity and stability, enabling precise multi&#8208;signal differentiation in haptic sensors and advanced stress&#8208;sensing technologies.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence materials have emerged as promising candidates for haptic interface sensors due to their mechanically driven luminescent property. However, the inherently broad emission spectra of most mechanoluminescence materials hinder sharp signal generation and high spectral resolution. Here, a chromatic filtration strategy is suggested employing poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) as a conjugated polymer shell on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide to achieve a highly refined and intensified signal. By selectively suppressing spectral components below 490&#160;nm, the F8BT shell effectively narrows the emission bandwidth, yielding a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#160;nm during the mechanoluminescence process. In particular, F8BT shell efficiently mitigates signal intensity loss, which can be ascribed to the chromatic filtration ability, through mechanoluminescence photon recycling performance. This dual functionality significantly reduces spectral noise in the blue region with high intensity, enhancing the resolution in actual powerless haptic controllers. The novel approach establishes a scalable framework for high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence platforms, providing a versatile pathway toward next&#8208;generation, power&#8208;free stress&#8208;sensing applications with unprecedented spectral precision and optical fidelity.

         <title>Eliminating Mobility&#8208;Thickness Dependence in Transparent Conductive Oxide Layer Growth: A Critical Nucleation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical nucleation strategy is developed to eliminate mobility&#8208;thickness dependence in transparent conductive oxides. Via regulating reactive plasma deposition conditions, ultrathin cerium&#8208;doped indium oxide layers are fabricated with high mobility values. This strategy establishes a viable pathway for achieving high&#8208;quality ultrathin oxide semiconductor films in optoelectronic applications.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A critical nucleation strategy is developed to eliminate mobility-thickness dependence in transparent conductive oxides. Via regulating reactive plasma deposition conditions, ultrathin cerium-doped indium oxide layers are fabricated with high mobility values. This strategy establishes a viable pathway for achieving high-quality ultrathin oxide semiconductor films in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Metallic Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Cavity&#8208;Enhanced "Pseudo&#8208;Charge Transfer" Absorption for Efficient Narrowband Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance narrowband short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetector is fabricated through engineering a pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer state by doping an ultra&#8208;narrow&#8208;gap molecule coupled with an optimized Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonant cavity. This co&#8208;design approach yields spectrally selective photodetectors EQE exceeding 40% at zero&#8208;bias at 1020 nm, a FWHM of &lt;60 nm, a detectivity &gt; 3 &#215; 1013 Jones, and an over 140dB dynamic range, while maintaining excellent bending and environmental stability.








Abstract
Narrowband short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors, combining wavelength&#8208;specific detection with the inherent advantages of organic semiconductors, are important candidates for many applications like medical diagnostics, industrial sorting, and environmental monitoring. However, previously reported spectral&#8208;narrowing strategies often compromise device performance through structural complexity and intrinsic limitations of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) absorption, even when coupled with strong cavity device architectures. To address this, a pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer state is engineered by doping an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap third component, simultaneously optimizing electrode processing to minimize parasitic absorption and interface energetic barriers. This co&#8208;design approach yields spectrally selective photodetectors with an EQE exceeding 40% at zero&#8208;bias at 1020 nm, a FWHM of &lt; 60 nm, a detectivity &gt; 3 &#215; 1013 Jones, and an over 140dB dynamic range, while maintaining flexibility. PET&#8208;based devices show &lt;5% performance degradation after 3000 bending cycles. This work establishes a general design paradigm for organic narrowband photodetectors that combines laboratory&#8208;scale performance with practical manufacturability for wearable and large&#8208;area SWIR applications.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Biomimetic Intelligent Immune Organelles for the Treatment of Bladder&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an orbital hybridization rhenium (Re)&#8208;palladium (Pd) nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic intelligent immune organelles for the treatment of bladder&#8208;metastasized tumors. Additionally, the organelle demonstrates a response to the tumor microenvironment by releasing RePd nanozyme and PD&#8208;L1 nb, which enhance tumor accumulation and facilitate synergistic catalytic&#8208;photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Immune&#8208;checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of bladder cancer. However, inadequate immune responses restrict their clinical application. To increase the efficacy of ICIs, a nanozyme&#8208;based intelligent biomimetic immune organelle has been developed for the treatment of metastatic bladder tumors. Initially, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanozyme platform is constructed using 1,2&#8208;Distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;Tk&#8208;(polyethylene glycol) (DSPE&#8208;TK&#8208;PEG)&#160;to assemble ultrasmall p&#8208;d orbital hybrid bimetallic rhenium (Re)&#8208;palladium (Pd) nanozyme. The orbital hybridization between the Re and Pd atoms significantly enhances the peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity of the Pd nanozyme. Additionally, the RePd nanozyme exhibits notable glutathione oxidase (GSH&#8208;OXD)&#8208;like activity, which reduces the clearance of ROS and enhances its capacity to induce oxidative stress. This platform is then coated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) engineered with PD&#8208;L1 nanobody (nb), which form RePd@OMVsPD&#8208;L1 nb. Upon entry into the tumor microenvironment, the RePd nanozyme is released, and the PD&#8208;L1 nb specifically binds to the tumor cell membrane to relieve its inhibition of T cells. Moreover, RePd@OMVsPD&#8208;L1 nb demonstrates enhanced tumor accumulation and promotes synergistic catalytic&#8210;photothermal therapy, inducing immunogenic cell death and promoting immune activation through the release of adjuvants. Consequently, the efficacy of PD&#8208;L1 nb is significantly improved, leading to the effective eradication of tumor cells and the inhibition of recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>A Universal Orientation&#8208;Engineering Strategy for Enhancing Mechano&#8208;Electric Conversion Performance in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Biopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;output triboelectric biopolymers through multiscale orientation engineering. The triboelectric output performance of silk fibroin is systematically analyzed for the first time from the perspective of interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport. The enhanced mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanism of orientation&#8208;optimized semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers is further explored based on molecular dynamic simulations and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials are the key to developing high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators. However, most semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers exhibit low triboelectric output performance due to the limitations in their intrinsic structure and physicochemical properties. Herein, orientation&#8208;regulated silk fibroin nanofibers (SFNs) with phase transition polarization and enhanced carrier migration are developed through high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;speed synergistic electrospinning technology. To analyze the molecular and aggregation structural changes of SFNs during high&#8208;voltage electric fields and stress&#8208;induced orientation processes, a multiscale structural evolutionary model is constructed from microscopic molecular chains to mesoscopic aggregation structures, and then to macroscopic fiber arrangements. It is found that as the orientation coefficient increases, the molecular conformation shifts from disordered &#945;&#8208;helices to ordered stacked &#946;&#8208;sheets. The aggregated molecular chains gradually slip, recombine, and arrange in an orderly manner along the direction of the stress field, which contributes to regulating the charge capture and carrier migration properties. The orientation&#8208;regulated SFNs significantly enhance the interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport capacity, thereby greatly improving the triboelectric performance. This work not only provides new insights into the mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanisms of semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers but also offers guidance for the design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials.

         <title>Photothermal Boost of Laser&#8208;Synthesized TiC Colloidal Variants with Engineered Solid&#8208;State Interfaces and Nitridation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiC Colloidal variants are synthesized via a green and waste&#8208;free laser fragmentation technique. The surface and elemental composition of the TiC colloids are tuned through laser&#8208;induced carbon nucleation and nitridation while maintaining their crystal integrity. These changes maximize light&#8211;colloid interactions, thereby improving photo thermalization. The underlying formation mechanisms of the TiC colloidal variants and their distinct photothermal responses are systematically investigated.








Abstract
Colloids are vital in many fields, including optics, energy conversion, and photothermal therapy. TiC colloids and their variants are synthesized in acetonitrile using a &#8220;green&#8221; femtosecond laser fragmentation method under varying laser&#8208;power conditions. Three distinct types of TiC colloids are produced: i) pure TiC spherical nanoparticles at low laser power (&lt;0.5&#160;W) through thermodynamically driven spheroidization; ii) TiC nanoparticles with a multilayer graphene shell at moderate laser power (0.5&#8211;1&#160;W) via carbon nucleation from acetonitrile decomposition; and iii) nitridated TiC nanoparticles with a multilayer graphene shell at high laser power (1.5&#8211;2&#160;W), achieved through nitrogen incorporation facilitated by the breakdown of strong C&#8801;N bonds in acetonitrile. The structural integrity of TiC in all three types of nanoparticles is maintained. The nanoparticle formation mechanisms are investigated, along with the effects of the interfaces and nitridation of TiC on its light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion. Photothermal measurements show a significant improvement in light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion for TiC nanoparticles with shells compared to pure TiC. This enhancement is attributed to light trapping within the colloidal solution, caused by the refractive index mismatch between TiC and graphene. Comparative scattering, absorption, and extinction efficiencies calculations based on Mie theory confirm this effect. Further photothermal enhancement is observed in the nitridated nanoparticles attributed to superior absorption in the NIR region. This study presents a sustainable approach for synthesizing photothermally efficient TiC&#8208;based colloids with nanoscale interface engineering and doping, enabling applications in energy and biomedical technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Colloids are vital in many fields, including optics, energy conversion, and photothermal therapy. TiC colloids and their variants are synthesized in acetonitrile using a &#8220;green&#8221; femtosecond laser fragmentation method under varying laser-power conditions. Three distinct types of TiC colloids are produced: i) pure TiC spherical nanoparticles at low laser power (&amp;lt;0.5&#160;W) through thermodynamically driven spheroidization; ii) TiC nanoparticles with a multilayer graphene shell at moderate laser power (0.5&#8211;1&#160;W) via carbon nucleation from acetonitrile decomposition; and iii) nitridated TiC nanoparticles with a multilayer graphene shell at high laser power (1.5&#8211;2&#160;W), achieved through nitrogen incorporation facilitated by the breakdown of strong C&#8801;N bonds in acetonitrile. The structural integrity of TiC in all three types of nanoparticles is maintained. The nanoparticle formation mechanisms are investigated, along with the effects of the interfaces and nitridation of TiC on its light-to-heat conversion. Photothermal measurements show a significant improvement in light-to-heat conversion for TiC nanoparticles with shells compared to pure TiC. This enhancement is attributed to light trapping within the colloidal solution, caused by the refractive index mismatch between TiC and graphene. Comparative scattering, absorption, and extinction efficiencies calculations based on Mie theory confirm this effect. Further photothermal enhancement is observed in the nitridated nanoparticles attributed to superior absorption in the NIR region. This study presents a sustainable approach for synthesizing photothermally efficient TiC-based colloids with nanoscale interface engineering and doping, enabling applications in energy and biomedical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Demonstration of strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and spin&#8208;locking of higher&#8208;order topological photonic states via momentum&#8208;biased orbital hybridization at corners of a Kagome triangular lattice.








Abstract
The advanced manipulation of topological photonic states with expanded degrees of freedom offers innovative ways of achieving robust light modulation and control. Here, by harnessing the orbital degree of freedom, strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and associated photonic spin&#8208;locking of Type&#8208;II higher&#8208;order topological states (HOTSs) are theoretically and experimentally demonstrated via momentum&#8208;biased orbital hybridization at the apex of a Kagome triangle lattice. The momentum bias, induced by the tilted incident light, not only produces symmetry breaking of the Kagome triangle lattice, but also introduces orbital momentum to Type&#8208;II HOTS. By attaining strong spin&#8208;locked SOC through momentum&#8208;biased topological orbital hybridization of Type&#8208;II HOTSs, the way is paved for the spin&#8208;based interplay and control between near&#8208;field and far&#8208;field in higher&#8208;order topological photonic crystals, with potential applications in polarization manipulation, spatial light modulation, quantum emitter control, and beyond.

         <title>Controllable Configuration of Constitutional Units in Vanadium/Iron&#8208;Based Polyanionic Compounds for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium/iron&#8208;based polyanionic compounds show significant potential as SIB cathodes. Herein, the effects of octahedral/tetrahedral constitutional unit characteristics on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between doping and Na&#8208;storage are systematically re&#8208;evaluated, with descriptors established for cross&#8208;material studies. Additionally, by proposing novel configuration compositions, controlling the arrangement of constitutional units, combined with interface/microstructure adjustments and theoretical simulations, to achieve multiscale optimization of polyanionic compounds.









Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are considered&#160;one&#160;of&#160;the&#160;most&#160;promising next&#8208;generation energy storage solutions. Among&#160;various electrode materials, vanadium/iron&#8208;based polyanionic compounds show significant potential as SIB cathodes due to their stable structures and high operating voltages, yet challenges persist in electron/Na+ transport and energy density. Although doping is an effective solution, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between dopant&#8208;induced configuration of octahedral/tetrahedral units and electrochemical performance remains poorly understood. Herein, the effects of composition and connection type of octahedral and tetrahedral constitutional units on Na&#8208;storage properties are systematically re&#8208;evaluated. By establishing descriptors and systematic analysis, the regulatory roles of octahedral/tetrahedral units are elucidated, establishing a fresh research perspective to describe the intrinsic impact of doping types on the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Additionally, other modification strategies are discussed to complement the research on the constitutional unit. In industrial applications, balancing electrochemical performance with air stability, cost, and large&#8208;scale production remains challenging, creating novel configuration compositions, controlling the structural arrangement of constitutional units, combined with interface and microstructural adjustments, are proposed to achieve multiscale modifications. Simultaneously, theoretical simulations will be employed to predict/validate their efficacy, providing insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost polyanionic compounds for sustainable SIBs.

         <title>Thermite Reaction&#8208;Induced Thermal Runaway of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor safety performances of high&#8208;energy lithium batteries are now threatening the lives and properties of human beings. Herein, it is found that cathode current collector aluminum (Al) foil can react with cathode active materials to form thermites. The thermite reaction releases energy accounting for &#8776;10 times of electric energy of the lithium&#8208;ion battery with 100% state of charge (SoC).








Abstract
Safety is a primary concern for the widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles as well as energy storage. Despite the numerous mechanisms proposed to explain thermal runaway (TR) and the various methods implemented to mitigate it, battery explosions still occur. This is predominantly due to an insufficient understanding of the TR mechanism. Herein, by combining various advanced analytical techniques with comprehensive analysis, it is found that aluminum (Al) foil, typically employed as the cathode current collector in LIBs, can react with some cathode active materials to form thermites. These thermite reactions generate substantial heat, contributing to explosions of LIBs, a mechanism that has been largely overlooked. Based on these findings, it is proposed that coating the Al foil with carbon can partially suppress these thermite reactions and substantially enhance the thermal stability of LIBs. This study offers new insights into the TR of LIBs and provides important guidance for developing safer batteries.

         <title>Synthesis Engineering of 2D Co3Sn2S2 with Tunable Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin non&#8208;layered 2D Co3Sn2S2 single crystal, which owns strong ferromagnetic order and giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE), are obtained through flux transformation mechanism. Combining dimensionality advantages and controllable Fe doping, a giant anomalous Hall angle of 48% and an anomalous Hall conductivity of 2200&#8201;&#937;&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are achieved, almost the highest ever recorded than in most known magnetic materials.








Abstract
2D kagome ferromagnetic materials serve as an exceptionally important platform for exploring spintronics and correlated quantum phenomena. However, the controllable synthesis of non&#8208;layered kagome ferromagnetic materials remains a significant challenge due to the absence of van der Waals gap. Here, it is shown that ultrathin non&#8208;layered 2D Co3Sn2S2 single crystal with kagome lattice, which owns strong ferromagnetic order and giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE), is obtained through flux transformation mechanism, where ultrathin Co3Sn2S2 single crystal is transformed from ultrathin layered intermediates of SnS2 or SnS. Magnetotransport measurements indicate that the AHE of the ultrathin Co3Sn2S2 single crystal is superior to those of its bulk and ultrathin polycrystalline counterparts. Further, combining dimensionality advantages and the introduced extrinsic contribution of Fe, where the doping concentration can be well controlled in 2D Co3Sn2S2, a giant anomalous Hall angle of 48% and an anomalous Hall conductivity of 2200&#8201;&#937;&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are achieved. Under zero magnetic field, these two values are, to the best of knowledge, almost the highest ever recorded than in most known magnetic materials. The results establish 2D non&#8208;layered ferromagnetic kagome lattice as a platform for exploration of quantum confinement effect and other correlated phenomena.

         <title>Automated Label&#8208;Free Assay for Viral Detection and Inhibitor Screening via Biomembrane&#8208;Functionalized Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectronic sensor integrating 2D cell membranes with organic microelectrode arrays enables detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 fusion pathways. Natively&#8208;expressed viral receptors promote monitoring of viral entry and screening of antibody&#8208;based inhibitors. Integration with microfluidics further enhances throughput and usability, establishing a powerful platform for investigating viral fusogenicity and accelerating antiviral drug development.








Abstract
Most virus infection assays have indirect readout such as virus number following entry (e.g., PCR, cell lysis). While effective, these technologies are labor&#8208;intensive, require specialized environments (e.g., sterile or RNA&#8208;free), and detect later&#8208;stage viral events like lysis or cell death, lacking sensitivity to early fusion events. To address these limitations, we present biologically relevant 2D membrane materials, host&#8208;cell&#8208;derived supported lipid bilayers (hcd&#8208;SLBs), integrated with organic microelectrode arrays (OMEAs) for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2)&#160;fusion. By overexpressing angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the native membranes, the platform functions as a viral sensor capable of detecting virus pseudo particles (VPPs) through the late pathway. Additionally, hcd&#8208;SLBs extracted from human lung epithelium expressing native ACE2 detect fusion events through the early pathway. The platform's utility as a drug&#8208;screening tool is demonstrated by testing antibodies targeting either the ACE2 on the host membrane or the viral spike (S) proteins. To enhance the throughput, microfluidics are integrated for automation and OMEAs are incorporated within each channel, miniaturizing the testing units. This system supports high&#8208;throughput data generation, automation, and scalability, providing an efficient platform for viral fusion detection that advances the study of pathogen&#8208;host interactions and accelerates antiviral drug discovery.

&lt;p&gt;A bioelectronic sensor integrating 2D cell membranes with organic microelectrode arrays enables detection of SARS-CoV-2 fusion pathways. Natively-expressed viral receptors promote monitoring of viral entry and screening of antibody-based inhibitors. Integration with microfluidics further enhances throughput and usability, establishing a powerful platform for investigating viral fusogenicity and accelerating antiviral drug development.

         <title>2D Cuprous Halide Scintillator with Dual Excitation&#8208;Dependent and Thermochromic Luminescence toward Multifunctional Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D lead&#8208;free cuprous halide, (AMP)2Cu2Br4 (AMP = N&#8208;aminomorpholine), exhibits excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent multicolor luminescence from blue, white to orange emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. The color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting and excellent scintillation performance support the promising applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode, laser technology, flexible temperature sensor, X&#8208;ray detection, medical diagnosis, and nondestructive inspection, etc.








Abstract
Excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent multicolor luminescent materials are valuable in advanced optoelectronic devices while they haven't been realized in 2D metal halides owing to the restrictions of Kasha's rule. Herein, we reported a novel 2D lead&#8208;free halide of (AMP)2Cu2Br4 (AMP = N&#8208;aminomorpholine) through structural engineering, in which the [Cu2Br4]2&#8722; layer is composed of corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;shared [CuBr4] tetrahedron. The non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure enables (AMP)2Cu2Br4 to exhibit an impressive second&#8208;harmonic generation signal of &#8776;0.8 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). Remarkably, (AMP)2Cu2Br4 possesses two independent self&#8208;trapped exciton&#8208;emitting states under different excitation energies, which display multicolor luminescence outputs from blue, white, to orange with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Additionally, the luminescence can be regulated in a wide temperature range of 300&#8211;400 K due to reversible energy transfer between two emitting bands, acting as a luminescence ratio thermometer with a ultrahigh relative thermal sensitivity of 56.755% K&#8722;1. High PLQY and large Stokes shift further endow (AMP)2Cu2Br4 strong radioluminescence with an ultrahigh light yield of 92,400 photons&#183;MeV&#8722;1, low detection limit of 121 nGyair&#183;s&#8722;1 and a short afterglow of 0.41&#160;ms. The abundant photophysical properties highlight the multiple optoelectronic applications of 2D cuprous halide in white light&#8208;emitting, laser technology, flexible temperature sensors, and X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Scalable Production of Highly&#8208;Reliable Graphene&#8208;Based Microchips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study compares GFETs with Al2O3 and hBN gate dielectrics on microchips, evaluating their stability and reliability. It highlights the superior performance of GFETs with hBN dielectric in maintaining ultra&#8208;low hysteresis (&#12296;20 mV) and minimal shifts in ID&#8208;VG characteristics over 2000 cycles, particularly at the charge neutrality point, in contrast to those with Al2O3 dielectric.








Abstract
Graphene is a gapless 2D material that could be used to fabricate superior electronic devices and circuits, particularly useful in the fields of telecommunication and sensing. While promising performance has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale, graphene integrated circuits at the wafer level suffer from poor reliability due to native defects, especially at interfaces with dielectrics and electrodes. Here, we show the fabrication of highly reliable graphene&#8208;based microchips, containing transistors and frequency doublers, on 200&#160;mm wafers through a multi&#8208;project wafer tape&#8208;out. Our transistors use multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as gate dielectric, and they exhibit record performance in terms of reliability. In particular, our hBN/graphene transistors show ultra&#8208;low hysteresis below 20 mV and negligible shifts of the on&#8208;state current and the charge neutrality point even after 2100 cycles. The ultra&#8208;stable response of our hBN/graphene transistors contrasts with that of devices using metal&#8208;oxide gate dielectrics (HfO2, Al2O3), which exhibit severe degradation after a few dozens of cycles. These results, consistent across multiple devices, show low variability and demonstrate a scalable process for mass production of graphene&#8208;based microchips.

         <title>Pyrazinoquinazoline&#8208;Based Eu&#8208;MOF Ratiometric Fluorescence Sensing: Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Meat Spoilage Enabled by Dynamic Regulation of LMCT/LLCT Triggered by Biogenic Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric platform using pyrazinoquinoxaline ligands, achieving biogenic amine detection via LMCT/LLCT&#8208;regulated fluorescence color shifts, integrated with hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated smartphone RGB analysis for real&#8208;time shrimp/chicken spoilage monitoring.








Abstract
This study develops a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric fluorescence sensor for biogenic amine detection in food spoilage monitoring. The sensor exhibits dual emission at 495 nm (ligand &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transition) and 615 nm (ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, LMCT) through the antenna effect. Biogenic amines specifically regulate the intensity ratio (I495nm/I615nm) by adsorbing into MOF pores via hydrogen bonding, triggering a dynamic equilibrium switch between LMCT and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (LLCT), causing fluorescence color shift from orange to green. Theoretical calculations reveal this response mechanism for the first time. Encapsulating Eu&#8208;MOF in agarose hydrogel&#8208;based portable tags with smartphone RGB analysis enables rapid quantitative detection of biogenic amines (detection limit: 3.7&#8211;9.1 &#181;M, response time &lt;10 min). The sensor allows real&#8208;time tracking of spoilage in shrimp and chicken stored at 0&#8211;25 &#176;C, with visual fluorescence color transitions reflecting amine accumulation levels. This work provides molecular insights into dynamic charge transfer regulation and establishes a high&#8208;sensitivity, visual, wearable solution for on&#8208;site food safety detection, advancing smart sensing technology in the food industry.

         <title>Biomolecular Condensates as Emerging Biomaterials: Functional Mechanisms and Advances in Computational and Experimental Approaches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of computational and experimental approaches for deciphering the underlying mechanism of biomolecular condensates and potential biomaterials&#160;design (Created in Biorender. Raza, Z. (2025) https://BioRender.com/irgmeqi).









Abstract
Biomolecular condensates, a ubiquitous class of biomaterials found in living cells, have been shown to be responsible for key physiological processes, such as gene regulation, signal transduction, and stress response. Since their discovery, extensive efforts have been devoted to this field to better understand the underlying mechanisms using both computational and experimental techniques. While great progress has been achieved, the key challenges still exist. With advancements in computational power and methods and improvements in experimental precision, the gap between computation and experimentation is gradually narrowing. By integrating these approaches, researchers can elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing biomolecular condensates. This review summarizes the recent progress in utilizing computational and experimental techniques to study biomolecular condensates. Detailed discussions are provided on the key advantages and limitations of each technique, along with their successful applications to specific systems. Moreover, further discussions are focused on the possibility of utilizing biomolecular condensates as a versatile platform for drug delivery and novel bioreactor design with the help of these techniques.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomolecular condensates, a ubiquitous class of biomaterials found in living cells, have been shown to be responsible for key physiological processes, such as gene regulation, signal transduction, and stress response. Since their discovery, extensive efforts have been devoted to this field to better understand the underlying mechanisms using both computational and experimental techniques. While great progress has been achieved, the key challenges still exist. With advancements in computational power and methods and improvements in experimental precision, the gap between computation and experimentation is gradually narrowing. By integrating these approaches, researchers can elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing biomolecular condensates. This review summarizes the recent progress in utilizing computational and experimental techniques to study biomolecular condensates. Detailed discussions are provided on the key advantages and limitations of each technique, along with their successful applications to specific systems. Moreover, further discussions are focused on the possibility of utilizing biomolecular condensates as a versatile platform for drug delivery and novel bioreactor design with the help of these techniques. Finally, future directions are outlined for technique development to better understand the role of biomolecular condensates in health and disease and enable their applications as tunable&#160;biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters: Ligand Programming for Functionality Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand programming offers a precise strategy to tune metal nanocluster surfaces at the atomic level. By controlling metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry, this approach enables customizable structures with enhanced catalytic, optical, and biomedical functions. This work highlights how precise surface engineering transforms metal nanoclusters into smart platforms for next&#8208;generation materials.








Abstract
Precise surface engineering of metal nanoclusters (MNCs) has emerged as a powerful strategy for tailoring their structural, electronic, and catalytic properties. On the basis of traditional surface chemistry, ligand programming enables atomic&#8208;level control over MNC functionality by modulating metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry. These three layers within the &#8220;Engineering Zone&#8221; define structural flexibility, charge transfer pathways, molecular rigidity, and surface accessibility, key factors in optimizing catalytic activity, luminescence efficiency, and molecular recognition. This Perspective explores the chemistry governing ligand&#8208;directed MNC behavior in the three layers, highlighting its role in catalysis, photonics, and biomedicine. By integrating coordination chemistry, intra/inter&#8208;ligand design, and interfacial interactions, how ligand programming transforms MNCs is demonstrated into tunable platforms for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Insights from MNCs also provide a model for advancing surface engineering in broader nanomaterials, paving the way for innovative applications in materials science.

         <title>A Roadmap for Plasma&#8208;Enabled Electrocatalysis in Urea Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular plasma&#8212;electrochemical platform enables fully electrified urea synthesis from air and CO2 under ambient conditions. This Review integrates plasma oxidation, C&#9472;N coupling electrolysis, mechanistic insights, and techno&#8208;economic metrics into a roadmap for scalable, distributed, and renewable fertilizer production.








Abstract
Conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch/Bosch&#8211;Meiser routes link global urea production to fossil fuel&#8208;based ammonia, accounting for &#8776;2% of the world's energy use and &#8776;1.5% of CO2 emissions. A modular, fully electrified alternative is charted that cleaves the problem at its natural fault line: a non&#8208;thermal plasma first upgrades air to nitrate, then a CO2/NO3&#8722; co&#8208;electrolyzer stitches the two C&#9472;N bonds of urea at ambient conditions. The lens is deliberately cross&#8208;disciplinary: every bottleneck is probed with the question, &#8220;Has a cognate field already cracked this?&#8221; If so, how can the solution be mirrored here? Plasma physics contributes to vibrational pumping, power modulated reactors, and in water quenching; CO2 and nitrate electro&#8208;reduction supply relay&#8208;site catalyst design, vacancy tuning, and pulsed&#8208;bias choreography; flow&#8208;battery engineering guides carbonate&#8208;resilient gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs) and zero&#8208;gap membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies (MEAs); and analytical chemistry adds two&#8208;probe assays that unmask false&#8208;positive amine/amide signals. Stitching these advances together, techno&#8208;economic modeling shows that sub&#8208;megajoule plasmas, &#8805;70% urea&#8208;selective in the electrolyzer, and renewable electricity (RE) at &#8804;3.5&#162; kWh&#8722;1 can push green urea below the fossil&#8208;based benchmark.

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Surface Autogenous Mineralization Enabling Epitaxial Zn Electrodeposition on Weakly Conductive Crystalline Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supercritical CO2&#8208;induced surface mineralization strategy is developed to form a dense ZnCO3 layer on Zinc (Zn) anodes. This crystalline coating enables epitaxial Zn growth along the (0002) plane, suppressing dendrites and enhancing metal anode lifespan to over 3500&#160;h. The method is simple, scalable, and effective, offering a promising route for durable Zn metal anodes in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Regulating Zinc (Zn) nucleation and crystal growth on the anode surface is critical for reliable aqueous Zn metal batteries. However, achieving scalable and uniform surface modifications remains challenging. A Supercritical CO2&#8208;induced surface autogenous mineralization (SAM) strategy is introduced to fabricate a large&#8208;area, uniform, and crystalline Smithsonite autogenous regulating layer (ARL) on Zn foil. SAM enables in situ generation of H2CO3 and direct reactions with Zn under supercritical conditions, suppressing Zn2+ hydrolysis and inducing in situ mineralization. The ARL well&#8208;defined facets provide zincophilic sites, promoting single&#8208;crystal Zn nucleation and facilitating dense epitaxial deposition, thereby mitigating dendrites and enhancing cycling stability. The modified electrodes achieve over 1200&#160;h with 99.48% Coulombic efficiency in SZn&#8208;4||Cu cells, over 3500&#160;h in symmetrical cells, and over 8000 cycles in full cells at high current densities. This scalable SAM route offers a robust platform for high&#8208;performance, long&#8208;life Zn anodes in next&#8208;generation aqueous energy storage.

         <title>Multimaterial 3D Printing in Activating Bath Enables In Situ Polymerization of Thermosets with Intricate Geometries and Diverse Elastic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new embedded 3D printing (EMB3D) strategy enables in situ polymerization of DCPD/COD&#8208;based inks within a fugitive reactive matrix where the activator in the matrix cures the printed filament. Cured ink properties are tunable through DCPD&#8208;COD comonomer ratios, yielding materials from stiff thermosets to soft elastomers. This approach allows fabrication of complex 3D structures containing high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio features as small as 5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Polydicyclopentadiene, p(DCPD), is a high&#8208;performance thermoset valued for its exceptional toughness, strength, and stiffness. When copolymerized with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (COD), its mechanical properties can be tuned from glassy to rubbery at room temperature. While frontal polymerization enables a rapid and energy&#8208;efficient route to 3D print DCPD&#8208;based materials, challenges such as ink shelf life and gravitational distortion, especially in direct ink writing of soft COD&#8208;rich formulations, must be considered. Here, a complementary chemical strategy is presented, embedded 3D printing, that enables localized in situ polymerization of printed DCPD/COD inks within a reactive support matrix. The matrix provides both physical support and a reservoir of chemical activator, which diffuses into the ink, activates a latent bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) Ru precatalyst, and initiates ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. Curing begins at the ink&#8211;matrix interface and propagates inward via diffusion, stabilizing the interface and preventing capillary&#8208;driven deformation regardless of the matrix yield stress. This approach eliminates the need for cold storage, external curing, or photoinitiation, significantly expanding the processing window. Using this method, diverse thermosetting and elastomeric architectures are fabricated with features as small as 5 &#181;m and aspect ratios of 100, including interlinked chains, shallow spherical shells exhibiting snap&#8208;through buckling, and hair&#8208;like fin arrays inaccessible through traditional techniques.

         <title>Van der Waals Integration of 1D Nb2Pd3Se8 and 2D WSe2 for Gate&#8208;Tunable In&#8208;Sensor Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed&#160;self&#8208;powered photodetectors for in&#8208;sensor image processing by integrating high&#8208;quality 1D Nb2Pd3Se8 with 2D WSe2. The type&#8208;I junction and a 1D van der Waals interfaceenable gate&#8208;tunable switching between n&#8208;p and n&#8208;n+ configurations, yieldingbroadband bi&#8208;directional photoresponse. The devices achieve high responsivity, fast response, and efficient high&#8208;energy photon collection.








Abstract
1D and 2D integrations provide significant promise for machine vision by enabling compact, power&#8208;efficient&#160;optoelectronic devices. However, the potential of 1D materials in mixed&#8208;dimensional structures for convolutional image processing remains largely unexplored. Here, high&#8208;quality 1D&#8208;Nb2Pd3Se8 is synthesized and integrated with&#160;2D&#8208;WSe2 to form self&#8208;powered photodetectors, exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable bi&#8208;directional photoresponse for image processing. Utilizing the narrow band gap and favorable work function of 1D&#8208;Nb2Pd3Se8, a type&#8208;I junction and 1D van der Waals interface are established with transition metal dichalcogenides. The gate tunable built&#8208;in electric field enables switching&#160;between n&#8208;p and n&#8208;n+ configurations, allowing the drift photocurrent direction to be reversed, achieving both negative and positive photocurrent. Furthermore, efficient conversion of high&#8208;energy photons along one dimension enhances sensitivity at 375&#160;nm. The device achieves a responsivity of 232&#160;mA W&#8722;1, external quantum efficiency of 77% at 375 nm illumination, rapid response time of ~3 &#181;s, detectivity of 6.35 &#215; 1010 Jones, and broadband photodetection from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared. The demonstrated gate&#8208;controllable, bi&#8208;directional photoresponse with linear power dependence in a 1D heterojunction offers a promising platform for&#160;in&#8208;sensor convolutional processing with high integration and portability.

         <title>3D Photonic Metacrystals with Enhanced Collective Mie Resonances for Dual Structural Coloration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents high&#8208;quality 3D CdS metacrystals with long&#8208;range order that suppress radiation losses, yielding 13&#8208;fold enhanced magnetic Mie resonances (Q = 17) and dual nonfading structural coloration. &#160; Wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues F.








Abstract
3D photonic crystals offer nonfading structural coloration and complex optical properties through coupled Mie resonances in high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials. Although strong magnetic resonances make them promising, they often suffer from optical losses in the visible spectrum. Enhancing Mie resonances and quality factors through collective coupling in lithographically ordered arrays has been demonstrated. However, large&#8208;area applications using self&#8208;assembled colloidal resonators in metafluid inks have been limited by&#160;inadequate monodispersity and insufficient surface charge, hindering effective ordering. Here, we report high&#8208;quality 3D Mie&#8208;resonant metacrystals formed by high&#8208;temperature self&#8208;assembly of CdS nanoparticles (refractive index 2.5). Their long&#8208;range ordering attenuates local density of states overlapping with Mie resonances, minimizing external radiation losses and yielding&#160;one order of magnitude enhancement in collective Mie behavior. A 13&#8208;fold enhancement in magnetic Mie resonances with quality factors reaching 17 is experimentally demonstrated. The structures produce Bragg peaks that coexist with enhanced collective Mie resonances, enabling angle&#8208;dependent, dual nonfading structural coloration across the visible and near&#8208;infrared spectrum. As a proof of concept, wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues. This work opens new avenues in durable structural coloration and multifunctional optical platforms for applications such as ultrasensitive polarimetry and advanced optical sensing.

         <title>Oral Covalent Organic Frameworks as Dysbiosis&#8208;Mitigating Oxalate Sequestrants for Crystalline Nephropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally screened and engineered, nonabsorbable covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable a gut&#8208;restricted therapeutic strategy for hyperoxaluria&#8208;driven crystalline nephropathy. By promoting intestinal oxalate sequestration and microbiota restoration, the orally administered COFs reduce urinary oxalate excretion and suppress renal crystal deposition and inflammation via modulation of the gut&#8211;kidney axis, highlighting a translationally relevant utilization of COF&#8208;like materials for metabolite&#8208;driven pathologies.








Abstract
Hyperoxaluria&#8208;related crystalline nephropathy progresses through a dynamic interplay among oxalate crystallization, renal inflammatory cascades, and gut dysbiosis. However, concurrent interventions for these interconnected pathways remain elusive. Here, we leverage the gut&#8208;kidney axis to address this multifaceted renal issue by employing cationic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as dysbiosis&#8208;mitigating oxalate sequestrants. Oxalate adsorption assays and density functional theory calculations identify the HCl&#8208;activated pyridine&#8208;functionalized COF1&#8208;Cl with superior oxalate adsorption capacity (94.5 mg&#160;g&#8722;1) and selectivity. Oral administration of COF1&#8208;Cl in a rat model of hyperoxaluria effectively sequestrates oxalate within the gut and facilitates the transcellular secretion of serum oxalate into the intestinal lumen by upregulating the oxalate transporter (SLC26A6), resulting in decreased urinary oxalate excretion. Oxalate sequestration by COF1&#8208;Cl restores the gut microbiota diversity and promotes the rebalance of typical bacteria associated with oxalate metabolism, stone formation risk, and immune homeostasis. This local gut effect inhibits renal oxalate crystal deposition and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in amelioration of renal function as evidenced by improved glomerular filtration and decreased blood creatinine and urea nitrogen levels. COF1&#8208;Cl also demonstrates good biosafety due to its inert and nonabsorbable nature. This work highlights the potential of utilizing a gut&#8208;restricted porous crystalline framework to address metabolism&#8208;driven pathology via gut&#8208;organ crosstalk.

         <title>Bright Chromium&#8208;Sensitized Lanthanide NIR&#8208;II Mechanoluminescence in a Piezoelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applications of mechanoluminescent materials are constrained by their limited emission in the NIR and suboptimal luminescence intensity. Herein, a bright NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescent material is developed by co&#8208;doping Cr3+/Ln3+ in piezoelectric &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3. The nearly complete energy transfer from concentrated Cr3+ to Yb3+ (or Er3+) results in 5.9&#8208; and 3.0&#8208;fold stronger mechanoluminescence compared to the well&#8208;established CaZnOS:Yb3+ and CaZnOS:Er3+, respectively.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials are critical components of high&#8208;performance optical devices for frontier applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, non&#8208;destructive analysis, and deep&#8208;tissue imaging. In this work, a bright Cr3+&#8208;sensitized lanthanide NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescence (ML) is developed in piezoelectric &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3. Specifically, a nearly complete energy transfer (ET) from highly doped Cr3+ ions to Yb3+ and Er3+ acceptors is observed, resulting in pronounced ML at 1002 and 1542&#160;nm. The NIR&#8208;II luminescence intensity is further improved by cation alloying due to the promotion of octahedral distortion, culminating in 5.9&#8208; and 3.0&#8208;fold stronger ML emissions compared to the well&#8208;established CaZnOS:Yb3+ and CaZnOS:Er3+, respectively. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations revealed that the ML behavior with high dopant concentration is enabled by strain&#8208;induced piezoelectric potential without the involvement of trapping states, thus exhibiting exceptional cycling stability. Finally, an innovative multi&#8208;level encryption framework is established for information protection with wavelength&#8208;selective readout capabilities by optical or mechanical excitation.

         <title>Dynamic Localization Effect of Dendritic and Eutectic Growth Patterns Stimulated by Space Fluid Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the containerless experiment conducted in space, a spatially ordered separation of dendritic and eutectic regions is observed on the surface of Nb&#8208;Si alloy. Furthermore, the space fluid flow induces a dynamic localization effect in the growth patterns of these dendrites and eutectics. These findings provide new insights into in&#8208;situ manufacturing and controlled growth of crystals in space environments.








Abstract
Conventional solidification theory asserts that eutectic phases solidify into only one specific morphology at a fixed undercooling when volume effects are negligible, while dendrites adopt rotationally parabolic tips. Here, experiments aboard China Space Station reveal that space fluid flow localization reshapes these dynamics: confined solute&#8208;thermal coupling near solid&#8208;liquid interfaces drives transitions among three eutectic growth patterns (worm&#8208;like, lamellar, faceted). Simultaneously, Marangoni convection at large undercoolings induces non&#8208;parabolic dendritic tip morphologies (dome&#8208;like, finger&#8208;like, needle&#8208;like). Spatially ordered separation of eutectic and dendritic zones is governed by localized spherically symmetric temperature and concentration fields arising from space fluid flow, whereas buoyancy&#8208;driven convection in terrestrial gravity environment disrupts this ordering, perturbing phase domain distributions. When solidified at a small undercooling, the weak convection during late stage preserves the near&#8208;perfect symmetry of dendrites under microgravity. These findings uncover novel dendritic and eutectic growth patterns under microgravity and may be applied to in&#8208;situ space manufacturing and controlled growth of crystals.

&lt;p&gt;In the containerless experiment conducted in space, a spatially ordered separation of dendritic and eutectic regions is observed on the surface of Nb-Si alloy. Furthermore, the space fluid flow induces a dynamic localization effect in the growth patterns of these dendrites and eutectics. These findings provide new insights into in-situ manufacturing and controlled growth of crystals in space environments.

         <title>Cage Effect of Nitrogen Oxide Radicals Enables Li&#8208;NOx Cell with a 3.8&#160;V Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Li&#8208;NOx battery chemistry achieves reversible 3.8 V operation by harnessing the cage effect of nitrogen oxide (NO) radicals. This strategy establishes a viable NOx redox mechanism for high&#8208;voltage energy storage and presents a sustainable route for NOx valorization.








Abstract
The utilization of redox&#8208;active gas as cathode materials has been proposed as a promising approach to meet the demand for next&#8208;generation battery technologies. Toward this end, nitrogen oxides (NOx)&#8212;inexpensive, abundant gases readily produced from ammonia on an industrial scale&#8212;is a promising energy storage media; however, its utilization as cathode material has not been achieved. In this work, the cage effect of NO and NO2 radicals are utilized to stabilize the charge product of Li&#8208;NOx cell as N2O3. This cell operates via reversible redox of LiNO3 to N2O3, achieving a specific capacity of 1,570&#160;mA h gcarbon&#8722;1 or 25&#8201;mA h&#8201;cmelectrode&#8722;2&#160;at a full cell voltage of 3.85&#160;V with an average energy efficiency of 89% at a current density up to 2&#160;mA cmelectrode&#8722;2. These metrics represent one of the highest areal capacity, current density, cell voltage, and energy efficiency reported for a metal&#8208;gas cells.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Order and Strong Quantum Coupling Enabled Stable Carrier Transport for Reliable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address memristor reliability issues caused by stochastic carrier transport, long&#8208;range ordered quantum dot (QD) superlattices with strong quantum coupling are constructed via a dual&#8208;ligand strategy, minimizing energetic and positional disorder from atomic&#8208;scale QDs to macroscopic devices. This enhanced coupling surpasses localized quantum&#8208;confined states, ensuring stable, efficient carrier transport and yielding remarkable performance enhancements in neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing based on memristors holds significant potential for performing massively parallel computational tasks with high accuracy. However, its practical application is significantly limited by poor reliability, primarily due to instability in carrier transport. Here, long&#8208;range ordered quantum dot (QD) superlattices with strong quantum coupling is presented to enable carrier transport stability and improve device reliability. Leveraging a data&#8208;assisted QD synthesis optimization loop, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs are synthesized with precisely controlled growth kinetics, crystal orientation, and surface chemistry. These QDs self&#8208;assemble into long&#8208;range ordered superlattices on flexible substrates, achieving a 56% reduction in inter&#8208;dot spacing (to 0.92 nm), aligned lattice orientations, and a 4.4&#8208;fold increase in carrier mobility. This architecture enables strong quantum coupling, effectively overcoming the limitations imposed by localized quantum&#8208;confined states. As a result, the QD&#8208;based memristors exhibit remarkable reliability, with variations below 0.1% over 8.4 &#215; 107 s of continuous operation and 106 rapid read cycles. They further demonstrate linear potentiation and depression characteristics (vp = 2.03 and vd = 2.33), a wide conductance range (Gmax/Gmin = 264), and high recognition accuracy (93.31%) as validated by chip&#8208;level convolutional neural network simulations. This work establishes a robust and flexible platform for memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic computing, offering a promising route to overcoming critical challenges in device reliability and computational performance.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Double&#8208;Drive Water Evaporation&#8208;Induced Generator Operating Without Liquid Water Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique double&#8208;drive WEG (DWEG) is developed with excellent electrical output performance (&gt;1 V, &gt;1 &#181;A cm&#8722;2) in multiple water sources and unveil the corresponding double&#8208;drive operation mechanism. Not limited to liquid water sources, DWEG can also generate sustainable electricity through the spontaneous harvesting of minimal water from the soil, even in low&#8208;temperature (&#8722;12 &#176;C) environments.








Abstract
Restricted electrical output and the heavy reliance on liquid water sources severely limit the further development of water evaporation&#8208;induced generators (WEGs) based on the inherently slow phase transition of water molecules. Here, inspired by the rolling logs to transport boulders, a double&#8208;drive WEG (DWEG) is developed, in which double ionic circulations and ion&#8208;electronic friction provide intensive horsepower and grip for energy capture. DWEGs applied in deionized water can continuously generate a high voltage of 1.13 V and a stable current of 10.54 &#181;A (1.76 &#181;A cm&#8722;2) under ambient conditions (&#8776;20 &#176;C, &#8776;43% RH). In addition, benefiting from the high osmotic pressure and mechanical strength of ionized composite hydrogels, DWEGs can be directly plugged into soil with minimal water (as little as 12.5 wt.%) to generate electricity, eliminating the reliance on a liquid water source. Interestingly, a high electrical output (0.65 V, 0.89 &#181;A) is sustained (&gt;60 h) at low&#8208;temperature (e.g., &#8722;12 &#176;C), overcoming the temporal and geographical restrictions of conventional WEGs in their practical applications.

         <title>Reverse Charge Transfer Drives d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization in Ruthenium&#8211;Oxygen Modified Zn3In2S6 for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the electronegativity difference between oxygen and sulfur element, we designed and implemented ruthenium and oxygen co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6, which achieved controllable reverse photo&#8208;generated charge transfer. This carrier transportation enhanced the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between ruthenium and oxygen, promoting efficient charge redistribution, strong oxygen adsorption and activation, ultimately leading to superior hydrogen peroxide evolution rate.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is emerging as a promising approach for sustainable H2O2 production. However, controlling the electronic structure and charge carrier dynamics to enhance oxygen adsorption and activation remains a major challenge. Here, ruthenium and oxygen co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S&#8326; (O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS) is presented, a catalyst design to achieve reverse photogenerated carrier transfer through tailored electronic modulation. The introduction of oxygen atoms, with higher electronegativity than sulfur, induces significant surface charge redistribution and transforms the Ru&#9472;S coordination environment from Ru&#9472;S4 (in Ru&#8208;ZIS) to Ru&#8208;S&#8321;O3 (in O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS), as revealed by synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (SR&#8208;XAS). This structural transition drives a reversal in charge carrier transfer pathways: in Ru&#8208;ZIS, photogenerated electrons transfer from Ru sites to In sites, whereas in O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS, electrons transfer from In sites to Ru sites, as validated by in situ XPS and fs&#8208;TA spectra. This reverse charge transfer enhances d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between Ru and O2, facilitating efficient charge redistribution, strong oxygen adsorption, and activation. In situ spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further corroborate these mechanistic insights. As a result, the O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS catalyst exhibits a photocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 3659&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ambient conditions without requiring sacrificial agents, significantly outperforming conventional Zn3In2S6&#8208;based systems and other reported photocatalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis.

This structural transition drives a reversal in charge carrier transfer pathways: in Ru-ZIS, photogenerated electrons transfer from Ru sites to In sites, whereas in O-Ru-ZIS, electrons transfer from In sites to Ru sites, as validated by in situ XPS and fs-TA spectra. This reverse charge transfer enhances d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between Ru and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, facilitating efficient charge redistribution, strong oxygen adsorption, and activation. In situ spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further corroborate these mechanistic insights. As a result, the O-Ru-ZIS catalyst exhibits a photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 3659&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under ambient conditions without requiring sacrificial agents, significantly outperforming conventional Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-based systems and other reported photocatalysts for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Scale&#8208;Design Principle at Electrical Confinement Materials for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a new design paradigm for electrical confinement materials (ECMs) aimed at water purification, utilizing the energy equivalence design principle to achieve optimized reaction kinetics efficacy. This approach provides a scalable strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance ECMs, effectively overcoming the limitations associated with small&#8208;scale material synthesis and enhancing anti&#8208;fouling capabilities in response to environmental disturbances.








Abstract
Electrochemical water treatment is a promising sustainable environmental remediation technology due to its eco&#8208;friendliness, ease of control, and significant effectiveness in degrading organic pollutants. The electrical confinement materials (ECMs) exhibit enhanced mass transfer characteristics that substantially reduce energy consumption and reaction time within the system. In this study, the design strategies of ECMs are evaluated from the perspective of trade&#8208;offs in equivalent energy drives, including pressure&#8208;driven and electric&#8208;driven forms. The reaction efficiency and the potential for interface anti&#8208;fouling are investigated across confined spatial scales. These findings indicate that, in scenarios characterized by the equivalent energy input principle, the ECMs can effectively address the challenges associated with material spatial scale design. This advancement facilitates the achievement of energy equivalence in the water purification process, particularly in addressing significant application challenges related to loading catalytic layers within confined channels. The result on the anti&#8208;fouling potential of ECMs indicates that an interface oxidation mechanism dominated by hydroxyl radicals is more effective in resisting electrode deactivation caused by dissolved natural polymers in the water matrix. This study offers key insights for designing anti&#8208;fouling and energy&#8208;saving interfaces with efficient mass transfer in water treatment, enhancing the potential of electrochemical methods.

         <title>Molecularly Programmed Twisting in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Crystal Enables Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic crystal is reported to exhibit extraordinary anhydrous superprotonic conductivity for promising application as a solid electrolyte in high&#8208;temperature fuel cells.








Abstract
A Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Crystal (HOC&#8208;88) is reported that achieves unprecedented anhydrous superprotonic conductivity through a molecular topology&#8208;driven hierarchical assembly strategy. Single&#8208;crystal analysis uncovers a saddle&#8208;distorted &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomer with eight phenolic hydroxyl groups, whose synergistic geometric confinement enables spontaneous formation of self&#8208;templated 3D proton highways&#8208;a phenomenon yet to be observed in crystalline organic conductors. The double torsion of the &#960;&#8208;system induces helical cooperativity between hydrogen&#8208;bonded lamellae and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked columns, generating interconnected proton pathways with negative thermal expansion behavior along the c&#8208;axis. This unique mechanism allows HOC&#8208;88 to maintain ultrastable proton conduction without humidity dependence, surpassing all known HOCs and routing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF/COF analogues. Crucially, the framework demonstrates chemical omniphobicity&#8208;retaining crystallinity in boiling water (100 &#176;C), concentrated acid (0.5&#160;m H2SO4 and 1&#160;m HCl), and 300&#160;&#176;C in air conditions. When deployed in an H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell prototype, it establishes the first experimental evidence of HOC operating in practical high&#8208;temperature electrochemical devices. The findings reveal that controlled helical distortion in &#960;&#8208;systems can programmatically dictate long&#8208;range proton ordering, opening an unexplored dimension for designing next&#8208;generation solid electrolytes.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) hold great promise for use in a wide range of biomedical applications. This review covers four stimulus modalities, namely, electrical, optical, magnetic, and ultrasound, and their associated SRMs. It provides a summary of the materials in each modality, their development, and current research perspectives. This review also provides a detailed analysis of the key challenges for translating these SRM technologies into clinical use.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) are materials that change properties when exposed to external or internal stimuli. They respond to physiological changes within cells and tissues, as well as external triggers including light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity. In medicine, SRMs have diverse applications spanning drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostics. They enable targeted drug release at specific times and locations, facilitate tissue generation and repair, and enhance disease detection capabilities. Beyond medical uses, SRMs are employed in smart coatings and artificial muscle systems. The breadth of biomedical applications for SRMs is extensive, generating substantial research into novel and innovative material development. Challenges in creating safe and efficient SRMs for medical treatments have driven innovative approaches in two key areas: functionalizing and modifying naturally occurring materials and developing new synthetic nanomaterials. The complexity of producing effective SRMs has necessitated creative solutions to overcome safety and efficiency barriers in medical applications. This ongoing research continues to expand the potential therapeutic uses of these responsive materials. This review examines literature focused on SRM development for external stimuli responses, particularly light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity, rather than covering the complete spectrum of stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

         <title>A Flexible and Repairable Ultra&#8208;Broadband Electromagnetic Wave Absorber by Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the working principle of membrane&#8208;free organelles for the construction of biological cells, a self&#8208;assembly strategy of photopolymerization&#8208;induced phase transition driving liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is proposed to construct conductive nanochannels and abundant heterogeneous interface for the repairable and durable ultra&#8211;broadband electromagnetic wave absorber (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;dB from 5 to 40&#8201;GHz).








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;broadband electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption depends on the balance of impedance matching and attenuation, which heavily rely on the structural integrity via rigorous production process or extreme reaction condition, constraining their applications particularly in biomedicine and flexible electronics. Here, a simple one&#8208;step method is proposed to access a flexible and repairable ultra&#8208;broadband EMW absorber by the photopolymerization of one common monomer in ionic liquid. The liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation process of poly (N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) and ionic liquid results in a high polymer content network comprising conductive nanochannels intertwined with abundant polymer chain/ionic liquid heterogeneous interface (basic unit &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm). This strategy effectively achieves&#160;the balance of impedance matching and attenuation, and accesses the broadest effective absorption band in the single&#8208;layer absorbers (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;dB from 5 to 40&#8201;GHz). Moreover, the resultant polymer absorbers have high fracture strength (&#8776;8.2&#160;MPa), fracture energy (&#8776;774 kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and transparency (&#8776;85%), while being highly stretchable (&#8776;900% strain) and having repairable microwave absorption (&#8776;97% repaired in effective absorption bandwidth). Overall, this work provides a general strategy for the fabrication of ultra&#8208;broadband EMW absorbers, which will promote potential advances in flexible electromagnetic materials.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Intrinsic Constraint Boosts Slow&#8208;Thermalization and Fast&#8208;Transfer of Carriers in FAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy utilizing a strain&#8208;induced intrinsic constraint with triamino&#8208;linear GA&#8208;acid is implemented to create anisotropic surface strain (&#603; = 0.53%&#8211;0.78%) on QDs for stabilizing the perovskite lattice. Simultaneously, modulation of Pb&#8208;I/O bonding and Pb&#8208;Pb spacing optimizes nonadiabatic coupling and enhances charge carrier transfer. Finally, FAPbI3 QDSCs achieved a PCE of 17.11%, while retaining 81.4% of initial PCE after 1000 h of aging.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide quantum dots (FAPbI3 QDs) are extensively utilized in photovoltaic applications due to their superior optoelectronic characteristics. Nonetheless, the weak ionic bonds within their soft lattice structure lead to structural deformation, which causes a disordered charge distribution of FAPbI3 QDs. Stress engineering not only can mitigate the inherent soft lattice by reinforcing ion bonds but also can promote electron localization, thus enhancing charge carrier transfer. This work introduces a strain&#8208;induced intrinsic constraint (SIC) strategy that employs steric bulk modulation of nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands to induce anisotropic surface strain (&#603; = 0.53&#8211;0.78) in FAPbI3 QDs. By systematically designing nitrogen&#8208;coordinating ligands, guanidinium acetate (GA&#8208;acid) is demonstrated to facilitate controlled anisotropic lattice strain by filling A&#8208;site vacancies while simultaneously establishing a self&#8208;reinforcing stress, which effectively strengthens the antibonding interaction of Pb&#8208;O/I and reduces Pb&#8208;Pb orbital overlap, resulting in &#8220;slow&#8208;thermalization and fast&#8208;transfer&#8221; synergy for enhanced charge transfer. The PQDSCs engineered using the SIC approach achieve a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 17.11% and a highest short&#8208;circuit current density of 20.96 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. It is anticipated that stress&#8208;induced modulation of nanocrystals offers a critical insight for advancing the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Recent Advances in Moir&#233; Superlattice Systems by Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial moir&#233; superlattices have become a fertile playground for emergent quantum phenomena. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures and thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. Major advances in the ARPES studies of moir&#233; superlattices are reviewed and new experimental directions are discussed.








Abstract
The last decade has witnessed a flourish in 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as atomic&#8208;scale Legos. Artificial moir&#233; superlattices via stacking 2D materials with a twist angle and/or a lattice mismatch have recently become a fertile playground exhibiting a plethora of emergent properties beyond their building blocks. These rich quantum phenomena stem from their nontrivial electronic structures that are effectively tuned by the moir&#233; periodicity. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures with decent momentum, energy, and spatial resolution, thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. In this review, first, a brief introduction is given on advanced ARPES techniques and basic ideas of band structures in a moir&#233; superlattice system. Then ARPES research results of various moir&#233; superlattice systems are highlighted, including graphene on substrates with small lattice mismatches, twisted graphene/TMD moir&#233; systems, and high&#8208;order moir&#233; superlattice systems. Finally, it discusses important questions that remain open, challenges in current experimental investigations, and presents an outlook on this field of research.

         <title>Emerging Bioprinting for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a series of bioprinting techniques, polymer&#8208;based inks, and bioprinted devices are presented for wound healing. Recent advances in this cutting&#8208;edge field, including seven modification strategies of bioprinted devices and the clinical needs they address are summarized and discussed. Several frontiers of bioprinting, challenges, and future directions are highlighted and prospected.








Abstract
Bioprinting has attracted much attention due to its suitability for fabricating biomedical devices. In particular, bioprinting has become one of the growing centers in the field of wound healing, with various types of bioprinted devices being developed, including 3D scaffolds, microneedle patches, and flexible electronics. Bioprinted devices can be designed with specific biostructures and biofunctions that closely match the shape of wound sites and accelerate the regeneration of skin through various approaches. Herein, a comprehensive review of the bioprinting of smart wound dressings is presented, emphasizing the crucial effect of bioprinting in determining biostructures and biofunctions. The review begins with an overview of bioprinting techniques and bioprinted devices, followed with an in&#8208;depth discussion of polymer&#8208;based inks, modification strategies, additive ingredients, properties, and applications. The strategies for the modification of bioprinted devices are divided into seven categories, including chemical synthesis of novel inks, physical blending, coaxial bioprinting, multimaterial bioprinting, physical absorption, chemical immobilization, and hybridization with living cells, and examples are presented. Thereafter, the frontiers of bioprinting and wound healing, including 4D bioprinting, artificial intelligence&#8208;assisted bioprinting, and in situ bioprinting, are discussed from a perspective of interdisciplinary sciences. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries in Nonalkaline Aqueous Electrolytes: Progress, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn metal batteries in nonalkaline electrolytes can enable higher capacities and energy densities than conventional intercalated cathode materials. This review summarizes the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions of these four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials (MnO2, halogen materials, chalcogenide materials, and Cu&#8208;based compounds), and proposes some suggestions for their developments.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are attractive as safe and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. At present, due to the narrow window of the aqueous electrolyte and the strong reliance of the Zn2+ ion intercalated reaction on the host structure, the current intercalated cathode materials exhibit restricted energy densities. In contrast, cathode materials with conversion reactions can promise higher energy densities. Especially, the recently reported conversion&#8208;type cathode materials that function in nonalkaline electrolytes have garnered increasing attention. This is because the use of nonalkaline electrolytes can prevent the occurrence of side reactions encountered in alkaline electrolytes and thereby enhance cycling stability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions to these cathode materials. In this review, four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials including MnO2, halogen materials (Br2 and I2), chalcogenide materials (O2, S, Se, and Te), and Cu&#8208;based compounds (CuI, Cu2O, Cu2S, CuO, CuS, and CuSe) are reviewed. First, the reaction mechanisms and battery structures of these materials are introduced. Second, the fundamental problems and their corresponding solutions are discussed in detail in each material. Finally, future directions and efforts for the development of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries are proposed.

         <title>2D Ferroic Materials for Nonvolatile Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroic materials with ultrathin thickness and atomically smooth interface are promising candidates for constructing novel memory devices. This review surveys recent progress and proposes future prospects on 2D ferroic materials for nonvolatile memory applications, including 2D spintronic devices, 2D ferroelectric devices, and 2D multiferroic devices.








Abstract

         <title>Functional Materials for Subcellular Targeting Strategies in Cancer Therapy: Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates eight targeting strategies of functional materials that specifically target subcellular structures in tumor cells, including mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, Golgiosome, cytomembrane, and multi&#8208;organelle targeting strategies, and covers a wide range of functional materials, such as liposomes, metal nanoparticles, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, dendrimer nanoplatforms, carbon nanotubes, mitochondria&#8208;targeting mesoporous silica nanoparticles, carbon QD, amphiphilic copolymers, and small molecular compounds.








Abstract
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies have made significant progress in cancer treatment. However, tumor adjuvant therapy still faces challenges due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer, genomic instability, and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Functional materials possess unique biological properties such as long circulation times, tumor&#8208;specific targeting, and immunomodulation. The combination of functional materials with natural substances and nanotechnology has led to the development of smart biomaterials with multiple functions, high biocompatibilities, and negligible immunogenicities, which can be used for precise cancer treatment. Recently, subcellular structure&#8208;targeting functional materials have received particular attention in various biomedical applications including the diagnosis, sensing, and imaging of tumors and drug delivery. Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting materials can precisely accumulate therapeutic agents in organelles, considerably reduce the threshold dosages of therapeutic agents, and minimize drug&#8208;related side effects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the research progress in subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy based on functional nanomaterials. Moreover, it explains the challenges and prospects of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting functional materials in precision oncology. The review will serve as an excellent cutting&#8208;edge guide for researchers in the field of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis and Accurate Doping of Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconducting Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The up&#8208;to&#8208;date growth strategies for the controlled synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconducting TMDCs polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films are systematically summarized. The large&#8208;area accurate doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and its effect on the device performances are discussed. The challenges regarding the improvement of electronic device performances of 2D semiconducting TMDCs are highlighted, and the further research directions are proposed.








Abstract
2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) possess atomically thin thickness, a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, flexible band structure, and silicon&#8208;compatible feature, making them one of the most promising channels for constructing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art field&#8208;effect transistors in the post&#8208;Moore's era. However, the existing 2D semiconducting TMDCs fall short of meeting the industry criteria for practical applications in electronics due to their small domain size and the lack of an effective approach to modulate intrinsic physical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare and dope 2D semiconducting TMDCs single crystals with wafer size. In this review, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress regarding the wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D semiconducting TMDC polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films is systematically summarized. The domain orientation control of 2D TMDCs and the seamless stitching of unidirectionally aligned 2D islands by means of substrate design are proposed. In addition, the accurate and uniform doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and the effect on electronic device performances are also discussed. Finally, the dominating challenges pertaining to the enhancement of the electronic device performances of TMDCs are emphasized, and further development directions are put forward. This review provides a systematic and in&#8208;depth summary of high&#8208;performance device applications of 2D semiconducting TMDCs.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer Noninvasive Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper discusses the photothermal properties and biological mechanisms of nanomaterials, emphasizing a clinical and biological perspective. The primary focus is on current research regarding photothermal nanoparticles for breast cancer treatment: nanoparticle materials, breast characteristics, functional design, and commonly used adjuvant therapy in clinical practice.








Abstract
Rapid advancements in materials science and nanotechnology, intertwined with oncology, have positioned photothermal therapy (PTT) as a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for cancer. The breast's superficial anatomical location and aesthetic significance render breast cancer a particularly pertinent candidate for the clinical application of PTT following melanoma. This review comprehensively explores the research conducted on the various types of nanoparticles employed in PTT for breast cancer and elaborates on their specific roles and mechanisms of action. The integration of PTT with existing clinical therapies for breast cancer is scrutinized, underscoring its potential for synergistic outcomes. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying PTT and consequential modifications to the tumor microenvironment after treatment are elaborated from a medical perspective. Future research directions are suggested, with an emphasis on the development of integrative platforms that combine multiple therapeutic approaches and the optimization of nanoparticle synthesis for enhanced treatment efficacy. The goal is to push the boundaries of PTT toward a comprehensive, clinically applicable treatment for breast cancer.

         <title>Hemoperfusion Adsorbents for Removal of Common Toxins in Liver and Kidney Failure: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver and kidney failure leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxin, and creatinine in the blood and tissues, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins by extracorporeal system. Carbon materials, zeolites, MXenes, polymer materials, composite materials, porous materials, etc. have been developed as hemoperfusion adsorbents to remove common toxins in liver and kidney failure and to treat liver and kidney failure.








Abstract
Liver and kidney failure can lead to extensive accumulation of toxic metabolites in the blood and tissues, such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins from the blood and treat liver and kidney failure. However, the adsorption efficiency and safety of traditional hemoperfusion adsorbents are not ideal. Thus, it is urgent to develop adsorbents with good blood compatibility, as well as high adsorption and strong selective capacities, to fulfill the clinical needs. In recent years, new hemoperfusion adsorbents with improved adsorption performance and good blood compatibility have been developed. This review classifies and summarizes the recent research progress in hemoperfusion adsorbents for common blood toxins (bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea) produced by liver and kidney failure. The composition and structure of various toxin adsorbents, toxin adsorption performance, biocompatibility, blood safety, and the adsorption mechanisms of toxins are discussed. Based on a summary of recent studies, feasible strategies have been explored for designing and preparing hemoperfusion adsorbents to fulfill future development requirements. The trends and clinical application prospects of various toxin adsorbents are also discussed.

Nucleic acid plays a crucial role in countless biological processes. Hence, there is great interest in its detection and analysis in various fields from chemistry, biology, to medicine. Nanoporous crystalline materials exhibit enormous potential as an effective platform for nucleic acid recognition and application. These materials have highly ordered and uniform pore structures, as well as adjustable surface chemistry and pore size, making them good carriers for nucleic acid extraction, detection, and delivery. In this review, the latest developments in nanoporous crystalline materials, including metal organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) for nucleic acid recognition and applications are discussed. Different strategies for functionalizing these materials are explored to specifically identify nucleic acid targets. Their applications in selective separation and detection of nucleic acids are highlighted. They can also be used as DNA/RNA sensors, gene delivery agents, host DNAzymes, and in DNA&#8208;based computing. Other applications include catalysis, data storage, and biomimetics. The development of novel nanoporous crystalline materials with enhanced biocompatibility has opened up new avenues in the fields of nucleic acid analysis and therapy, paving the way for the development of sensitive, selective, and cost&#8208;effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools with widespread applications.

         <title>Machine Learning Paves the Way for High Entropy Compounds Exploration: Challenges, Progress, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) revolutionizes high entropy compounds (HECs) research, addressing their complex structures. It models HEC at atomic and macroscopic levels, using various algorithms. Accurate data, feature engineering, and cross&#8208;validation are key for robust models. ML's potential in HEC exploration is significant, driving Artificial&#8208;intelliegence&#8208;assisted material discovery.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the research field of high entropy compounds (HECs), which have gained worldwide attention due to their vast compositional space and abundant regulatability. However, the complex structure space of HEC poses challenges to traditional experimental and computational approaches, necessitating the adoption of machine learning. Microscopically, machine learning can model the Hamiltonian of the HEC system, enabling atomic&#8208;level property investigations, while macroscopically, it can analyze macroscopic material characteristics such as hardness, melting point, and ductility. Various machine learning algorithms, both traditional methods and deep neural networks, can be employed in HEC research. Comprehensive and accurate data collection, feature engineering, and model training and selection through cross&#8208;validation are crucial for establishing excellent ML models. ML also holds promise in analyzing phase structures and stability, constructing potentials in simulations, and facilitating the design of functional materials. Although some domains, such as magnetic and device materials, still require further exploration, machine learning's potential in HEC research is substantial. Consequently, machine learning has become an indispensable tool in understanding and exploiting the capabilities of HEC, serving as the foundation for the new paradigm of Artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;assisted material exploration.

         <title>Rational Designs of Biomaterials for Combating Oral Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intractable oral biofilms are the chief culprits of both dental infections and systemic inflammation, posing a great threat to human health. In this review, core strategies of recently developed biomaterials in eradicating oral biofilm are present. Furthermore, design rationales of biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity, as well as versatile antibiofilm biomaterials with other functions are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Oral biofilms, which are also known as dental plaque, are the culprit of a wide range of oral diseases and systemic diseases, thus contributing to serious health risks. The manner of how to achieve good control of oral biofilms has been an increasing public concern. Novel antimicrobial biomaterials with highly controllable fabrication and functionalization have been proven to be promising candidates. However, previous reviews have generally emphasized the physicochemical properties, action mode, and application effectiveness of those biomaterials, whereas insufficient attention has been given to the design rationales tailored to different infection types and application scenarios. To offer guidance for better diversification and functionalization of anti&#8208;oral&#8208;biofilm biomaterials, this review details the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design rationales in three aspects: the core strategies in combating oral biofilm, as well as the biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity and multiple functions based on the improvement or combination of the abovementioned antimicrobial strategies. Thereafter, insights on the existing challenges and future improvement of biomaterial&#8208;assisted oral biofilm treatments are proposed, hoping to provide a theoretical basis and reference for the subsequent design and application of antibiofilm biomaterials.

         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent advances on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for precision diagnosis and treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are comprehensively summarized. The chemical compositions of LNPs and the modification strategies for enhanced tumor target are introduced. After that, the authors&#8217; ongoing and foreseeable biomedical applications are discussed and prospected.








Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological malignancy and represents a leading threat to healthcare. Recent years have seen a series of progresses in the early diagnosis and management of RCC. Theranostic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are increasingly becoming one of the focuses in this field, because of their suitability for tumor targeting and multimodal therapy. LNPs can be precisely fabricated with desirable chemical compositions and biomedical properties, which closely match the physiological characteristics and clinical needs of RCC. Herein, a comprehensive review of theranostic LNPs is presented, emphasizing the generic tool nature of LNPs in developing advanced micro&#8208;nano biomaterials. It begins with a brief overview of the compositions and formation mechanism of LNPs, followed with an introduction to kidney&#8208;targeting approaches, such as passive, active, and stimulus responsive targeting. With examples provided, a series of modification strategies for enhancing the tumor targeting and functionality of LNPs are discussed. Thereafter, research advances on applications of these LNPs for RCC including bioimaging, liquid biopsy, drug delivery, physical therapy, and gene therapy are summarized and discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective. The final part highlights the milestone achievements of translation medicine, current challenges as well as future development directions of LNPs for the diagnosis and treatment of RCC.

         <title>Geometric Control and Optical Properties of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have provided great opportunities for many promising applications. Here, the geometric control and optical properties of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are circumnavigated and widen the scope of their potential applications. It is envisioned that these studies will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for emerging applications.








Abstract
Intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit intriguing geometry&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties, which is due to the combination of plasmonic features with geometric chirality. Thus, chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have become promising candidates for applications in biosensing, asymmetric catalysis, biomedicine, photonics, etc. Recent advances in geometric control and optical tuning of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have further opened up a unique opportunity for their widespread applications in many emerging technological areas. Here, the recent developments in the geometric control of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are reviewed with special attention given to the quantitative understanding of the chiroptical structure&#8208;property relationship. Several important optical spectroscopic tools for characterizing the optical chirality of plasmonic nanomaterials at both ensemble and single&#8208;particle levels are also discussed. Three emerging applications of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials, including enantioselective sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and biomedicine, are further highlighted. It is envisioned that these advanced studies in chiral plasmonic nanomaterials will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for diverse emerging technological applications.

         <title>The Key Role of Molecular Packing in Luminescence Property: From Adjacent Molecules to Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly discusses the molecular aggregation science behind luminescence materials. From the basic packing modes of adjacent molecules to the various aggregated structures, the efficient bridge between molecular structures and luminescence property has been roughly built to promote their development from internal to external.








Abstract
The luminescence materials act as the key components in many functional devices, as well as the detection and imaging systems, which can be permeated in each aspect of modern life, and attract more and more attention for the creative technology and applications. In addition to the diverse properties of organic luminogens, the multiple molecular packing at aggregated states frequently offers new and/or exciting performance. However, there still lacks comprehensive analysis of molecular packing in these organic materials, resulting in an increased gap between molecular design and practical applications. In this review, from the basic knowledge of organic compounds as single molecules, to the discernable property of excimer, charge transfer (CT) complex or self&#8208;assembly systems by adjacent molecules, and finally to the opto&#8208;electronic performance of molecular aggregates, the relevant factors to molecular packing and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Lightning the Spin: Harnessing the Potential of 2D Magnets in Opto&#8208;Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D magnets provide diverse magnetic orders for spins to be aligned, including intralayer ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and interlayer (A&#8208;type) antiferromagnetism, which allow the spins to precess in a wide range of frequency from GHz to X&#8208;ray. By interacting with the given wavelength of light/electromagnetic wave, the spins can be excited (written) and detected (read), realizing different types of opto&#8208;spintronic devices and functions.








Abstract
Since the emergence of 2D magnets in 2017, the diversity of these materials has greatly expanded. Their 2D nature (atomic&#8208;scale thickness) endows these magnets with strong magnetic anisotropy, layer&#8208;dependent and switchable magnetic order, and quantum&#8208;confined quasiparticles, which distinguish them from conventional 3D magnetic materials. Moreover, the 2D geometry facilitates light incidence for opto&#8208;spintronic applications and potential on&#8208;chip integration. In analogy to optoelectronics based on optical&#8211;electronic interactions, opto&#8208;spintronics use light&#8208;spin interactions to process spin information stored in the solid state. In this review, opto&#8208;spintronics is divided into three types with respect to the wavelengths of radiation interacting with 2D magnets: 1) GHz (microwave) to THz (mid&#8208;infrared), 2) visible, and 3) UV to X&#8208;rays. It is focused on the recent research advancements on the newly discovered mechanisms of light&#8208;spin interactions in 2D magnets and introduces the potential design of novel opto&#8208;spintronic applications based on these interactions.

         <title>A Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayer high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co&#8208;ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high&#8208;entropy material structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites.

&lt;p&gt;A monolayer high-entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co-ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high-entropy material structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high-entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high-entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Preventing Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias Via Local Hyperthermia Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of AIEgen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks are constructed with a unique &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; functionality, which is not only efficient in directly modulating the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy, but also further inducing browning of white fat and ameliorating the neuroinflammation of peri&#8208;SG, favorable for inhibiting malignant ventricular arrhythmias.








Abstract
The engineering of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs), TDTA&#8208;COF, BTDTA&#8208;COF, and BTDBETA&#8208;COF are reported, as hyperthermia agents for inhibiting the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). These AIE COFs exhibit dual functionality, as they not only directly modulate the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy (LHT) but also induce the browning of white fat and improve the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment, which is favorable for inhibiting ischemia&#8208;induced VAs. In vivo studies have confirmed that BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT enhances thermogenesis and browning&#8208;related gene expression, thereby serving a synergistic role in combating VAs. Transcriptome analysis of peri&#8208;SG adipose tissue reveals a substantial downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potency of BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT in ameliorating the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment and offering myocardial and arrhythmia protection. The work on AIE COF&#8208;based hyperthermia agent for VAs inhibition provides a new avenue for mitigating cardiac sympathetic nerve hyperactivity.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Regulating Drug Delivery Nanoparticles for Treating and Preventing Typical Biofilm&#8208;Induced Oral Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most of the infectious diseases in the oral cavity are based on disturbances in the bacterial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. In this work, a microenvironment&#8208;targeted drug delivery nanoparticle is prepared to inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, modulate macrophage polarization, and produce photodynamic and photothermal effects. It performs antibacterial, anti&#8208;biofilm, and anti&#8208;inflammation effects to achieve the treatment and prevention for typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases.








Abstract
The oral cavity comprises an environment full of microorganisms. Dysregulation of this microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment will lead to a series of oral diseases, such as implant&#8208;associated infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilms and periodontitis initiated by Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis). In this study, a liposome&#8208;encapsulated indocyanine green (ICG) and rapamycin drug&#8208;delivery nanoparticle (ICG&#8208;rapamycin) is designed to treat and prevent two typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. ICG&#8208;rapamycin elevates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and temperature levels to facilitate photodynamic and photothermal mechanisms under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation for anti&#8208;bacteria. In addition, it prevents biofilm formation by promoting bacterial motility with increasing the ATP levels. The nanoparticles modulate the microbial&#8208;cellular interaction to reduce cellular inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance, which includes promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages, upregulating the anti&#8208;inflammatory factor TGF&#8208;&#946;, and enhancing the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages. Based on these findings, ICG&#8208;rapamycin is applied to implant&#8208;infected and periodontitis animal models to confirm the effects in vivo. This study demonstrates that ICG&#8208;rapamycin can treat and prevent biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment, thus providing a promising strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow&#8208;Structured Mesoporous Carbons by Enhanced Surface Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons with ultrahigh surface area, large pore volume and heteroatom doping are synthesized by a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method. The materials display remarkable electrochemical performance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The studies reveal that strong interactions between the organic molecules and the silanol&#8208;rich surface of the silica template are crucial.








Abstract
Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK&#8208;5&#8208;like structures that are constructed to consist of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of the template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method to create hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom&#8208;doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2&#8208;thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates is reported. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), large pore volume (4.0&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory lithium&#8208;storage capacity (1460&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (320&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Single&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanomachining for Fabrication of a Uniform Nanochannel Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retention of individual gold nanoparticles on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining, is enabled via a simple and versatile strategy. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single micrometer&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing.








Abstract
The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing.

&lt;p&gt;The retention of individual gold nanoparticles on a substrate, enabling single-nanoparticle nanomachining, is enabled via a simple and versatile strategy. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron-beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single micrometer-long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape-based nanoparticle distinguishing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal-nanoparticle-assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single-nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron-beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter-long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape-based nanoparticle distinguishing. The developed method can also facilitate single-nanoparticle studies and nanomachining for a broad application in materials science, electronics, micro/nano-optics, and catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Lanthanum Oxychloride Dielectric for 2D Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) LaOCl is synthesized by controlling the growth kinetics. Due to the considerable dielectric properties of LaOCl and its dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, the MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with vdW LaOCl dielectric exhibits ultralow hysteresis. LaOCl possesses the tremendous potential to act as an ideal gate dielectric for two&#8208;dimensional FETs.








Abstract
Downsizing silicon&#8208;based transistors can result in lower power consumption, faster speeds, and greater computational capacity, although it is accompanied by the appearance of short&#8208;channel effects. The integration of high&#8208;mobility 2D semiconductor channels with ultrathin high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;) dielectric in transistors is expected to suppress the effect. Nevertheless, the absence of a high&#8208;&#954; dielectric layer featuring an atomically smooth surface devoid of dangling bonds poses a significant obstacle in the advancement of 2D electronics. Here, ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) dielectrics are successfully synthesized by precisely controlling the growth kinetics. These dielectrics demonstrate an impressive high&#8208;&#954; value of 10.8 and exhibit a remarkable breakdown field strength (Ebd) exceeding 10 MV cm&#8722;1. Remarkably, the conventional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) featuring a dielectric made of LaOCl showcases an almost negligible hysteresis when compared to FETs employing alternative gate dielectrics. This can be attributed to the flawlessly formed vdW interface and excellent compatibility established between LaOCl and MoS2. These findings will motivate the further exploration of rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides and the development of more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore nanoelectronic devices.

Properties of LM and its application in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains a leading cause of high mortality and imposes a significant health burden globally. The biocompatibility between materials and the cardiovascular system, encompassing biological safety, modulus matching, and anti&#8208;fatigue performance in dynamic physiological environments, has been a critical challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs. The emergence of liquid metal (LM) offers promising opportunities to develop diagnostic and therapeutic methods that exhibit excellent biocompatibility with the cardiovascular system. In this perspective, the progress of LM applications in contrast agents, nanomedicine, implantable and wearable bioelectronic devices, and bionic materials is evaluated, providing a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth discussion of the role and advantages of LM in CVDs management. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of LM in the field of CVDs diagnosis and treatment are outlined.

         <title>Routes to Electrochemically Stable Sulfur Cathodes for Practical Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state reaction&#8221; mechanism can enable the redox reaction of sulfur to proceed in a solid&#8208;phase conversion manner in liquid electrolytes without the generation and dissolution of polysulfide intermediates at cycling, and therefore is a promising approach to develop high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable sulfur cathodes for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been investigated intensively as a post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion technology in the past decade; however, their realizable energy density and cycling performance are still far from satisfaction for commercial development. Although many extremely high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable S cathodes and Li anodes are reported in literature, their use for practical Li&#8211;S batteries remains challenging due to the huge gap between the laboratory research and industrial applications. The laboratory research is usually conducted by use of a thin&#8208;film electrode with a low sulfur loading and high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios, while the practical batteries require a thick/high sulfur loading cathode and a low E/S ratio to achieve a desired energy density. To make this clear, the inherent problems of dissolution/deposition mechanism of conventional sulfur cathodes are analyzed from the viewpoint of polarization theory of porous electrode after a brief overview of the recent research progress on sulfur cathodes of Li&#8211;S batteries, and the possible strategies for building an electrochemically stable sulfur cathode are discussed for practically viable Li&#8211;S batteries from the authors&#8217; own understandings.

An overview of interface engineering strategies to overcome the limitation of the Debye screening effect for the achievement of high&#8208;performance FET&#8208;based electronic devices is proposed, and their applications in biological environment analysis are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Promising advances in molecular medicine have promoted the urgent requirement for reliable and sensitive diagnostic tools. Electronic biosensing devices based on field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) exhibit a wide range of benefits, including rapid and label&#8208;free detection, high sensitivity, easy operation, and capability of integration, possessing significant potential for application in disease screening and health monitoring. In this perspective, the tremendous efforts and achievements in the development of high&#8208;performance FET biosensors in the past decade are summarized, with emphasis on the interface engineering of FET&#8208;based electrical platforms for biomolecule identification. First, an overview of engineering strategies for interface modulation and recognition element design is discussed in detail. For a further step, the applications of FET&#8208;based electrical devices for in vitro detection and real&#8208;time monitoring in biological systems are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, the key opportunities and challenges of FET&#8208;based electronic devices in biosensing are discussed. It is anticipated that a comprehensive understanding of interface engineering strategies in FET biosensors will inspire additional techniques for developing highly sensitive, specific, and stable FET biosensors as well as emerging designs for next&#8208;generation biosensing electronics.

The most critical challenge for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), one of the primary hydrogen energy technologies, is to achieve decent output performance with low usage of platinum (Pt). Currently, the performance of PEMFCs is largely limited by two issues at the catalyst/ionomer interface, specifically, the poisoning of active sites of Pt by sulfonate groups and the extremely sluggish local oxygen transport toward Pt. In the past few years, emerging strategies are derived to tackle these interface problems through materials optimization and innovation. This perspective summarizes the latest advances in this regard, and in the meantime unveils the molecule&#8208;level mechanisms behind the materials modulation of interfacial structures. This paper starts with a brief introduction of processes and structures of catalyst/ionomer interfaces, which is followed by a detailed review of progresses in key materials toward interface optimization, including catalysts, ionomers, and additives, with particular emphasis on the role of materials structure in regulating the intermolecular interactions. Finally, the challenges for the application of the established materials and research directions to broaden the material library are highlighted.

         <title>Processability Considerations for Next&#8208;Generation Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive set of key performance indicators is proposed to address the limitations of current evaluation methods for the processability of organic photovoltaic materials, aiming to guide academic research and enhance industrial processability.








Abstract
The evolution of organic semiconductors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has resulted in unforeseen outcomes. This has provided substitute choices of photoactive layer materials, which effectively convert sunlight into electricity. Recently developed OPV materials have narrowed down the gaps in efficiency, stability, and cost in devices. Records now show power conversion efficiency in single&#8208;junction devices closing to 20%. Despite this, there is still a gap between the currently developed OPV materials and those that meet the requirements of practical applications, especially the solution processability issue widely concerned in the field of OPVs. Based on the general rule that structure determines properties, methodologies to enhance the processability of OPV materials are reviewed and explored from the perspective of material design and views&#160;on the further development of processable OPV materials are presented. Considering the current dilemma that the existing evaluation indicators cannot reflect the industrial processability of OPV materials, a more complete set of key performance indicators are proposed&#160;for their processability considerations. The purpose of this perspective is to raise awareness of the boundary conditions that exist in industrial OPV manufacturing and to provide guidance for academic research that aspires to contribute to technological advancements.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Topological Phononic Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research of non&#8208;Hermitian physics is in the ascendant and has brought new opportunities for the development of topological metamaterials. This perspective reviews the recent advances in non&#8208;Hermitian topological phononic metamaterials for acoustic wave and mechanical structures. New configurations and mechanisms for skin effect in high&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;Hermitian systems and non&#8208;Hermitian effect for elastic wave metamaterials are worthy of further exploration.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian (NH) physics describes novel phenomena in open systems that allow generally complex spectra. Introducing NH physics into topological metamaterials, which permits explorations of topological wave phenomena in artificially designed structures, not only enables the experimental verification of exotic NH phenomena in these flexible platforms, but also enriches the manipulation of wave propagation beyond the Hermitian cases. Here, a perspective on the advances in the research of NH topological phononic metamaterials is presented, which covers the exceptional points and their topological geometries, the skin effect related to the topology of complex spectra, the interplay of NH effects and topological states in phononic metamaterials, etc.

         <title>In Situ Twistronics: A New Platform Based on Superlubricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The burgeoning field of twistronics has been ignited by the straightforward manipulation of interlayer twist between van der Waals layered materials. This perspective highlights the in situ twisting techniques and the underlying superlubricity mechanism, and exemplifies new promising opportunities arising from the intersection of the fields of twistronics, nanotribology, and micro/nano&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), etc.








Abstract
Twistronics, an emerging field focused on exploring the unique electrical properties induced by twist interface in graphene multilayers, has garnered significant attention in recent years. The general manipulation of twist angle depends on the assembly of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, which has led to the discovery of unconventional superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and nonlinear optics, thereby expanding the realm of twistronics. Recently, in situ tuning of interlayer conductivity in vdW layered materials has been achieved based on scanning probe microscope. In this Perspective, the advancements in in situ twistronics are focused on by reviewing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ manipulating technology, discussing the underlying mechanism based on the concept of structural superlubricity, and exploiting the real&#8208;time twistronic tests under scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is shown that the real&#8208;time manipulation under SEM allows for visualizing and monitoring the interface status during in situ twistronic testing. By harnessing the unique tribological properties of vdW layered materials, this novel platform not only enhances the fabrication of twistronic devices but also facilitates the fundamental understanding of interface phenomena in vdW layered materials. Moreover, this platform holds great promise for the application of twistronic&#8208;mechanical systems, providing avenues for the integration of twistronics into various mechanical frameworks.
