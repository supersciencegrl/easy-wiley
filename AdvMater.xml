         <title>Lock&#8208;and&#8208;Shield Strategy Enables Stable and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Tumor&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield system integrates a nanogel &#8220;lock&#8221; for stable nucleic acid encapsulation with a hybrid membrane &#8220;shield&#8221; that confers homotypic targeting and fusion&#8208;mediated entry. This dual design protects nucleic acids in circulation, enables tumor&#8208;specific release, and achieves efficient gene silencing with strong antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
A major challenge to effective cancer gene therapy is the absence of delivery systems that both protect nucleic acids in circulation and release them efficiently inside tumor cells. Nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by nucleases, cleared from the blood, and poorly internalized due to size and charge. Existing vectors address parts of this problem but remain limited by cytotoxicity, instability, or inadequate tumor selectivity. Here, a lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield strategy integrating a hyaluronic acid Nanogel with a hybrid membrane shell&#160;(Nanogel@hMVs) is reported. The Nanogel &#8220;lock&#8221; physically entraps nucleic acids with high efficiency (81.6%&#8211;89.2%) and incorporates dual pH/redox&#8208;responsive linkers for controlled release under tumor&#8208;associated conditions. The membrane &#8220;shield&#8221;, derived from tumor cell membranes and fusogenic lipids, reinforces systemic stability, preserves homotypic recognition, and mediates fusion&#8208;driven cytosolic entry, ensuring tumor&#8208;selective and efficient intracellular delivery. Nanogel@hMVs remain stable for 30 days, promote efficient uptake with minimal lysosomal sequestration, and silence Survivin. Across DNAzyme, siRNA, and ASO, they consistently produce potent gene silencing and in vitro antitumor activity. In vivo systemic administration yields preferential tumor accumulation, marked tumor inhibition, and prolonged survival without detectable toxicity. Collectively, Nanogel@hMVs establish a robust, safe, and adaptable lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield platform for systemic nucleic acid delivery in cancer therapy.

         <title>Faradaic Reversible Electrodes Enable Programmable High&#8208;Power Hydrovoltaic Energy Harvesting Across Broad Ionic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;current hydrovoltaic device based on mesh&#8208;structured, dual&#8208;functional core&#8211;shell Ag/AgX reversible electrodes achieves Faradaic&#8208;driven ion&#8208;electron transduction and programmable electrical outputs via localized charge inversion, delivering 26.0 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 current density, 3.9&#160;mW m&#8722;2 power density, and stable operation across 10&#8722;6&#8211;100&#160;mol L&#8722;1 ionic environments for versatile self&#8208;powered sensing and energy applications.








Abstract
Harvesting energy from water evaporation through hydrovoltaic devices provides a sustainable approach to electricity generation and decentralized power solutions. However, practical performance remains limited by low&#8208;current outputs (&lt;100 nA cm&#8722;2) and operation restricted to low&#8208;ionic&#8208;strength conditions (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;M). Here, dual&#8208;function, mesh&#8208;structured core&#8211;shell Ag/AgX reversible electrodes are developed to construct high&#8208;current hydrovoltaic devices operable across diverse ionic environments. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed AgX shell mediates redox&#8208;driven interfacial ion&#8208;electron transduction, while the Ag core provides high&#8208;speed electronic pathways, synergistically promoting the efficient conversion of ionic migration into continuous electron flow. Leveraging the localized charge inversion effect, programmable electrical outputs in both magnitude and polarity are obtained further. By co&#8208;designing Ag/AgI electrodes with KI&#8208;based electrolytes, this device delivers a record&#8208;high current density of 26.0 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 sustained over 160 h with power density exceeding 3.9&#160;mW m&#8722;2, &#8776;260&#8208;fold higher current and &#8776;39&#8208;fold greater power than previously reported inert&#8208;electrode&#8208;based systems. Moreover, the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial charge inversion enables tunable ion transport and reconfigurable nanochannel selectivity, realizing programmable outputs over an extensive ionic&#8208;concentration window (10&#8722;6&#8211;100&#160;M) and multiple ionic species. This strategy implements versatile energy&#8208;sensing systems capable of powering electronics and supporting diversified self&#8208;powered monitoring across natural and industrial water sources.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Organic Polymer Dielectrics for Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically examines recent advances in high&#8208;temperature all&#8208;organic polymer dielectrics, focusing on dielectric polarization, charge transport, and electrical breakdown under extreme conditions. It evaluates molecular design, composite engineering, and processing strategies, while highlighting key trade&#8208;offs, emerging machine learning approaches, and practical challenges. Forward&#8208;looking perspectives outline pathways toward reliable, energy&#8208;dense, and industrially scalable polymer dielectrics for extreme environments.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors due to their lightweight, mechanical flexibility, and excellent processability. However, most existing polymer dielectrics suffer from limited operating temperatures, which significantly restricts their application in emerging fields such as electrified transportation, aerospace electronics, and compact high&#8208;power systems, where reliable operation under elevated temperatures and high electric fields is crucial. With increasing device integration and power density, there is a growing demand for polymer dielectrics capable of sustaining high energy storage performance under simultaneous thermal and electrical stress. This review summarizes the latest advances in high&#8208;temperature all&#8208;organic polymer dielectrics and provides fundamental insights to guide molecular design and structural engineering for capacitive energy storage under extreme conditions. While key structural parameters influencing capacitive behavior are discussed, emphasis is placed on the interplay between molecular structure, dielectric properties, and energy storage performance. The advantages and limitations of current approaches to high&#8208;temperature all&#8208;organic polymer dielectrics are critically evaluated. Finally, the review outlines the remaining challenges and future opportunities for advancing the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;organic polymer dielectrics capable of delivering reliable, efficient high&#8208;temperature energy storage.

         <title>Biocompatible Liquid Crystal Elastomer Optical Fiber Actuator for In Vivo Endoscopic Navigation and Laser Ablation Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible liquid crystal elastomer optical fibers achieve a physiological phase transition temperature (37.6&#160;&#176;C) with a waveguide structure, enabling low&#8208;loss light transmission (0.76 dB&#160;cm&#8722;1) and large photothermal actuation (30% contraction) under safe laser power. Integrated endoscopically in vivo, they facilitate controlled navigation, hemorrhage detection, and tumor ablation without thermal damage, offering a mechanically compliant platform for interventions in confined anatomical spaces.








Abstract
Photothermal&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) face critical barriers in biomedical applications: phase transition temperatures exceeding&#160;80&#160;&#176;C risk thermal injury, and free&#8208;space optical actuation fails in confined spaces. Here, a thiol&#8208;ene crosslinked LCE is developed with a biocompatible phase transition temperature (37.6&#160;&#176;C), enabling safe actuation within biological tissues. Through coaxial extrusion, the fabrication of waveguide&#8208;structured LCE optical fibers is pioneered, achieving ultralow optical loss (0.76 dB&#160;cm&#8722;1) and enabling long&#8208;range light transmission and remote actuation via silica optical fiber coupling. Under 808 nm laser stimulation (375 mW), these LCE optical fibers generate 30% contraction strain in 23 s, maintaining maximum surface temperature &lt; 48&#160;&#176;C. Integrated into an endoscopic system, LCE optical fibers replaced rigid mechanical components. Ex vivo characterization reveals their omnidirectional bending capability (94&#176; angular range), while in vivo trials on live rats and rabbits validate their operational functionality in anatomical environments, enabling hemorrhage detection and laser&#8208;steered tumor ablation via controlled navigation. Histopathological analysis confirms no thermal damage at fiber&#8208;tissue interfaces. This work establishes biocompatible LCE optical fibers as a photonic platform integrating photonic&#8208;driven soft actuation and tissue&#8208;compliant adaptability, enabling mechanically safe interventions in confined anatomical environments.

         <title>Nematic and Partially Polarized Phases in Rhombohedral Graphene with Varying Number of Layers: An Extensive Hartree&#8211;Fock Study</title>

Phase diagram of rhombohedral graphene stacks with different number of layers.








Abstract
Rhombohedral (ABC&#8208;stacked) graphene systems with different number of layers feature an abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the superconducting pockets can emerge from &#8208; or close to &#8208; one of the correlated states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of these phases for varying number of layers can be useful to interpret the experimental observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree&#8211;Fock calculations have been performed in the presence of long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions. By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of metallic partially&#8208;isospin&#8208;polarized phases that spontaneously break spin and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can present nematicity, stabilized by electron&#8211;electron interactions, exhibiting rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping, and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin&#8211;orbit coupling proximity effects is studied. The results offer new insights into the role of correlations and symmetry breaking in graphitic systems, which will motivate future experimental and theoretical&#160;works.

&lt;p&gt;Rhombohedral (ABC-stacked) graphene systems with different number of layers feature an abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the superconducting pockets can emerge from - or close to - one of the correlated states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of these phases for varying number of layers can be useful to interpret the experimental observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree&#8211;Fock calculations have been performed in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of metallic partially-isospin-polarized phases that spontaneously break spin and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can present nematicity, stabilized by electron&#8211;electron interactions, exhibiting rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping, and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin&#8211;orbit coupling proximity effects is studied.

         <title>Successive Orthorhombic Distortions in Kagome Metals by Molecular Orbital Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthorhombic distortions in kagome metals break the symmetry required for exotic charge order. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction of NdRu3Si2 reveals successive orthorhombic transitions driven by molecular orbital formation between kagome layers. The frustrated kagome lattice hosts degenerate patterns of kagome dimers whose short&#8208;range correlations produce diffuse scattering. A chemistry&#8208;based framework provides design principles for realizing structurally pristine kagome metals.








Abstract
The kagome lattice, with its inherent frustration, hosts a plethora of exotic phenomena, including the emergence of 3q charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave order. The high rotational symmetry required to realize such an unconventional charge order is broken in many kagome materials by orthorhombic distortions at high temperature, the origin of which remains much less examined&#160;despite their ubiquity. In this study, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a structural phase transition from a parent hexagonal structure to an orthorhombic groundstate, mediated by a critical regime with diffuse scattering in the prototypical kagome metals RRu3Si2 (R = Nd, Pr). Structural analysis uncovers partially ordered bonds between kagome layers in the orthorhombic phases. Accordingly, a short&#8208;range correlated dimer model on the kagome layers reproduces the diffuse scattering, with the short&#8208;range order arising from competing structures induced by the geometrical frustration of the kagome lattice. The observations point to molecular orbital formation between Ru 4dz2$4d_{z^2}$ orbitals as the driving force behind the transition, consistent with ab initio calculations. A framework based on electronegativity and a tolerance factor is proposed to evaluate the stability of the hexagonal phase in various kagome metals, guiding the design of highly symmetric&#160;materials.

         <title>P&#8208;Block Compounds Incorporated into SEI Enable Ultra&#8208;Stable Cell Cycling in Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemically activated NiTe2@NC forms a p&#8208;block matrix as a functionalized sodium metal anode host. In&#8208;situ generated sodiophilic Na2Te and conductive Ni reduce the Na nucleation barrier and establish a bi&#8208;continuous ion/electron network, enabling uniform deposition. Concurrently, Na2Te facilitates formation of a robust, ion&#8208;conductive inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, homogenizing Na&#8314; flux to suppress dendrites.








Abstract
Sodium metal anodes (SMAs) are pivotal for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries but suffer from uncontrolled dendrite growth and interfacial instability caused by infinite volume expansion and a fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed, in which a p&#8208;block matrix is in&#8208;situ formed from NiTe2 nanocrystals onto N&#8208;doped carbon hollow microspheres (NiTe2@NC) during electrochemical activation to overcome these challenges. The p&#8208;block matrix with sodiophilic Na2Te and conductive metallic nickel effectively reduces the nucleation barrier and establishes bi&#8208;continuous ion/electron conduction networks, guiding uniform Na plating. Critically, Na2Te dominates the formation of a gradient inorganic&#8208;rich SEI with high Young's modulus and low Na&#8314; diffusion barrier, significantly enhancing mechanical resilience and ion transport kinetics. Consequently, the NiTe2@NC electrode achieves exceptional cyclability (1,000 cycles at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.79%). When configured in full&#8208;cells with a Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 cathode, it maintains the capacity retention of over 96.1% (103.9 mAh g&#8722;1) after 1,200 cycles at 10.0 C. Critically, the full&#8208;cell maintains superior electrochemical resilience with high discharge&#8208;capacity and &gt;90% retention at low&#8208;temperatures (&#8722;20 and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C), demonstrating exceptional practicality for sodium metal batteries. This work establishes a new paradigm for stabilizing reactive metal anodes via in&#8208;situ&#8208;constructed multifunctional interfaces.

         <title>Mesoporous High&#8208;Entropy Oxides Nanoplatform Decodes Paired&#8208;Plasma Metabolic Fingerprinting of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous high&#8208;entropy oxides (mHEO) nanoparticles with an ordered open channel are synthesized and first used as matrix materials to detect small molecular metabolites. Based on the mHEO nanoparticles&#8208;driven detection, the platform shows high sensitivity, reproducibility, and low detection limits. Paired analysis of plasma metabolites in pancreatic cancer decodes the dynamic metabolic changes and identifies potential biomarkers, enabling precise diagnosis and treatment.








Abstract
Accurate detection of small molecule metabolites in vivo is critical for rapid screening of disease biomarkers and health monitoring. Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;MS) has emerged as a promising platform for metabolic profiling, but its capability is hindered by the limited light absorption and energy transfer of conventional matrix materials. In this work, a high&#8208;efficiency metabolic detection platform based on high&#8208;entropy oxide particles (mHEO) with an interconnected mesoporous structure and tailored compositions is established. Owing to their abundant active sites and excellent light utilization efficiency, the mHEO particles show significantly improved photothermal and photochemical properties with an eightfold localized enhanced electromagnetic field and higher surface temperatures (616&#160;&#176;C) than nonporous HEOs (336&#160;&#176;C). As a result, MALDI&#8208;MS based on the mHEO matrix exhibits high sensitivity, good reproducibility (Coefficient of Variation &lt; 10%), and ultralow detection limits with 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude lower than their endogenous concentrations. Furthermore, the mHEO&#8208;based MALDI&#8208;MS platform is applied to analyze paired arterial/venous blood samples from pancreatic cancer (PC) patients with the assistance of machine learning. Four tumor microenvironment&#8208;associated metabolites are identified as a potential biomarker panel of PC, achieving a robust pancreas&#8208;venous plasma classification, which allows the timely screening and targeted treatment of PC.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Designed BCZT&#8211;SBT Heterointerface Unlocks Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Energy Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
Machine learning guides the design of BCZT&#8211;SBT ceramics that form an atomically thin epitaxial interlayer between perovskite and tungsten bronze phases. This hetero&#8208;barrier suppresses carrier injection while homogenizing polarization, enabling a fatigue&#8208;free performance over 10&#8313; cycles as well as excellent recoverable energy performance. The work establishes a mechanistic route to reliable lead&#8208;free dielectric capacitors.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are attractive for advanced energy storage owing to their ultrafast charge&#8211;discharge capability, yet their practical use is hindered by severe fatigue under repeated operation at ultrahigh electric fields. Achieving fatigue&#8208;free performance therefore represents a key challenge in dielectric design. Here, guided by machine learning (ML), SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) is introduced into Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) to construct a (1&#8208;x)BCZT&#8208;xSBT solid solution. At x = 0.10, the coexistence of perovskite and tungsten bronze phases gives rise to an epitaxial interfacial layer only a few unit cells thick, formed by lattice mismatch. Atomic&#8208;scale analyses reveal that this hetero&#8208;barrier effectively suppresses carrier migration, while the tungsten bronze phase promotes polarization homogenization, together enhancing both voltage endurance and reliability. As a result, 0.90BCZT&#8208;0.10SBT achieves a recoverable energy density (Wrec) of 9.94 J cm&#8722;3 with 92.1% efficiency, and more strikingly, maintains stable performance after 109 charge&#8211;discharge cycles without degradation, enabled by an elevated Schottky barrier. This work not only uncovers the atomic origin of fatigue resistance in lead&#8208;free dielectrics but also establishes a ML&#8208;guided strategy for designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance, fatigue&#8208;free capacitors for reliable energy storage.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Fe Nanoclusters: Unlocking Ultrafast Kinetics, Exceptional Stability, and Unambiguous Mechanism in Faradaic Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nanometer Fe nanoclusters were unprecedentedly synthesized via a universal pore&#8208;mediated vapor diffusion method as the anode for Faradaic capacitive deionization, enabling ultrafast and durable desalination while revealing the unambiguous mechanism of Fe&#8208;based chloride storage.








Abstract
Ultrasmall metal nanoclusters (MNCs, &lt;2 nm) are emerging materials with unique properties, yet synthesizing non&#8208;coinage MNCs, especially high&#8208;melting&#8208;point elements like Fe, Ti, and Mn, remains challenging due to the lack of mild, general strategies, hindering applications such as electrochemical desalination. Herein, a universal &#8220;pore&#8208;mediated vapor diffusion&#8221; (PVD) method is reported to synthesize sub&#8208;nanometer Fe NCs (0.8 nm) within mesoporous carbon spheres, tackling the critical bottleneck issue of faradaic capacitive deionization (FDI)&#8211;a promising approach for mitigating global water scarcity. This approach bypasses high&#8208;temperature requirements and extends to other refractory metals. As a FDI anode, the Fe NC electrode achieves a record salt adsorption capacity of 116.83 mgCl g&#8722;1, an ultrahigh rate of 0.57 mgCl g&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and exceptional stability (86.47% retention after 200 cycles). The sub&#8208;nanometer structure enables ultrafast ion diffusion and stress mitigation, overcoming persistent kinetic and stability limitations in FDI. Through operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and DFT, the chloride storage mechanism is identified as a conversion reaction (Fe NCs + Cl&#8722; &#8652; FeOCl), resolving key ambiguities at the atomic level in Fe electrochemistry. This work provides a versatile synthesis platform for non&#8208;coinage MNCs and atomic&#8208;level mechanistic insights, advancing next&#8208;generation desalination technologies.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity and Low&#8208;Latency Machine Vision via Manipulation of Contact Potential Behaviors at Perovskite Hetero&#8208;Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite photodetectors are promising for advanced machine vision, but struggled by a persistent speed&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off. This work identifies the fundamental domination of transport&#8208;limited mechanism and reconfigures interfacial energetics using polymer&#8208;polarized passive dipoles. The resulting devices simultaneously achieve nanosecond response (23.8&#160;ns) and high efficiency (&gt;88%), enabling high&#8208;fidelity, low&#8208;latency imaging for robotics and autonomous perception systems.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven machine vision is reshaping the industrial perception paradigm, highlighting the critical demands of high&#8208;performance vision hardware. Among various emerging vision techniques, perovskite photodetectors have demonstrated exceptional promise but faced a long&#8208;term trade&#8208;off between external quantum efficiency (EQE) and response time, posing a significant challenge for high&#8208;fidelity and low&#8208;latency vision applications. Here, the transport&#8208;limited mechanism is confirmed to fundamentally dominates response time, and high&#8208;bandwidth and high&#8208;sensitivity perovskite photodiodes are demonstrated by manipulating contact potential behaviors through polymer&#8208;polarized passive dipoles. Specifically, the synergistic incorporation of dipole&#8208;rich molecular modifiers with polar functional groups and electronegative atoms effectively rearranges charge distribution, leading to an increased potential difference and homogeneous potential profiles at perovskite hetero&#8208;interfaces. Accordingly, reduced conduction and valence band offsets facilitate carrier transport and suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. The device simultaneously delivers an impressive bandwidth of 25.7&#160;MHz and a high EQE exceeding 88%, enabling a high&#8208;fidelity and low&#8208;latency imaging of fast rotating motion (&#8776;18&#160;750&#160;rpm) with negligible ghosting. This work provides an effective strategy to approach the transport limit of vision hardware, laying a solid foundation for next&#8208;generation AI scenarios.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Sustainable Recovery of Critical Minerals from Li&#8208;Ion Battery Waste</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid microwave plasma pretreatment transforms mixed battery black mass, enabling complete recovery of critical minerals in mild solvents at room temperature. Plasma&#8208;induced lattice disruption in cathode materials enhances solubility, unlocking a fast, energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable battery recycling. The process simultaneously regenerates anodic graphite.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) recycling plays a vital role in the circular economy by supporting a reliable and sustained supply of critical minerals. Commercial black mass, comprising cathode active materials and anodic graphite from spent LIBs, typically requires multiple energy&#8208;intensive steps for the recovery and regeneration of its critical minerals. Here, we report that a single&#8208;step microwave&#8208;induced plasma pre&#8208;treatment can lead to 85% selective Li recovery in water and &#8776;95% recovery of all transition metals in 1 M citric acid at room temperature. Of the various gas compositions evaluated, H2/N2 demonstrates the highest effectiveness. The synergistic action of H2 plasma, microwave coupling, and localized heating reduces the layered LIB cathode metal oxides to their metallic or lower&#8208;valence oxide forms, thereby enabling their facile extraction in green solvents. The residue consists of anodic graphite, which is regenerated through plasma treatment that reduces defects and decreases the interlayer spacing. The recovered graphite shows excellent efficiency as an LIB anode, surpassing commercial graphite in its activity. While here microwave plasma pretreatment has been explored for LIB recycling, it is a technological innovation that can serve as a versatile pretreatment step for hydrometallurgical extraction of critical minerals. r

         <title>Dual&#8208;Handed Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Polymer Fiber&#8208;Confined and Stabilized Perovskite Nanocrystals in Hydrated Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) composite is achieved by confining perovskite nanocrystals within polymer nanofibers and integrating them into a chiral cellulose nanocrystal framework. The nanofiber confinement enables high photoluminescence efficiency, mechanical robustness, and tunable CPL handedness from a single left&#8208;handed structure for advanced optical encryption applications.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of interest for optical encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.

Importantly, by engineering the reflectivity of asymmetric bilayer architectures, the composite exhibits enhanced dual&#8208;handed CPL emission depending on the viewing direction.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-handed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) composite is achieved by confining perovskite nanocrystals within polymer nanofibers and integrating them into a chiral cellulose nanocrystal framework. The nanofiber confinement enables high photoluminescence efficiency, mechanical robustness, and tunable CPL handedness from a single left-handed structure for advanced optical encryption applications.

         <title>A General Elastomeric Agent to Addressing Embrittlement in High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The brittleness of high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells hinders wearable applications. A commercial SEEPS elastomer is introduced as a general toughening additive that boosts mechanical robustness without sacrificing efficiency. Guided by a toughening parameter for material selection, this work achieved a record efficiency surpassing 16% with an 11&#8208;fold increase in fracture strain and exceptional performance retention under extreme deformation.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) that combine high photovoltaic efficiency with mechanical resilience are critical for wearable devices. However, prevalent acceptors often act as stress concentrators, leading to film embrittlement. A general toughening approach remains elusive. Here, a broadly applicable strategy is introduced using SEEPS, an elastomeric agent with finely&#8208;tailored miscibility with the acceptor to toughen OSCs. A toughening parameter &#951;, derived from dynamic mechanical analysis is defined, that quantitatively correlates with elastomer&#8208;acceptor miscibility with mechanical enhancement. SEEPS induces pronounced secondary relaxations that dissipate strain energy, yielding an over 11&#8208;fold increase in fracture strain. In situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that SEEPS preserves molecular packing and suppresses phase separation under strain. The resulting intrinsically stretchable OSCs retain four&#8208;fifths of starting efficiency after 500 stretch&#8208;release cycles at 40% strain, and sustain its four&#8208;fifths efficiency at 52% strain. This work achieves record&#8208;breaking efficiency over 16% while preserving exceptional mechanical stretchability, offering insights for high&#8208;performance stretchable photovoltaics.

         <title>Sustainable Structural Hot&#8208;Melt Adhesives Enabled by Functionalized Crystalline Lamellae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, recyclable hot&#8208;melt adhesive is developed from renewable materials. It features functional crystalline lamellae that enhance shear strength and enable closed&#8208;loop recycling. The adhesive also provides excellent water and oxygen barrier properties, meeting both sustainability and performance demands for advanced bonding and sealing applications.








Abstract
Conventional hot&#8208;melt adhesives (HMAs) suffer from low shear strength and poor recyclability, limiting their structural applications. Here, a sustainable HMA system is developed from renewable building blocks that combines strong adhesion with closed&#8208;loop chemical recyclability. Incorporating polar functional groups into crystalline lamellae enables efficient stress transfer through rigid domains, achieving a balance between cohesive and adhesive forces. The resulting sulfur&#8208;based polymers exhibit shear strengths above 14.7&#160;MPa on wood and 15.1&#160;MPa on stainless steel, along with excellent oxygen and water vapor barrier properties suitable for microelectronic encapsulation. Moreover, these materials can be fully depolymerized from a mixed materials system under mild hydrogenation to regenerate the original monomers. This work establishes a design strategy for structural HMAs that unifies high performance, sustainability, and recyclability.

         <title>Wood Hydroplasticization Toward Ultra&#8208;Strong and Self&#8208;Densified Complex Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel hydroplasticization method that enables microstructural regulation, converting porous wood into ultra&#8208;strong, self&#8208;densified complex architectures without the need for mechanical hot&#8208;pressing, is reported.








Abstract
Wood has been one of the most widely used sustainable materials for millennia, but its limited mechanical properties and formability have restricted its application in diverse structural contexts. In this study, we elucidate the mechanisms governing the micromechanical behaviors of wood and the strengthening effects achieved through room&#8208;temperature hydroplasticization. This process transforms wood into ultra&#8208;strong, self&#8208;densified structures with customizable shapes, driven by system deformation and energy dissipation. These effects are governed by the interplay between polymer matrix elasticity and interfacial sliding response. Notably, the hydroplasticization method enables the attainment of a high flexural strength (483 MPa), surpassing that of mechanically compressed wood and traditional materials like steel and aluminum alloys. These findings introduce new possibilities for developing complex load&#8208;bearing structures that are previously unachievable with conventional wood.

         <title>Dimensionally Resolved Nanostructures of an Atomically Precise and Optically Active 1D van der Waals Helix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to grow nanostructures based on inorganic helical crystals with long&#8208;range order will enable a platform to realize physical states that arise from chirality. Herein, it is demonstrated that controlled vapor phase deposition of an atomically precise helical crystal, GaSI, into ultrathin 1D nanowires and quasi&#8208;2D nanoribbons. The nanostructures retain the helical and noncentrosymmetric nature of the bulk, absorb in the UV, and manifest nonlinear optical activity.








Abstract
Inorganic freestanding helices are rare and sought&#8208;after for their unusual physical states endowed by chirality. To this end, III&#8211;VI&#8211;VII solids have emerged as a distinct class of ternary 1D van der Waals (vdW) crystals which bear atomically precise helical motifs. However, the physical understanding of the intrinsic and size&#8208;dependent properties of these materials is limited by the lack of synthetic strategies to directly access freestanding nanocrystals in high volumes. Using GaSI as a representative phase, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is presented to grow high yields of ultrathin nanostructures based on this helical materials class. With this strategy, it is possible to grow single crystals of 1D nanowires with thicknesses in the 10&#8211;100&#160;nm range at high temperature conditions, as well as quasi&#8208;2D nanoribbons at lower temperatures. The bandgap of the nanowires is established in the UV region and demonstrates the persistence of nonlinear optical behavior as evidence of the persistence of the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure of GaSI at the nanoscale. Inspired by these results, the effect of the helical nature of GaSI on the electronic structure of hypothetical single chains is probed from first principles and shows the pronounced handedness&#8208;dependent and helicity&#8208;imposed spin polarization at the single helix regime.

Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy
A dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme efficiently eliminates ROS in the atherosclerotic microenvironment and performs anti&#8208;inflammatory capability under ultrasound irradiation. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jianhua Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202420189).

         <title>Engineering Framework Materials in Water Systems for Targeted Ion Extraction and Spontaneous Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through comprehensive analysis of framework materials in ion extraction, osmotic energy conversion, and evaporative energy harvesting, this review establishes interdisciplinary connections centered on ion&#8208;selective transport mechanisms across these applications and identifies critical challenges and knowledge gaps in existing studies.








Abstract
Developing techniques that can extract required salt resources and harvest spontaneous energy from natural water environment is essential to promote the global decarbonization and electrification. Construction of advanced framework materials with intrinsic nanochannels has been considered the most promising solution to implement this technique owing to the specific fluid transport performances in such confined space. However, this design requires a deep understanding of the structural properties of framework material nanochannels in different scenarios, as well as the corresponding construction strategies. Consequently, it is an urgent necessity to elucidate the specific ion capture behavior and fluid transport mechanism in these framework materials to build targeted nanofluidic systems for guiding developments in water related resources and energy acquisition technologies. Herein, the recent advances in ion extraction and energy harvesting based on metal&#8208;organic framework and covalent&#8208;organic framework materials have been outlined, along with the discussion about the nanochannels specificity by combining ions and fluid properties and nanochannel structures. Finally, an outlook to trends, challenges and emerging opportunities is given to foresee the future developments in this important field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on spatiotemporal magnetization modulation in magnetic soft materials. It introduces fundamental components, discusses strategies for spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization in magnetic soft materials, and highlights representative applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics. The outlook section emphasizes future opportunities for advanced magnetization modulation technologies in magnetic soft materials.








Abstract
Recent decades have witnessed significant advancements in the exploration of magnetic soft materials, driven by diverse fabrication techniques and the demands of various applications. This progress can mainly be attributed to the unique properties of magnetic soft materials, including their untethered and low&#8208;latency manipulation characteristics as well as mechanical compliance. Spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is fundamentally crucial in magnetic soft materials, as it governs the magnetic body forces and torques for self&#8208;actuation, as well as the generation of magnetic fields for external interaction. Despite remarkable progress in magnetic soft materials, a comprehensive review focusing on spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is lacking. This review begins by introducing fundamental components of magnetic soft materials and then explores various strategies for achieving spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization. Finally, an overview is provided of the typical applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics based on magnetization&#8208;modulated magnetic soft materials, along with perspectives on future advancements.

         <title>Personal Moisture Management by Advanced Textiles and Intelligent Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in personal moisture management (PMM) through advanced textiles and intelligent wearables, evolving from traditional methods like wicking and evaporation to cutting&#8208;edge innovations such as directional water transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive textiles, and AI&#8208;driven wearables. It also highlights PMM&#8208;enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.








Abstract
As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near&#8208;skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near-skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking-drying and waterproof-breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli-responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long-term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat-based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed-loop, intelligent comfort-health-performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM-enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture-heat transport to guide the co-optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) face challenges from sluggish and unstable oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the air electrode. This review discusses recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, emphasizing mechanisms, performance factors, and design strategies, offering guidance for creating efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) have great potential for efficient and clean power generation, energy storage, and sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish and unstable kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode hinder the R&#8208;PCEC development. Durable H+/e&#8722;/O2&#8722; triple&#8208;conducting air electrode materials are promising for enhancing reaction kinetics and improving catalytical stability. This review synthesizes the recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, focusing on their working mechanisms, including electrode kinetics, lattice and its defect structure in oxides, and the generation and transport processes of H+, O2&#8722;, and e&#8722;. It also examines the required physicochemical properties and their influencing factors. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the latest theoretical frameworks, advanced materials, and regulation strategies, this review outlines the challenges and prospects shaping the future of R&#8208;PCEC technology and air electrode development. Based on these theories and multiple strategies about the bulk triple conducting properties and surface chemical states, this review provides practical guidance for the rational design and development of efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs and related electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Recent Advances in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitous defects predominately account for photo&#8208;instability and open&#8208;circuit voltage losses in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). This review comprehensively presents the underlying impact mechanisms, summarizes the advanced optimization strategies across various functional layers and their interfaces to develop efficient and stable WBG PSCs, and evaluates their performance in semitransparent solar cells, tandem solar cells, and indoor photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top&#8208;cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect&#8208;mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self&#8208;accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross&#8208;sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Upconversion Nanoparticles for Emerging NIR Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special photo&#8208;responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance NIR optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared photons into higher&#8208;energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln&#8208;doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP&#8208;based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.

         <title>Advancements in Carbon&#8208;Based Piezoelectric Materials: Mechanism, Classification, and Applications in Energy Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are systematically categorized based on their structural and functional properties. The mechanisms of stress&#8208;induced charge transfer are elucidated, and their applications are explored across three key domains: piezoelectric catalysis for energy conversion and environmental remediation, piezoelectric biomedical treatments for tissue regeneration and antitumor therapies, and piezoelectric generators and sensors for energy harvesting and advanced sensing technologies.








Abstract
The piezoelectric phenomenon has garnered considerable interest due to its distinctive physical properties associated with the materials involved. Piezoelectric materials, which are inherently non&#8208;centrosymmetric, can generate an internal electric field under mechanical stress, enhancing carrier separation and transfer due to electric dipole moments. While inorganic piezoelectric materials are often investigated for their high piezoelectric coefficients, they come with potential drawbacks such as toxicity and high production cost, which hinder their practical applications. Consequently, carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials have emerged as an alternative to inorganic materials, boasting advantages such as a large specific surface area, high conductivity, flexibility, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Research into the applications of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials spans environmental remediation, energy conversion, and biomedical treatments, indicating a promising future. This review marks the first comprehensive attempt to discuss and summarize the various types of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials. It delves into the underlying mechanisms by which piezoelectricity influences catalysis, biomedical applications, nanogenerators, and sensors. Additionally, various potential techniques are presented to enhance the piezoelectric performance. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies for carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are analyzed, emphasizing their current limitations and potential improvements for future development. It is believed that recent advances in carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials will make a significant impact.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are summarized and analyzed from both their separate advancements and the integrated effectiveness in this review. Then, perspectives are given for valuable guidance for further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage technique supplementary to Li&#8208;ion batteries, attracting much research attention owing to their intrinsic safety, cost economy, and environmental friendliness. However, energy densities for AZIBs still do not fulfill practical requirements because of the low specific and areal capacity, limited working potential, and excessive negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio. In this review, a comprehensive overview of basic requirements and major challenges for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density AZIBs is provided. Following that, recent progress in the optimization of each component and the overall configuration is summarized, and crucial design principles are discussed. Apart from conventional emphasis on each part, especially cathode materials, separately, the comprehensive discussion about the synergistic interactions among all components is conducted. Finally, the outlook and research direction are given to provide valuable guidance for the further holistic development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Synergistic Cooperation of Neighboring Active Motifs in Heterogeneous Catalysts for Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of neighboring active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts, emphasizing how their synergistic cooperativity can be rationally designed to modulate catalytic properties. The discussion centers on the modulation of electronic and geometric structures, categorizing the catalytic systems into metal&#8208;acid (Br&#248;nsted/Lewis) pairs, metal&#8208;base pairs, and metal&#8208;metal pairs. The goal is to provide a systematic overview that offers insights into the design and characterization of next&#8208;generation multifunctional catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate interplay between catalytically active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts has long posed a significant challenge in the design of highly active and selective reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, the synergistic cooperation between neighboring active motifs has emerged as a crucial factor in achieving effective catalysis. This synergistic control is often observed in natural enzymes and homogeneous systems through ligand coordination. The synergistic interaction is especially vital in reactions involving tandem or cascade steps, where distinct active motifs provide different functionalities to enable the co&#8208;activation of the reaction substrate(s). Situated within a 3D spatial domain, these catalytically active motifs can shape favorable catalytic landscapes by modulating electronic and geometric characteristics, thereby stabilizing specific intermediate or transition state species in a specific catalytic reaction. In this review, we aim to explore a diverse array of the latest heterogeneous catalytic systems that capitalize on the synergistic cooperativity between neighboring active motifs. We will delve into how such synergistic interactions can be utilized to engineer more favorable catalytic landscapes, ultimately resulting in the modulation of catalytic reactivities.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of Heterogenous Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Electrocatalysis and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies are systematically discussed in the context of the first shell coordination, the second/long&#8208;range coordination, and the outer microenvironment. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as inspired by natural enzymes are discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) provides a specific model to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect in SACs is how to apply the bioinspired strategies in homogeneous biocatalysis to the design of heterogeneous SACs. The effectiveness of this approach relies on systematic insights in structural characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of both the biocatalysts and the heterogeneous SACs. This review will give a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies will be systematically discussed in the first shell coordination (quasi&#8208;homogeneous metal centers and coordination numbers/species) and the second/long&#8208;range coordination (heteroatoms doping, dual&#8208;metallic sites, nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;site, and metal&#8208;support interaction). Also, the unique non&#8208;covalent interactions and oriented mass/proton/electron transfer channels in heterogenous SACs are highlighted as inspired by the outer microenvironment of biological systems. The practical electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of bioinspired SACs are further discussed by drawing inspiration from hydrogenase, nitrogenase, oxidase, and dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and oxygen&#8208;based value&#8208;added chemicals. The current challenges and future opportunities for the development of bioinspired heterogenous SACs will also be discussed.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in ionic conductive textiles for wearable technology are summarized, with a focus on soft ionic conductors that exhibit skin&#8208;like flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics. Their structures, key characteristics, manufacturing methods, and diverse applications are reviewed. Future challenges in sustainability, wearability, fabrication, and electronic integration are discussed, highlighting their potential in healthcare and interactive clothing.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors, characterized by their inherent flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics, are ideal for intimate applications such as wearable electronics for sensing, energy harvesting, signal transmission, and bioelectronics applications. Shaping ionic conductors into fiber and textile formats (i.e., ionic conductive textiles) to replace the focus on rigid electron&#8208;based conductors heralds a transformative technology in wearable electronics and smart textiles, offering advantages that align with human&#8208;device compatibility, wearability, and sustainability demands. In this review, the category of ionic conductors, the essential characteristics of ionic conductors, the methodologies for the fabrication and integration of ionic conductive textiles, and the diverse applications of these textile&#8208;based soft ionic conductors are summarized. By providing perspectives and raising potential challenges on the future design and development of ionic conductive textiles in terms of sustainability, wearability, fabrication strategies, and integration with electrical systems, this review aims to highlight the potential of ionic conductors as key components for the next generation of wearable technologies and electronic textiles.

         <title>Advanced Electrode Materials for Efficient Hydrogen Production in Protonic Ceramic Electrolysis Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are a promising intermediate&#8208;temperature hydrogen production technology, leveraging high proton conductivity in electrolytes yet constrained by insufficient catalytic activity and interfacial instability in fuel/air electrodes. This review systematically categorizes advanced electrode materials and critically evaluates optimization strategies, including doping, interface engineering, and microstructure control, to enhance their catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) exhibit superior proton conductivity under intermediate&#8208;temperature operation (300&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C), emerging as a promising water electrolysis technology compared to traditional low&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;conducting polymer electrolysis and high&#8208;temperature oxygen ion&#8208;conducting oxide electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and electrode instability in PCECs hinder their large&#8208;scale development. This review highlights recent advancements in PCEC technology, emphasizing its thermodynamic and kinetic advantages, the categorization of advanced electrode materials, and material regulation strategies, including chemical doping, microstructural engineering, and multiphase design to improve their catalytic performance and stability. Additionally, the current challenges are discussed and future research directions are outlined for advanced PCEC electrode materials. By summarizing recent advancements in electrode materials and their optimization strategies, this review provides valuable insights into the rational design of efficient and stable electrode materials, advancing PCEC technology for green hydrogen production.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), covering key aspects such as material development, morphology control, stability challenges, and emerging applications&#8212;including semitransparent OPVs. In addition, future perspectives are discussed to guide the advancement of OPVs toward higher efficiency and enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solar energy is the most promising and ultimate renewable energy resource, and silicon photovoltaic technology has gone through exciting growth globally. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) provide solar energy solutions for application scenarios different from existing PV technologies. The organic PV technology, with the synergetic progress in the past decades, has now reached 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has the potential to empower serious new applications using the unique features of OPV&#8212;light weight, colorful, semitransparent, flexibility, etc. The concise review focuses on recent device engineering progress in OPV technologies. The background of OPV devices and materials, especially recent nonfullerene acceptors, will first be presented; then, in the recent device engineering progress, the focus will be on active layer engineering to control the morphology of OPV, leading to recent 19%&#8211;20% efficiency. The parallel progress in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and sequential layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approaches will be summarized. The transparent OPV (TOPV) devices are of great interest with unique features and provide the broadest design space among all solar technologies. This work reviews the TOPV progress covering the active layer and transparent optical structure designs. The future research directions in OPV are discussed with perspective.

         <title>Progress and Prospect for Conducting Polymer Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) are examined along five lines: classification based on raw materials, dispersion behaviors, fabrication methods, multilevel structure&#8208;performance correlations, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications as flexible and wearable electronics. A deep discussion on the dependence of overall performance on the multilevel structure is presented. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are discussed.








Abstract
The integration of plastic&#8208;like mechanical flexibility and metal&#8208;level electrical conductivity makes conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) find extensive uses, covering from lightweight conductors to wearable devices. Preceding conventional conductors, the additional combination of unique electrochemical activity and biocompatibility guides CPF to promise a new era of fibrous and textile electronics. Intriguing performance of CPFs roots in the intrinsic properties of conducting polymers, but is also highly related to the multilevel structures of chain aggregates. This fundamental structure&#8208;performance relationship deserves a deep discussion to understand the dramatically increasing achievements in both research and products. Herein, the latest research on CPFs is reviewed to introduce their classification, fabrication methods, and performance. Then, the structure&#8208;performance correlations of reported CPFs are presented to understand the dependence of overall properties on multilevel structures. Further, recent developments regarding the microstructural control and performance optimization of CPFs are discussed as well as their frontier applications in wearable systems, energy converters, and biological probes. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are prospected. This review can provide helpful guidance for manufacturing ideally structured high&#8208;performance CPFs for advanced flexible electronics.

         <title>Plaque&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Fluoride&#8208;Free MXene Nanozyme for Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>

This work has developed a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme. ROS&#8208;eliminating and anti&#173;inflammatory capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG under US irradiation are demonstrated on macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is an oxidative stress&#8208;induced chronic inflammatory condition underpinning the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), ultimately resulting in leading mortality rate globally. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered catalysis offers localized treatment for deep&#8208;seated plaques effectively and safely, with demand for targeted delivery and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of sonosensitizers. 2D MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine is garnering attention because of their intriguing catalytic properties of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), yet MXene&#8208;assisted sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) for treating CVDs remains scarce. Here, this study reports a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and US&#8208;responsive MXene termed Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG for alleviating atherosclerosis. US irradiation enhances the capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozymes in eliminating broad&#8208;spectrum ROS and resolving vascular inflammation. Besides, actively targeting lesional macrophages improves their systemic delivery to plaque and further boosts anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy, contributing to &#8776;30% plaque size reduction and a more stabilized plaque phenotype. Notably, etching without hydrofluoric acid renders this nanozyme highly biocompatible. In long&#8208;term biosafety studies, Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG is pronouncedly cleared from major organs and no severe changes of liver and kidney functions are observed. Consequently, this work demonstrates that Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated SCT effectively ameliorates advanced atherosclerosis without inducing severe cytotoxicity, offering promising translational potential of MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine. Besides, it broadens application prospects of MXenes to the biomedical field of treating CVDs.

         <title>Active Fabric Origami Enabled by Digital Embroidery of Magnetic Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.








Abstract
Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, transforms a 2D sheet into a complex 3D structure. However, integrating origami&#8208;inspired designs into active fabrics presents significant challenges, including the large&#8208;scale production of stimuli&#8208;responsive yarns that can be processed using standard textile techniques to achieve intricate origami patterns with high precision and versatility. In this work, the large&#8208;scale fabrication of magnetic yarns featuring high magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength, and flexibility is reported, which is enabled by processing magnetic polymer composites with a series of textile engineering processes. Utilizing digital embroidery, these magnetic yarns are programmed into origami patterns with predefined yarn alignments on flexible fabrics to create various active fabric origami structures that are mechanical durable and functional consistent. These structures can reversibly transform among shapes in response to specific magnetic fields, enabling a range of functionalities such as altering surface roughness, delivering linear actuation, mimicking flower blooming, and providing switchable thermal insulation. The novel active fabric origami provides promising smart platforms across areas as diverse as smart textiles, soft robotics, wearable devices, and fashion.

         <title>Ultrastable Calcium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Strongly Coordinated Electrolyte Derived Bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)&#8208;inorganic (inner) bi&#8208;layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.








Abstract
Calcium (Ca) metal battery is a promising alternative to current lithium battery chemistry due to the high crustal abundance of Ca element and potentially dendrite&#8208;free cycling of high&#8208;capacity Ca metal anodes. However, reversible Ca metal stripping and plating have been hindered by the lack of effective electrolytes and the formation of obstructive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Here a strongly coordinated electrolyte system by incorporating LiB(hfip)4 into Ca[B(hfip)4]2/glyme solutions is introduced. The highly coordinated glyme molecules and B(hfip)4&#8722; anions are ready to decompose into organic rich compounds and CaH2, CaB2O4 nanocrystals in the SEI layers on Ca metal surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that these ionically conductive inorganic particles are embedded beneath the organic&#8208;rich outer layer, thus forming a bilayer SEI configuration. This unique structure facilitates efficient Ca&#8208;ion transfer while preventing further electrolyte decomposition. Effectiveness of this electrolyte is evidenced by the ultrastable Ca//Ca symmetrical cells (over 1450&#160;h with low potentials of &lt;0.5&#160;V vs. Ca/Ca2+ at a high current density of 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the high&#8208;energy Ca//polyaniline full cells (energy densities of above 200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 over 200 cycles), which set new benchmarks in the field of room&#8208;temperature Ca metal batteries.

A high PCE of 18.16% in PM6/Y6:PtAC&#8208;Cl devices is achieved with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;401 h under continuous illumination at MPP tracking and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Modulating self&#8208;aggregation and charge transport in the upper acceptor layer of the pseudo planar heterojunction (PPHJ) is crucial for enhancing dielectric constant and suppressing trap density, leading to efficient and stable organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, a metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is selectively incorporated into the upper host Y6 layer of PPHJ to regulate morphology and fill trap states. There exists a strong chemical interaction between PtAC&#8208;Cl and Y6, which can promote electron transfer. PtAC&#8208;Cl can regulate the self&#8208;aggregation and extend the exciton diffusion length of Y6, resulting in enhanced charge transport and reduced energetic disorder. Consequently, upper layer&#8208;modulated PPHJ devices with PtAC&#8208;Cl achieved a significant power conversion efficiency of 18.16%. The universality of PtAC&#8208;Cl is also demonstrated in PM6/eC9 and PM6/L8&#8208;BO systems, achieving the highest PCEs of 18.79 and 19.30%, respectively. All the improved PCEs are mainly attributed to the enhanced fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc) compared with the controls. Additionally, PtAC&#8208;Cl significantly improves the thermal stability and photostability of the devices, with a T80 lifetime of &#8776; 401 h under continuous illumination with simulated 1&#8208;Sun light and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work introduces the concept of MCA and proposes a practical and efficient method to enhance the efficiency and stability of OPVs through selective upper&#8208;layer modulation in PPHJ with MCA.

A reusable carbon&#8208;gel ink, incorporating cottonseed peptone as a natural mediator, enables cross&#8208;linked ionic polymer networks for advanced conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility. Compatible with direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, it facilitates flexible electronics on polymeric and textile substrates for multifunctional applications, including motion sensing, energy harvesting, and self&#8208;powered pressure detection. Integrated smart e&#8208;textile systems have demonstrated human&#8208;machine interaction for signal translation and robotic manipulation.








Abstract
Soft electronics textiles have garnered global attention for their wearability and promising applications in healthcare, energy devices, and artificial intelligence. Recently, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) technology has shown a growing trend because of its controllability, ease of fabrication, and efficiency. However, the design novelty of printable ink for soft electronic textiles is severely hampered by the intrinsic challenges of integrating printability, conductivity, stretchability, biocompatibility, and durability. Herein, a reusable DIW bio&#8208;carbon gel ink is proposed for printing soft electronic textiles where cottonseed peptone&#8208;functionalized multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CPCNTs) exhibit high dispersibility and reactive surface groups, enabling stable cross&#8208;linking with phytic acid (PA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a strong ionic polymer composite. Encouragingly, the gel ink can be directly exploited to design complex circuits and versatile electronics via DIW printing on both polymeric and textile substrates. The viscoelasticity, mechanical recovery, electric properties, robustness, and stretchable architectures enable it to function as flexible circuits, smart sensors, and renewable generators. As demonstrations, multifunctional applications are presented by real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring, LED lighting, and power generation. Furthermore, this printable gel ink is effectively assembled into an integrated wearable unit for robot manipulation and real&#8208;time gesture recognition, suggesting a significant printing strategy for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Ammonia Cracking Enabled by Strained Heterostructure Interfaces on Ru&#8208;free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the strong metal&#8208;support interaction effect, heterostructured interfaces in a Co&#8208;based catalyst are designed to enable low&#8208;temperature ammonia (NH3) decomposition. The induced tensile lattice strain within the core&#8208;shell structure modulates d&#8208;band center of Co, enhancing NH3 adsorption and facilitating N&#9472;H bond dissociation. Furthermore, the dynamic lattice strain release and restoration mechanism promotes NH3 dehydrogenation and by&#8208;product desorption, effectively optimizing the reaction pathway and ensuring sustained catalytic activity.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) has emerged as a promising liquid carrier for hydrogen (H2) storage. However, its widespread adoption in H2 technology is impeded by the reliance on costly Ru catalysts for low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking reaction. Here, a strained heterostructure Co@BaAl2O4&#8722;x core@shell catalyst is reported that demonstrates catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures comparable to most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity across a range of space velocity conditions, maintaining high conversion rates at 475 to 575&#160;&#176;C and achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 64.6&#160;mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and kinetic studies are carried out to elucidate the dynamic changes of the strained heterostructure interface of Co&#8208;core and BaAl2O4&#8722;x&#8208;overlayer under catalytic working conditions. The performance enhancement mechanisms are attributed to the tensile strained Co surface encapsulated in the defective BaAl2O4&#8722;x, which enhances NH3 adsorption and facilitates the rate&#8208;determining N&#9472;H dissociation. Furthermore, the strain release and restoration during NH3 dehydrogenation enable efficient nitrogen desorption, preventing active site poisoning. This work highlights the effectiveness of lattice strain engineering and the development of synergistic strong metal&#8208;support interfaces between active metal nanoparticles and oxide support to boost low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking.

         <title>Interface Reinforced Tailoring of Quantum Dots Regulates Reaction Trajectory of CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;reinforced regulation strategy is proposed to tailor the activation mode of CO2 in water. The facilitation of directional electron transfer and the interface&#8208;reinforced charge difference of the catalytic site at the CdSe/S/InS QD interface greatly promotes the shift of reaction trajectory of CO2 photoreduction, i.e., the main HCOO&#8722; product for CdSe is transformed into CO for CdSe/S/InS QDs.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is one of the most promising pathways toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. However, the multistep process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion endows the regulation of reaction trajectory from CO2 to specific products very challenging in aqueous solution. Here, it is first disclosed that the anisotropic growth of CdSe&#8722;S&#8722;InS interface in ultrafine heterojunction QDs alters the trajectory of CO2 photoreduction in water, i.e., CdSe/S/InS QDs mainly produce CO while CdSe QDs generate HCOO&#8722;. Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; vs QDs) with a selectivity of &gt;96% in C&#8208;based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H2. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface&#8208;reinforced tailoring of CO2 reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO2 activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.

         <title>Green, Safe, Durable, Printed Fabric Hygroelectric Generators for Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves a green hygroelectric generator with enhanced electric outputs. All chemicals and materials used in the hygroelectric generators are safe for human and environmentally friendly. The device achieves an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at room humidity of 55% through the synergistic effect of ion migration and water absorption.








Abstract
Hygroelectric generators, converting energy from moisture into electricity, have attracted great interest due to sustainable and ubiquitous moisture in the environment. However, it is absolutely necessary to replace the fragile and noxious materials reported previously in the hygroelectric generators before real applications for wearables. Herein, a green hygroelectric generator with a high current density is designed for the first time by printing functional materials that are abundant, safe to humans and environments. By engineering printable hydrogel through the synergistic effect of water absorption and ion migration on the fabric, the wearable fabric hygroelectric generators deliver a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, more than 7 times that of most reported hygroelectric generators. The devices show no performance declination after long&#8208;term storage and bending tests due to the design of stable hydrogel and robust electrode/hydrogel interfaces. Moreover, the devices with cross&#8208;finger structures achieve a facile scalable integration for enhanced electric outputs. Exemplifying applications illustrate the great potential of the printed fabric hygroelectric generators as a direct current power supply for wearable applications. This work sheds light on a novel avenue to design safe and environmentally friendly energy harvesting devices for practical applications.

         <title>Janus Cellular Design Drives Solar&#8208;Powered Spatial Lithium Extraction and Water Co&#8208;Generation from Salt&#8208;Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed Janus cellular solar platform integrates photothermal evaporation, ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;guided lithium enrichment, and flipping&#8208;induced salt removal. The asymmetric lattice, fabricated via high&#8208;resolution printing and functionalized with porous adsorbents, enables simultaneous water harvesting and selective lithium extraction from hypersaline brines, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable resource recovery.








Abstract
Lithium plays a vital role in energy storage technologies, with global demand rapidly increasing. Current adsorption&#8208;based direct lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines holds promise but suffers from low ion extraction efficiency due to sluggish intercalation kinetics and poor selectivity, necessitating repeated cycles that increase water and energy consumption. Here, a Janus cellular&#8208;structured solar&#8208;powered platform (JCSP) is developed for energy&#8208;efficient lithium extraction and sustainable water harvesting. The cellular platform features a symmetrical, multi&#8208;branched cantilever geometry with distinct upper and lower lattice architectures, where the lower lattice is functionalized with titanium&#8208;based porous adsorbents. This rational lattice design and functionalized adsorption interfaces enhance light absorption, sustain evaporative flow, and create an ion diffusion gradient for selective lithium extraction. Its cantilever configuration enables a self&#8208;flipping mechanism, preventing salt crystallization and ensuring long&#8208;term stability in high&#8208;salinity environments. This design boosts water evaporation efficiency to 3.85&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, increases lithium adsorption capacity to 43.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and enhances Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity to 112 and 268, respectively, when treating multi&#8208;ionic hypersaline environment (20 wt% total dissolved salt). The JCSP system demonstrates stable long&#8208;term performance in water evaporation and lithium recovery under extreme conditions, providing a sustainable solution to global water scarcity and rising lithium demand.

         <title>Advancing Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Toward Interface&#8208;Optimized Perovskite Solar Cells: from One to Two</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co&#8208;SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution&#8208;processable third&#8208;generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high&#8208;efficiency inverted PSCs, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on. The combination of different SAMs or so&#8208;called co&#8208;SAM is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge. In this Perspective, the latest achievements in molecule design, deposition method, working principle, and application of the co&#8208;SAM are discussed. This comprehensive overview of milestones in this rapidly advancing research field, coupled with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the improved interface properties using the co&#8208;SAM approach, aims to offer valuable insights into the key design principles. Furthermore, the lessons learned will guide the future development of SAM&#8208;based HSLs in perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Skin&#8208;to&#8208;Muscle Deep Tissue Stimulation System for Muscle Atrophy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The body&#8208;coupled on&#8208;target stimulation (BOOST) system and active releasing muscle stimulation (ARMS) hydrogel for skin&#8208;to&#8208;muscle deep&#8208;tissue penetration of ionic drug molecule and electrical stimulation (ES) is proposed. The &#8220;BOOSTing ARMS&#8221; system enables simultaneous ES and dexamethasone delivery, effectively restoring muscle cells damaged by oxidative stress, offering a non&#8208;invasive approach for treating muscle atrophy.








Abstract
With the rapidly growing global aging population, muscle atrophy affects &#8776;40% of older individuals, leading to severe impairments in daily activities. However, its treatment remains challenging due to adverse effects associated with drug accumulation, the difficulty of delivering drugs specifically to deep muscle tissues, and the inherent limitations of current therapeutic devices that rely on wired connections or battery&#8208;dependent external power systems. In this study, a body&#8208;coupled on&#8208;target stimulation (BOOST) system is introduced in combination with an active releasing muscle stimulation (ARMS) hydrogel, which possesses anti&#8208;drying properties and enables electroactive drug release. The BOOST system enables battery&#8208;free, wirelessly delivered electrostimulation and simultaneous drug delivery from the skin to deep muscle layers by leveraging charge accumulation in tissue capacitance. This in&#8208;body field amplification generates a muscle&#8208;targeted electric field that enables deep&#8208;tissue drug penetration. In addition, when combined with the electro&#8208;responsive ARMS hydrogel containing electrically bound dexamethasone phosphate (Dex) molecules, the BOOST system exhibits synergistic performance, achieving targeted internal electrostimulation and efficient Dex penetration into deep muscle tissue for effective transdermal&#8208;to&#8208;muscle delivery. The simultaneous application of ES and Dex effectively restores muscle cells severely damaged by oxidative stress, mimicking the pathological conditions of muscle atrophy.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Photoactivatable Cobalt(III) Nanoparticles for Photoactivated Metal Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new insights on NIR&#8208;II accelerated prodrug reduction of Co(III) nanoparticles by co&#8208;assembling of a pseudo&#8208;conjugated polymer with Co(III) in the polymer main chain, and NIR&#8208;II phototriggered effective photothermal therapy synergistic photo&#8208;activated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Photoactivated cobalt(III) (Co(III)) complexes have great potential for cancer therapy due to their unique interactions with cancer cells. However, its clinical application remains limited by its high toxicity due to low spatial&#8208;temporal control. Here, a second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) photoactivated Co(III) nanoparticles (NanoCo) is shown. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NanoCo is capable of generating photothermal heat to accelerate the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II). Under hypoxic conditions, NanoCo is 166 times more effective than cisplatin at killing platinum&#8208;resistant A549DDP tumor cells. Notably, when exposed to 1064&#160;nm irradiation, NanoCo becomes 5000 times more effective than oxaliplatin at killing CT26 cells under normoxic conditions. NanoCo accumulates at the tumor site, generating photothermal heat and killing tumor cells under 1064&#160;nm irradiation. Additionally, NanoCo under 1064&#160;nm irradiation triggers immunogenic cell death, further stimulating dendritic cell maturation and inducing anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. The combination of Pt(IV) nanoparticles (HSA@Pt) with NanoCo under 1064&#160;nm irradiation achieves a 99% tumor growth inhibition rate in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents new insights on NIR-II accelerated prodrug reduction of Co(III) nanoparticles by co-assembling of a pseudo-conjugated polymer with Co(III) in the polymer main chain, and NIR-II phototriggered effective photothermal therapy synergistic photo-activated chemo-immunotherapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoactivated cobalt(III) (Co(III)) complexes have great potential for cancer therapy due to their unique interactions with cancer cells. However, its clinical application remains limited by its high toxicity due to low spatial-temporal control. Here, a second near-infrared window (NIR-II) photoactivated Co(III) nanoparticles (NanoCo) is shown. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NanoCo is capable of generating photothermal heat to accelerate the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II). Under hypoxic conditions, NanoCo is 166 times more effective than cisplatin at killing platinum-resistant A549DDP tumor cells. Notably, when exposed to 1064&#160;nm irradiation, NanoCo becomes 5000 times more effective than oxaliplatin at killing CT26 cells under normoxic conditions. NanoCo accumulates at the tumor site, generating photothermal heat and killing tumor cells under 1064&#160;nm irradiation. Additionally, NanoCo under 1064&#160;nm irradiation triggers immunogenic cell death, further stimulating dendritic cell maturation and inducing anti-tumor immune responses. The combination of Pt(IV) nanoparticles (HSA@Pt) with NanoCo under 1064&#160;nm irradiation achieves a 99% tumor growth inhibition rate in a 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. This work is the first to introduce Co(III) complexes activated by NIR-II light for photoactivated chemo-immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of D&#8208;band Center Engineered Amorphous Cathode with Ultrahigh, Superfast, and Wide&#8208;Temperature Zn2+ Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a synergistic design combining an amorphous framework with high&#8208;entropy engineering that unlocks a robust cathode for Zn2+ storage. The dual strategy optimizes electron/ion transport, enabling wide&#8208;temperature operation and establishes a novel paradigm for disordered electrode, enabling an ultrahigh capacity (426 mAh g&#8722;1), superfast rate capability (217 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1), and exceptional stability over 25&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance cathodes for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) requires simultaneously achieving high capacity, fast kinetics, and wide&#8208;temperature stability. Herein, a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach rooted in d&#8208;band center engineering with a high&#8208;entropy amorphous structure (A&#8208;HE&#8208;VSe2) host for Zn2+ storage. This synergistic design, achieved by incorporating multiple transition metal elements (V, Ti, Cr, Nb, Ta) and creating an amorphous structure, critically redistributes the d&#8208;band center. This electronic structure modulation fundamentally enhances intrinsic multi&#8208;metal redox activity and optimizes Zn2+ interactions. Simultaneously, the amorphous framework fortifies the host with abundant active sites and facilitates rapid ion transport. Consequently, the A&#8208;HE&#8208;VSe2 cathode demonstrates a record&#8208;breaking performance, including an ultrahigh capacity (426 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), superfast rate capability (217 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1), and exceptional durability over 25&#160;000 cycles. Moreover, such an electrode exhibits robust wide&#8208;temperature adaptability. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies and DFT calculations reveal that the high&#8208;entropy design not only promotes the zinc ion adsorption energy but also lowers the Zn2+ diffusion barrier, all of which are driven by the finely&#8208;tuned electronic structure. This work demonstrates that rationally engineering the electronic and atomic structure of amorphous hosts via high&#8208;entropy design unlocks superfast, ultrahigh, and thermally stable Zn2+ storage for next&#8208;generation energy storage applications.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Reconfigurable &#8220;N&#8221;&#8208;Shaped Antiambipolar Behavior in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique N&#8208;shaped negative differential transconductance (NDT) characteristics is demonstrated in single&#8208;polymer organic electrochemical transistors through a sequential doping&#8211;redox&#8211;doping process driven by iodide ions. This redox&#8208;driven mechanism enables low&#8208;voltage, ion&#8208;controlled reconfigurability and tunable current modulation, allowing seamless transitions between binary and ternary logic states, thus advancing multifunctional and reconfigurable organic circuit design.








Abstract
&#8220;N&#8221;&#8208;shaped negative differential transconductance (NDT) is crucial for advanced electronic applications, including neuromorphic circuits, multivalued logic, and Logic&#8208;in&#8208;Memory devices. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) offer an energy&#8208;efficient platform for these technologies, yet achieving NDT behavior in single&#8208;material OECTs remains challenging. In this study, the realization of &#8220;N&#8221;&#8208;shaped transfer characteristics in OECTs is demonstrated by combining the p(C4DPP&#8208;T) polymer with a potassium iodide (KI) electrolyte. The emergence of this unique behavior is attributed to the distinctive electrochemical properties of iodide, including its ability to participate in redox reactions and form triiodide species. Notably, this behavior emerges exclusively with iodide ions, while chloride, bromide and several other anions induce conventional monotonic p&#8208;type characteristics. By systematically tuning polymer microstructure, electrolyte concentration, and gate voltage scan rates, the intricate interplay among polymer&#8208;iodide interactions, and charge transport is uncovered, optimizing critical performance parameters such as the peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley ratio and the NDT range. Additionally, how iodine (I&#8722;) concentration effectively facilitates ion&#8208;driven reconfigurability in OECT&#8208;based circuits, enabling transitions between binary and ternary logic states is illustrated. The results highlight an unprecedented tunability of NDT behavior in OECTs and hold immense promise for the advancement of NDT&#8208;OECTs in next&#8208;generation electronic and neuromorphic applications.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Reversible Zero&#8208;Field Diode Effect in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Josephson Junction for Logic Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarity&#8208;reversible zero&#8208;field Josephson diode effect (JDE) with a rectification efficiency of up to 34.1% is achieved in a vertically stacked van der Waals NbSe2/Fe3GeTe2/NbSe2 junction, and a XOR logic gate operation is implemented by using this reconfigurable JDE. This work establishes a new route toward realizing efficient, polarity&#8208;reversible, zero&#8208;field JDE and underscores their potential for 2D non&#8208;dissipative superconducting electronics.








Abstract
With unprecedented energy efficiency and quantum&#8208;ready properties, superconducting electronics drive breakthroughs in quantum processors, ultra&#8208;precise sensors, and beyond&#8208;Moore's&#8208;law computing architectures. While nonreciprocal circuit elements such as superconducting diodes are essential for these systems, the realization of practical devices with robust performance remains a major challenge. In particular, polarity&#8208;tunable superconducting diodes that operate efficiently under zero magnetic field are highly desired for practical applications. Here, a polarity&#8208;reversible zero&#8208;field Josephson diode effect (JDE) is demonstrated with highly sustained performance in a vertically stacked 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic Josephson junction composed of the Ising superconductor NbSe2 and the itinerant ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) layers. The diode asymmetry and rectification polarity are primarily tunable via the magnetic state and thickness of the FGT layer. By optimizing the thickness of the FGT layer, a polarity&#8208;reversible JDE is achieved with a rectification efficiency of up to 34.1%. Furthermore, an exclusive OR (XOR) logic gate operation is successfully implemented using this reconfigurable JDE. The work establishes a new route toward realizing efficient, polarity&#8208;reversible, zero&#8208;field superconducting diodes and underscores their potential for 2D non&#8208;dissipative superconducting electronics.

         <title>High Performing Ambipolar Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Solid&#8208;State Inverters Enabled by Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Side Chains Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record&#8208;high &#181;C* and normalized transconductance are achieved based on DPP&#8208;V&#8208;based ambipolar polymers with hydrophilic/hydrophobic side&#8208;chain integration, with balanced n/p&#8208; type performance in ambipolar OECTs and a high voltage gain of 393&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1 in aqueous electrolytes. Single&#8208;component polymer also enables SS&#8208;OECTs with high transconductance and antiambipolar behavior, achieving a record&#8208;high SS&#8208;inverter gain of 163&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, setting a benchmark for solid&#8208;state bio&#8208;integrated electronic circuits. 








Abstract
Progress in solid&#8208;state organic electrochemical transistors (SS&#8208;OECTs) and complementary circuits is limited by the lack of high&#8208;performance single component ambipolar mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (AMIECs). Herein, two DPP&#8208;V&#8208;based terpolymers, p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05)&#160;and&#160;p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B20) are designed, featuring an ambipolar backbone and tunable integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic side&#8208;chain engineering to optimize mixed conduction. Both polymers exhibited state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ambipolar performance in aqueous OECTs, with p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05) demonstrating the record &#181;C* values of 384.8&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (n&#8208;type) and 691.7 F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 (p&#8208;type), along with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art normalized transconductance of 72.6 S&#160;cm&#8722;1for n&#8208;type.&#160;These exceptional performances are attributed to the synergistic enhancement of electronic mobility and optimized ion capacity. Aqueous inverters based on single&#8208;component p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05) delivered a high voltage gain of 393&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, benefiting from well&#8208;balanced n/p&#8208;type characteristics. Notably, this material also enabled high&#8208;performing SS&#8208;OECTs, which retained strong transconductance and current output, and exhibited typical antiambipolar behavior. Furthermore, single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state inverters (SS&#8208;inverters) achieved a record&#8208;high voltage gain of 163&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, representing the first SS&#8208;inverters based on AMIECs and the highest value reported for SS&#8208;inverter systems to date. These results underscore the effectiveness of the molecular design strategy and highlight the promise of ambipolar polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) for scalable, solid&#8208;state, bio&#8208;integrated electronic circuits.

&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and normalized transconductance are achieved based on DPP-V-based ambipolar polymers with hydrophilic/hydrophobic side-chain integration, with balanced n/p- type performance in ambipolar OECTs and a high voltage gain of 393&#160;V&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in aqueous electrolytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress in solid-state organic electrochemical transistors (SS-OECTs) and complementary circuits is limited by the lack of high-performance single component ambipolar mixed ionic-electronic conductors (AMIECs). Herein, two DPP-V-based terpolymers, &lt;b&gt;p(gDPP-V-B05)&lt;/b&gt;&#160;and&#160;&lt;b&gt;p(gDPP-V-B20)&lt;/b&gt; are designed, featuring an ambipolar backbone and tunable integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic side-chain engineering to optimize mixed conduction. Both polymers exhibited state-of-the-art ambipolar performance in aqueous OECTs, with &lt;b&gt;p(gDPP-V-B05)&lt;/b&gt; demonstrating the record &lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;* values of 384.8&#160;F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (n-type) and 691.7 F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (p-type), along with a state-of-the-art normalized transconductance of 72.6 S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;for n-type.&#160;These exceptional performances are attributed to the synergistic enhancement of electronic mobility and optimized ion capacity. Aqueous inverters based on single-component &lt;b&gt;p(gDPP-V-B05)&lt;/b&gt; delivered a high voltage gain of 393&#160;V&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, benefiting from well-balanced n/p-type characteristics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed chirality&#8208;sensitive photoelectric conversion strategy enables the construction of multifunctional circularly&#8208;polarized optoelectronic logic gates, supporting 9 distinct logic operations with large dissymmetry factors. These devices demonstrate applications in image processing, max&#8208;pooling simulation, and chiroptical signal processing, offering a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation optical computing.








Abstract
Optoelectronic logic gates, key components in optical computing and optoelectronic integration, are promising for advancing computing performance in the post&#8208;Moore era. Nonetheless, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates still depend largely on complex regulation, showing restricted functionality and intricate configuration. Circularly polarized light offers a promising route toward highly integrated multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates with its high&#8208;dimensional optics. However, existing circularly&#8208;polarized logic gates are hampered by insufficient discrimination ability and difficulty in adjusting functionality, hindering their applications. Here, a chirality&#8208;sensitive photoelectric conversion strategy is demonstrated, and based on which a series of circularly&#8208;polarized optoelectronic logic gates are constructed&#8212;encompassing the majority of logic operations. These devices exhibit an photocurrent dissymmetry factor of 1.86, underpinning their application in efficient image processing tasks, including stylization and edge extraction. Furthermore, their utility is extended to simulating max&#8208;pooling and realizing chiroptical signal processing with high recognition accuracy. This work effectively integrates chiroptics and electronics, paving the way for expanding the horizons of optical computing.

         <title>A Soft Actuator with Simultaneous Ultra&#8208;High Actuation Strain and Power Density Under Human&#8208;Safe Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft actuator responsive to mild, human&#8208;safe stimuli (body temperature) is developed, exhibiting a large actuation strain (88%) and high power density (1960&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1). This performance arises from a liquid crystalline network engineered with an ultra&#8208;high preset strain (2000%) and an orientation gradient, enabling simultaneous enhancement of actuation stress and strain.








Abstract
Diverse soft robotic applications, such as wearable devices, haptic interfaces, artificial muscles, and biomedical systems, require soft actuators to simultaneously deliver large actuation strain (&gt;40%) and high power density (&gt;323&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1) in response to mild, human&#8208;safe stimuli. However, no existing soft actuator system has successfully met these combined requirements. To address this critical gap, body&#8208;temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) films are designed with a thickness direction orientation gradient achieved through macromolecular engineering of lightly crosslinked gels during the initial stage of network formation. Using ultrahigh stretch ratios to 2000% and with controlled entropic recovery, the degree of molecular orientation through the film thickness can be established. As a result, the fully crosslinked monodomain LC soft actuator simultaneously provides a high actuation strain of 88% and a high power density of 1960&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 under body&#8208;temperature stimulation, a level of performance unmatched by existing actuators sensitive to mild stimuli. Device&#8208;level demonstrations, including a rotary soft robot and an intelligent safety switch, highlight the actuator's versatility and potential for real&#8208;world integration in next&#8208;generation soft robotic systems.

         <title>Electrically Tunable Friction: From Sticky to Slippery with Ionic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates electrically tunable friction &#8220;from sticky to slippery&#8221; using ionic hydrogels, achieving reversible more&#8208;than&#8208;fifty&#8208;fold modulation without liquid lubricants. An electric field extracts a salt&#8208;rich interfacial layer that dramatically reduces friction. This mechanism powers the first crawling robot and high&#8208;precision manipulation driven solely by electrotunable friction, establishing a new paradigm for adaptive robotic systems.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time regulation of friction from conventional dry states to ultra&#8208;low levels represents a critical strategy for improving energy efficiency and enabling the intelligent design of adaptive systems. Yet, current friction&#8208;control methods typically achieve only modest modulation and often rely on liquid lubricants at macroscopic scales, which impose stringent sealing requirements and limit practical applications. Here, an electric&#8208;field strategy is reported for friction modulation using a polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based ionic hydrogel as an electroresponsive frictional material. During sliding against a metal ball, the friction coefficient (COF) can be reversibly modulated by more than fifty&#8208;fold&#160;under low voltage control (&#8722;30&#160;V to +30&#160;V), without the need for external lubricants. Remarkably, the COF decreases to 0.03 at &#8722;30&#160;V (with the metal ball connected to the negative pole), while at 0&#160;V or +30&#160;V it increases to 1&#8211;2. Mechanistic analyses reveal that positive charging of the ionic hydrogel triggers electroosmotic extraction of a salt&#8208;rich interfacial layer, driving the dramatic reduction in friction. It further demonstrates the first crawling robot and precision robotic arm manipulation powered by electrotunable friction, establishing a new paradigm for adaptive and energy&#8208;efficient robotic and mechanical systems.

         <title>Covalent Dangling of Poly&#8208;Indium&#8208;Phthalocyanine Over Carbon Nanopits as Superior Oxygen Reduction Catalyst for Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalently dangled poly&#8208;In&#8208;phthalocyanine on defective carbon nanotubes distorts In&#8211;N4 symmetry via axial In&#8211;C coordination while enhancing metal&#8208;support interactions. Theoretical calculations confirm this design facilitates O2 activation while lowering *OH desorption barriers, thus yielding excellent ORR activity. Applied to Zn&#8208;air batteries, it delivers 270 mW cm&#8722;2 power density and 865 h stability at 5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents&#160;a cornerstone in renewable energy technologies such as Zn&#8211;air batteries, yet its sluggish kinetics and reliance on noble metal catalysts remain critical bottlenecks. Here, we report an ingenious catalyst configured by covalently dangling poly&#8208;indium&#8208;phthalocyanine onto carbon nanopit defects in carbon nanotubes (InPPc/v&#8208;CNTs). This architecture induces axial In&#8211;C coordination that disrupts the symmetric electron distribution of the planar In&#8211;N4 center and strengthens electronic metal&#8211;support interactions. Theoretical calculations reveal that this distorted electronic environment enhances O2 adsorption/dissociation kinetics while weakening the *OH desorption energy barrier, thereby synergistically boosting ORR kinetics. Benefiting from the tailored electronic structure and optimized metal&#8211;support configuration, InPPc/v&#8208;CNTs exhibits both superb ORR activity and stability, with a half&#8208;wave potential up to 0.90 V vs RHE and a kinetic current density of 42.9 mA cm&#8722;2 (&gt;10&#8208;fold higher than the Pt/C benchmark). Moreover, in aqueous Zn&#8211;air batteries, it delivers a remarkable power density of 270 mW cm&#8722;2 and a discharge stability up to 865 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2. This work transcends conventional catalyst design by unifying defect engineering, electronic asymmetry, and macromolecular stabilization into a cohesive framework, establishing a new paradigm for metal phthalocyanine&#8208;based ORR catalysts.

Here, we report an ingenious catalyst configured by covalently dangling poly-indium-phthalocyanine onto carbon nanopit defects in carbon nanotubes (InPPc/v-CNTs). This architecture induces axial In&#8211;C coordination that disrupts the symmetric electron distribution of the planar In&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; center and strengthens electronic metal&#8211;support interactions. Theoretical calculations reveal that this distorted electronic environment enhances O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/dissociation kinetics while weakening the *OH desorption energy barrier, thereby synergistically boosting ORR kinetics. Benefiting from the tailored electronic structure and optimized metal&#8211;support configuration, InPPc/v-CNTs exhibits both superb ORR activity and stability, with a half-wave potential up to 0.90 V vs RHE and a kinetic current density of 42.9 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;gt;10-fold higher than the Pt/C benchmark). Moreover, in aqueous Zn&#8211;air batteries, it delivers a remarkable power density of 270 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a discharge stability up to 865 h at 5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work transcends conventional catalyst design by unifying defect engineering, electronic asymmetry, and macromolecular stabilization into a cohesive framework, establishing a new paradigm for metal phthalocyanine-based ORR catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Strategy for&#160;Controlled&#160;In Situ Release of IL&#8208;2 from Tumor Spheroids Using a NIR&#8208;II Light&#8208;Mediated Optogenetic Manipulation System</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work, an NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic system using photothermal conjugated polymer nanoparticles is developed for controlled in situ interleukin &#8208; 2 (IL&#8208;2) release from 3D tumor spheroids. This approach enhances IL&#8208;2 secretion and activates NK&#8208;92 cells via specific IL&#8208;2RA upregulation, triggering JAK&#8208;STAT, PI3K&#8208;Akt, and MAPK signaling to improve immunotherapy within a biomimetic tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) is a clinically significant immunotherapeutic agent; its short half&#8208;life and poor targeting specificity in vivo have made controlled in situ release an important area of investigation. However, traditional 2D cell experiments and animal studies cannot fully replicate the real environment of human tumors and are limited by interspecies heterogeneity. Here, a NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic manipulation system based on photothermal conjugated polymer nanoparticles is successfully constructed, enabling the controlled in situ release of IL&#8208;2 from 3D tumor spheroids. Maintaining tumor spheroids at a relatively low temperature (&#8776;40&#160;&#176;C) can enhance IL&#8208;2 release by up to 4.3 times upon irradiation with 1080&#160;nm laser for 30 min. The released IL&#8208;2 further activates peripheral NK&#8208;92 cells, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Additionally, the in situ release of IL&#8208;2 specifically upregulates the expression of IL&#8208;2RA on NK&#8208;92 cells, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;affinity complexes between IL&#8208;2 and IL&#8208;2RA. This process activates multiple signaling pathways, including JAK&#8208;STAT, PI3K&#8208;Akt, and MAPK, for improved immunotherapy. Therefore, this NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic system provides a promising method for the controlled in situ release of important cytokines in the 3D tumor immune microenvironment for immunotherapy.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ammonia Production from Al&#8208;Nitrate Battery via Anodic Al&amp;NO3&#8722; Spontaneous Reaction Driven Cathodic Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Al&#8208;NO3&#8722; catalytic battery, driven by Al and NO3&#8722; spontaneous reaction at anode, is designed to realize power production, and achieve NH3 production at both cathode and anode with &gt; 100% apparent faraday efficiency. The substantially enhanced production rate and Faraday efficiency are due to the CuNi alloy film with tandem catalytic sites after introducing Ni into Cu.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NIRR) offers a sustainable alternative for ammonia (NH3) synthesis, addressing the limitations of the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process. This study introduces a novel aluminum&#8208;nitrate (Al&#8208;NO3&#8722;) battery system that integrates anodic Al and NO3&#8722; (Al&amp;NO3&#8722;) spontaneous reactions with cathodic NO3&#8722; reduction, enabling simultaneous NH3 production and electricity generation. The CuNi alloy films, synthesized via pulse laser confined bombardment (PLCB) technology, serve as efficient NIRR cathodes with tandem catalytic sites, delivering an NH3 production rate of &#8776;58.04 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99.40% at &#8722;1.3 V vs. Hg/HgO. The Al&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery system, incorporating NO3&#8722; in both anodic and cathodic electrolytes, suppresses hydrogen evolution at the anode, and achieves an apparent FE exceeding 100% due to NO3&#8722; consumption for NH3 production through both cathodic NIRR and the spontaneous anodic Al&amp;NO3&#8722; reaction. Extended stability studies indicated continuous operation exceeding 50 h, with peak apparent FE reaching &#8776;183.60%. This system demonstrates a high NH3 yield of over 10.0 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 40 mA cm&#8722;2. The findings highlight the potential of Al&amp;NO3&#8722; spontaneous reactions to drive cathodic NO3&#8722; reduction, offering a sustainable pathway for NH3 synthesis from NO3&#8722;&#8208;rich wastewater while generating electrical energy.

The microporous Ti12 oxocluster&#8208;based MOF MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT exhibits effective charge separation and long&#8208;lived photogenerated electrons persisting for hours, as revealed by spectroscopy. These electrons cause reversible color changes and enable dark H2 evolution and water splitting, demonstrating remarkable electron storage and redox capability, positioning MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT as a promising material for photocatalysis and solar energy storage.








Abstract
The microporous Ti12 oxocluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT exhibits excellent stability and photoactivity, making it highly promising for photocatalysis. Using transient and photoinduced absorption spectroscopies, the behavior of reactive electrons in MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT across femtosecond&#8208;to&#8208;second timescales is investigated. The framework shows efficient charge separation and slow decay kinetics, with photogenerated charges persisting into the microsecond&#8208;second (&#181;s&#8208;s) range and displaying higher yields and slower recombination than benchmark MOFs MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 and UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;NH2. Photogenerated holes oxidize water with an O2 yield of 335&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the presence of electron scavengers. Under continuous irradiation, long&#8208;lived electrons accumulate, further enhanced by a hole scavenger (methanol). Remarkably, these electrons persist over 48&#160;h post&#8208;excitation under argon, accompanied by a reversible white&#8208;to&#8208;black color change. The stored electrons remain redox&#8208;active, efficiently reducing added O2 and methyl viologen. Dark addition of a Pt co&#8208;catalyst to photocharged MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT induces H2 evolution at &#8776;300&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;58&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1), corresponding to an accumulated electron density of one electron per 12 Ti atoms. These results highlight the photocharging properties of MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT and its potential for sustainable photocatalytic applications.

The synthesis of a novel nanoporous graphene (NPG) is reported with biphenylene segments via thermal fusion of 12&#8208;armchair porous graphene nanoribbons grown on gold surfaces. Characterization using STM, AFM, and DFT reveals low&#8208;defect semiconducting behaviour and tunable band gaps. These NPGs are stable in ambient conditions and exhibit selective carbon monoxide affinity, making them promising for sensing applications.








Abstract
The implementation of graphene in semiconductor technology requires bandgap tuning, which can be achieved by chemical doping, geometric confinement in nanoribbons or with the insertion of nanopores and non&#8208;hexagonal rings. The bottom&#8208;up on&#8208;surface synthesis approach in ultra&#8208;high vacuum allows for the synthesis of atomically well&#8208;defined graphene or biphenylene nanoribbons and nanoporous graphene (NPG) structures suitable for device applications. Here, a novel 2D carbon allotrope is synthesized in the form of a functional NPG with periodically spaced biphenylene segments. First, 12&#8208;armchair porous graphene nanoribbons (12&#8208;pGNRs) on Au(111) and Au(788) using 7,10&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;triphenylene (DBDT) molecular precursor are grown. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT&#8208;STM/STS) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) measurements reveal the presence of high&#8208;quality semiconducting 12&#8208;pGNRs. Thermal annealing of densely packed 12&#8208;pGNRs at 550&#160;&#176;C triggers their lateral fusion into diverse NPG structures featuring either graphene&#8208;type or biphenylene&#8208;type junctions. The structural and electronic properties are again characterized by LT&#8208;STM and nc&#8208;AFM in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT shows that while graphene&#8208;type NPGs are direct bandgap semiconductors, biphenylene&#8208;type NPGs manifest a smaller and indirect bandgap. The NPGs are stable upon oxygen and air exposure, and the nanopores feature a noticeable affinity to carbon monoxide, making them appealing systems for chemical sensors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy: Synergizing Cavitation Amplification and Efficient Sonoluminescence&#8208;to&#8208;ROS Conversion for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic therapy strategy that simultaneously amplifies acoustic cavitation and optimizes sonoluminescence&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion is exploited. The developed pH&#8208;responsive nano&#8208;sonosensitizer combines an acid&#8208;activated carrier with an aggregation&#8208;induced emission sonosensitizer, achieving potent ROS generation. This system demonstrates remarkable therapeutic efficacy, significantly inhibiting orthotopic breast tumor growth through enhanced sonodynamic effects.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), as a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality with superior penetration depth, receives tremendous attention. To date, the widely accepted mechanism for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in SDT involves acoustic cavitation&#8208;triggered sonoluminescence (SL), followed by the SL&#8208;activation of sonosensitizers. However, current research on sonosensitizer development primarily focuses on promoting SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion, overlooking the essential role of the cavitation process. To fully unleash the potential of SDT, herein, a dual&#8208;enhanced strategy that harnesses the enhanced cavitation for SL generation and efficient SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion is developed for the first time to realize an all&#8208;around enhancement of SDT. Specifically, the proposed nano&#8208;sonosensitizer, namely MeTTh&#8208;PAE NPs, is released as hydrophobic aggregates with a rough surface in response to an acidic environment, allowing for highly enhanced cavitation&#8208;triggered SL under ultrasound. Meanwhile, as a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecule, MeTTh demonstrates a highly promoted intersystem crossing process at its aggregated state, facilitating efficient SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion. Notably, combining these two fascinating attributes in MeTTh&#8208;PAE NPs results in an excellent sonodynamic antitumor effect in both in vitro and in vivo. This work proposes a novel strategy to fully exploit the potential of SDT and provides valuable insights for advancing the design of nano&#8208;sonosensitizers.

         <title>A Radiotherapy&#8208;Responsive Peptide Hydrogel for Pulsatile Release of mRNA&#8208;LNPs Synergizes with Immune Activation to Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiotherapy&#8208;responsive peptide hydrogel encapsulating mRNA&#8208;lipid nanoparticles (NBSGel@mLNP) is presented, serving as a single&#8208;injection vaccine platform that spatiotemporally synchronizes radiation&#8208;induced dendritic&#8208;cell recruitment with pulsatile antigen release, thereby amplifying antigen presentation and T&#8208;cell priming to generate durable antigen&#8208;specific immunity and prevent tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) is a widely used treatment after tumor resection to prevent tumor recurrence. A major limitation of ART is the insufficient capacity to elicit durable antitumor immunity, typically due to inadequate tumor&#8208;associated antigen supply. Although mRNA vaccines provide a promising strategy to supplement neoantigens, current delivery systems require multiple injections and lack spatiotemporal synchronization with radiotherapy. Here, a radiotherapy&#8208;responsive peptide hydrogel (NBSGel) is first presented that enables radiation&#8208;synchronized pulsatile release of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles (mLNPs). NBSGel is formed by co&#8208;assembling two sulfide&#8208;modified peptides (NapS and BenS) with distinct oxidation sensitivities, yielding stepwise hydrogel disassembly under fractionated radiation. NBSGel@mLNP enables pulsatile mLNP release from a single dose, mimicking multi&#8208;injection vaccination while synchronizing antigen availability with DC recruitment. In tumor postoperative models, NBSGel@mLNP combined with ART markedly amplifies antigen&#8208;specific CD8&#8314; T&#8208;cell responses, reduces tumor relapse by 80%, and prolongs survival, outperforming intramuscular vaccination and non&#8208;pulsatile controls. Tumor rechallenge experiment shows no tumor regrowth in the long&#8208;term surviving mice, confirming a durable anti&#8208;tumor immune memory. This work establishes a materials&#8208;guided paradigm that achieves spatiotemporal synergy between radiotherapy and mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy through pulsatile antigen delivery, providing a clinically viable strategy for preventing postoperative cancer recurrence.

         <title>Performance Constraints of All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells in Low&#8208;Intensity, Low&#8208;Temperature Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are evaluated under low&#8208;intensity and low&#8208;temperature (LILT) conditions relevant to space environments. Distinct loss regimes emerge, where weaker entropic mixing causes halide segragation below &#8776;240 K going along with a strong current imbalance, while poor electron transport in C60 dominates.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (2J&#8208;PSCs) reach the highest power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios, making them promising candidates for space applications. To determine their potential for future deep space missions, this study assesses the performance of 2J&#8208;PSCs under low&#8208;intensity and low&#8208;temperature (LILT) conditions, akin to those found near Saturn, the Asteroid belt, or in eclipse. Temperature&#8208;dependent current density&#8208;voltage (J&#8211;V) measurements under varying solar intensities (AM0, 0.1 AM0, 0.01 AM0) reveal that the 2J&#8208;PSCs, comprising 1.80 eV high&#8208;bandgap and 1.27 eV low&#8208;bandgap perovskites, exhibit significant efficiency losses at lower temperatures and low light levels. In contrast, 1.54 eV single&#8208;junction PSCs (1J&#8208;PSCs) exhibit resilient performance, maintaining or even increasing their power conversion efficiency at low temperatures. The main performance problem of the 2J&#8208;PSCs is then identified as a demixing of the 1.80 eV perovskite due to its high Br ratio at temperatures below 250 K. This demixing at low temperatures leads to a significant increase in ion&#8208;induced performance losses as well as current imbalances between the two subcells in the monolithic tandem. Together, this causes severe S&#8208;shapes in solar cell operation and impedes the operation of the monolithic interconnected tandem solar cells. Notably, these limitations vanish upon heating, leading to a recovery of performance.

         <title>Floating&#8208;Gate Synaptic Transistors for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in FGSTs design for neuromorphic computing. It highlights innovative floating&#8208;gate structures, diverse material systems, and an advanced tunneling dielectric layer, along with their respective roles in enhancing synaptic performances. Finally, it analyzes critical challenges and discusses future research directions toward highly energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing hardware.








Abstract
By integrating nonvolatile memory and processing, floating&#8208;gate synaptic transistors (FGSTs) have emerged as a pivotal platform for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing, overcoming limitations inherent in conventional Von Neumann architectures. These devices utilize a unique floating&#8208;gate layer to facilitate charge storage and manipulation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in FGST device design, focusing on innovative floating&#8208;gate structures, diverse floating&#8208;gate material systems, and advanced tunneling dielectric layers. These innovations have significantly enhanced synaptic performance, including near&#8208;linear conductance modulation, ultralow energy consumption, multilevel storage, extended retention times, and robust endurance characteristics. Consequently, FGSTs achieve remarkable pattern&#8208;recognition accuracy and effectively mimic complex biological plasticity rules. Moreover, their integration into neuromorphic sensory systems for vision, audition, touch, and neuronal behavior enables these devices to conduct high&#8208;fidelity real&#8208;time multimodal and reconfigurable processing. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in scaling synaptic energy to femtojoule levels, enhancing the mechanical flexibility of wearable electronics, improving operational stability, and developing large&#8208;scale synaptic devices array.

     alt="Floating-Gate Synaptic Transistors for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in FGSTs design for neuromorphic computing. It highlights innovative floating-gate structures, diverse material systems, and an advanced tunneling dielectric layer, along with their respective roles in enhancing synaptic performances. Finally, it analyzes critical challenges and discusses future research directions toward highly energy-efficient neuromorphic computing hardware.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By integrating nonvolatile memory and processing, floating-gate synaptic transistors (FGSTs) have emerged as a pivotal platform for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, overcoming limitations inherent in conventional Von Neumann architectures. These devices utilize a unique floating-gate layer to facilitate charge storage and manipulation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in FGST device design, focusing on innovative floating-gate structures, diverse floating-gate material systems, and advanced tunneling dielectric layers. These innovations have significantly enhanced synaptic performance, including near-linear conductance modulation, ultralow energy consumption, multilevel storage, extended retention times, and robust endurance characteristics. Consequently, FGSTs achieve remarkable pattern-recognition accuracy and effectively mimic complex biological plasticity rules. Moreover, their integration into neuromorphic sensory systems for vision, audition, touch, and neuronal behavior enables these devices to conduct high-fidelity real-time multimodal and reconfigurable processing. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in scaling synaptic energy to femtojoule levels, enhancing the mechanical flexibility of wearable electronics, improving operational stability, and developing large-scale synaptic devices array. This paper outlines strategic pathways in materials and architecture to steer the development of FGSTs toward highly efficient, brain-inspired neuromorphic hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Defect Engineering in Ca&#8208;Based Pellets for Durable and High&#8208;Absorptance Solar Thermochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;scale defect engineering is used to create robust CaCO3$\rm {CaCO_3}$&#8208;based thermochemical pellets that resist high&#8208;temperature sintering while strongly absorbing sunlight. Nanoscale precipitates and lattice strain stabilize the reactive matrix, and Mn&#8208;induced bandgap tuning raises absorptance from 2.9% to 78.5%. The pellets deliver an average of 848.3 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ\ m^{-3}}$ over 217 cycles, enabling compact, durable solar heat storage.








Abstract
Solar thermochemical energy storage (TCES) holds immense promise for a carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, its large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;cost implementation is severely hampered by the poor solar absorptance, rapid performance degradation, and low volumetric energy density of conventional calcium carbonate/oxide materials. Herein, a multi&#8208;scale synergistic defect engineering strategy is proposed to resolve this conflict fundamentally. Guided by predictive ray&#8208;tracing models and density functional theory calculations that pinpoint dopant d&#8208;electron effects as the key modulator of optical properties, Mn/Mg co&#8208;doped pellets are rationally designed. These engineered pellets demonstrate a suite of outstanding properties: a dramatic leap in solar absorptance from a mere 3.4% to 78.5%, a 1.54&#8208;fold enhanced thermal conductivity, and exceptional cycling durability. Over 123 cycles, the pellets achieve a remarkable average volumetric energy density of 877.9 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ\ m^{-3}}$ (2.1 times that of the pristine powder), maintaining a high average of 848.3 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ}\ {\rm m}^{-3}$ over 217 cycles. This unprecedented performance comes from a unique multi&#8208;scale defect synergy, where 0D point defects induce beneficial lattice strain, while in situ formed 3D nano&#8208;precipitates strategically pin 2D grain boundaries to suppress high&#8208;temperature sintering effectively. This work not only delivers a record&#8208;performing TCES material but also establishes a promising, theory&#8208;guided strategy for the intelligent design of next&#8208;generation energy storage&#160;materials.

         <title>Molecular Association Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes a universal molecular association chemistry to endow electrolyte solvents with synergistically medium polarity, high LUMO, and low HOMO by dipole&#8208;dipole and weak hydrogen bonding interactions, which facilitates superior high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging performance in Li batteries (68.4% capacity retention at 10C under 4.7&#160;V) via promoting the formation of electrolyte ion aggregate solvation structures.








Abstract
The ideal electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging lithium batteries (VFC&#8208;LBs) should solve two couples of paradoxes: low solvation barriers and high ionic conductivity, high oxidative and reductive stability. A single solvent&#8208;based electrolyte is very challenging to meet this demand because of its strong correlation between energy level and polarity. Here, the study develops a strategy of molecular association chemistry to endow electrolyte solvent with moderate polarity and wide energy level that are key to VFC&#8208;LBs. A descriptor of molecular association energy contributed from non&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed to directionally screen out VFC solvents. In an optimal fluorinated ethylene carbonate&#8208;ethyl acetate electrolyte, the 4.7&#160;V Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811, 2.2&#8201;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) coin cells maintain 68.4% of initial capacity at 10&#8201;C (1&#8201;C&#8201; = &#8201;220&#8201;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). And 400 mAh Li||NCM811 pouch cells (50&#160;&#181;m Li, 4.4&#8201;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 NCM811) exhibit stable cycling at 2.8&#8211;4.7&#160;V over 130 cycles. Molecular association chemistry reinforces VFC capability through inducing aggregate solvation structure and suppressing NiO phase formation. Notably, this molecular association strategy can also be readily extended to silicon@carbon||NCM811 and graphite||LiFePO4 batteries.

         <title>Low&#8208;Threshold Superfluorescence and Phase Dynamics in Quasi&#8208;2D Metal Halide Perovskite Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence reveals ultralow&#8208;threshold superfluorescence between 78 K and 180K in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite thin films, which is further investigated using an ab initio model. Superfluorescence and its phase transitions into amplified spontaneous emission and spontaneous emission are investigated. The findings clarify cooperative emission processes and advance the understanding of superfluorescence in perovskite systems.








Abstract
Superfluorescence (SF) is a cooperative quantum emission process characterized by intense, ultrafast bursts of light, with promising applications in quantum photonics. In solid&#8208;state systems, SF typically requires cryogenic conditions, with quasi&#8208;2D hybrid metal halide perovskites being a notable exception where room&#8208;temperature SF has been reported. However, the mechanisms enabling high&#8208;temperature SF in these materials remain poorly understood, and the distinction between SF and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is often overlooked. Here, SF in hybrid quasi&#8208;2D perovskite phenylbutylammonium cesium lead bromide (PBA:CsPbBr3) is reported with the lowest threshold fluence recorded to date in perovskites, observed across 78&#8211;180 K. The phase behavior of emission under varying temperature and excitation fluence is mapped, identifying transitions between SF, ASE, and spontaneous emission regimes. A simple ab&#8208;initio model has been developed to predict the emission density, correlation, and trace distance for understanding the cooperative phenomena and the unified theory of SF and ASE. The analysis reveals the underlying dynamics that differentiate cooperative from non&#8208;cooperative emission, offering new insight into light&#8211;matter interactions in perovskites. These findings deepen the understanding of SF in solid&#8208;state systems and inform the design of quantum optical materials operable at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Vanadium&#8208;Assisted Epitaxy Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale Bilayer Tungsten Disulfide Ferroelectric Semiconductor Single Crystals with High&#8208;Endurance Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium&#8208;assisted epitaxy strategy is designed to synthesize two&#8208;inch bilayer 3R&#8208;WS2 single crystals. The introduction of vanadium not only increases interlayer coupling to break the formation energy degeneracy between 3R&#8208; and 2H&#8208;WS2, but also promotes parallel steps evolution on sapphire surfaces to induce unidirectional bilayer domains nucleation. FeS&#8208;FETs with high&#8208;endurance and a large write/erase ratio are fabricated due to excellent polarization.








Abstract
Bilayer rhombohedral&#8208;stacked (3R) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with switchable polarization expand the ferroelectric scope and provide a promising avenue to construct low&#8208;power and nonvolatile memory devices. However, epitaxy growth of wafer&#8208;scale 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystals is still on the way due to the challenge of phase structure and domain orientation control. Here, a vanadium&#8208;assisted epitaxy strategy is designed to synthesize two&#8208;inch bilayer 3R&#8208;WS2 single crystals on c&#8208;plane sapphire. The introduction of vanadium not only increases the interlayer coupling to break the formation energy degeneracy between 3R&#8208; and hexagonal&#8208;stacked (2H) WS2, but also promotes the parallel steps evolution on sapphire surfaces to induce the unidirectional bilayer domains nucleation. Ferroelectric semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors with high endurance (more than 105 cycles) and a large write/erase ratio (3.0 &#215; 105) are fabricated due to excellent polarization. This work represents a substantial leap in terms of controlling synthesis and memory device construction of wafer&#8208;scale 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further design of logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips to overcome von Neumann architecture bottlenecks.

         <title>Remote&#8208;Controllable Immune&#8208;Priming Spot Formation Via Nanocomplexed Hydrogel&#8208;Assisted Histotripsy: Immunoasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel immunotherapeutic strategy combines injectable, adjuvant&#8208;loaded hydrogels with externally controlled histotripsy to create immune&#8208;priming sites within tumors. This approach generates millimeter&#8208;sized immune&#8208;activated lesions with flexible, patient&#8208;tailored treatment scheduling, enabling precise immune activation through tumor ablation&#8208;mediated in situ supplementation of tumor antigens, DAMPs, and adjuvant delivery.








Abstract
Immunotherapy, which harnesses the immune system to eliminate cancer cells, offers durable, and specific responses. However, many tumors exhibit &#8220;immune deserts&#8221; &#8212; immunosuppressive microenvironments with low T cell infiltration due to the dominance of suppressive myeloid cells and limited inflammatory cues. Cancer vaccines combining tumor antigens and adjuvants can potentially convert these immune deserts into immune&#8208;active lesions. Yet, systemic administration often leads to adverse effects such as cytokine storms and off&#8208;target immune activation. To address this, we propose &#8220;Immunoasis&#8221;, a spatiotemporally controllable immunotherapeutic system. This platform integrates injectable, adjuvant&#8208;loaded hydrogels with externally triggered boiling histotripsy. The hydrogel enables prolonged local retention of immunostimulatory payloads, while histotripsy disrupts tumor tissues and induces in situ conversion of the gel into nanocomplexes enriched with antigens and adjuvants. This localized activation enhances antigen presentation and promotes T cell recruitment at the tumor site. The tunable nature of the ultrasound stimulus provides flexible treatment scheduling and supports personalized cancer therapy. By establishing immune&#8208;priming niches within the tumor, Immunoasis effectively transforms immune deserts into immune&#8208;responsive microenvironments, enhancing antitumor immunity and improving therapeutic&#160;efficacy.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Nanomotor: H2S&#8208;Driven Cascade Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanomotor integrates photodynamic therapy, mild photothermal therapy, and enzyme dynamic therapy into a self&#8208;amplifying cascade through H2S&#8208;driven metabolic reprogramming.








Abstract
Despite advances in combination therapies for cancer treatment, most strategies rely on modular&#8208;additive designs that lack dynamic molecular cues to achieve intrinsic synergy. Herein, a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanoplatform is introduced that orchestrates photodynamic therapy (PDT), mild photothermal therapy (mPTT), and enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) into a self&#8208;amplifying cascade network through gasotransmitter (H2S)&#8208;driven metabolic reprogramming. It is constructed from an Au2Pt core with a surface functionalized mesoporous silica shell loaded with photosensitizers, encapsulated within a tumor cell membrane (Au2Pt@4sMSN/PS&#8208;TPP@CM). Upon GSH exposure, nanomotors produce H2S to boost diffusive motion, while TPP targeting directs this motility toward mitochondria, enabling efficient mitochondrial accumulation (internalization of &gt;100&#160;nm nanoparticles). Subsequently, mitochondrial targeted H2S releasing&#8208;mediated suppression of oxidative phosphorylation amplifies PDT efficacy; HSP70 downregulation enables mPTT; and hyperactive glycolytic metabolism fuels EDT. Furthermore, these enhanced modalities also interconnect in a positive feedback loop: mPTT&#8208;derived hyperthermia accelerates EDT&#8208;catalyzed oxygen generation for PDT, while mitochondria&#8208;localized PDT further inhibits HSP70 to boost mPTT. Ultimately, these interconnected molecular cues establish an H2S&#8208;driven, self&#8208;reinforcing therapeutic loop that enables effective eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, this study identifies mitochondria as the biological initiator and signal integrator for multimodal therapy, delivering a distinctive paradigm to overcome the limitations of conventional combination therapies.

         <title>Polarimetric Photodetector with Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitivity and Polarity Reverse Based on Quasi&#8208;1D Semimetal (TaSe4)2I/2D MoTe2 Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel (TaSe4)2I/MoTe2 heterojunction architecture achieves four&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude dark current suppression via interfacial band engineering, enabling ultra&#8208;broadband detection with high sensitivity. Furthermore, its unique polarization&#8208;state reversal permits filter&#8208;free dual&#8208;band polarimetric imaging, showcasing significant potential for advanced on&#8208;chip photonic systems.








Abstract
Polarimetric photodetectors, capable of resolving both intensity and polarization states of light, are pivotal for advanced multispectral imaging and target recognition. Examples have been demonstrated for applications such as autonomous vehicle lidar systems and polarization&#8208;based biomedical imaging, where accurate polarization information improves target detection and contrast. However, conventional polarimetric detectors are constrained by complicated optical components and single&#8208;band polarization resolution. Here, a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction strategy is proposed that synergizes the unique optoelectronic properties and giant anisotropy of quasi&#8208;1D Weyl semimetal with 2D semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoTe2, achieving great dark current suppression and dual&#8208;band polarization&#8208;spectrum detection through interfacial band engineering. The (TaSe4)2I/2H&#8208;MoTe2 photodetectors demonstrate high&#8208;performance broadband operation (395&#8211;2200&#160;nm) with a detectivity of 2.1&#215;1012 Jones, responsivity of 40&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and quantum efficiency exceeding 11400%, setting a new benchmark for comprehensive performance in phototransistors. Notably, the intrinsic wavelength&#8208;dependent dichroic inversion of (TaSe4)2I enables the orthogonal polarization response polarity reversal between the visible (532&#160;nm) and infrared (1550&#160;nm) bands. Note that dual&#8208;band polarization imaging is successfully achieved, which can be used for multispectral interference identification. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy by constructing mixed&#8208;dimensional semimetal/semiconductor heterojunctions toward future ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity and broadband polarimetric detectors.

         <title>Polymers for Biomedical Applications: the Quest for Treating Cardiovascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modifications of stents can improve their endothelialization, which reduces the risk for thrombosis and restenosis. Biodegradability ensures no foreign body material remains over time, while shape memory expansion reduces damage to the arterial wall. Finally, advanced processing methods enable personalized treatments. The convergence of all these research fields could lead to improved stents for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide. Current treatments using balloon angioplasty, stents, and bypass grafts still suffer from significant risks of restenosis and thrombosis. This review outlines key research areas where polymers are used in treatments for cardiovascular diseases, highlighting developments from the last decade. Designed to serve both experts and non&#8208;experts in the field, it requires little prior knowledge of the subject. A description of the cardiovascular system, cardiovascular diseases, current treatments, and their limitations are first introduced. After providing a detailed overview of the basic and advanced requirements for new treatments, recent advances in key research fields where polymers are applied to achieve these goals are highlighted. While surface modifications aim to improve endothelialization and/or prevent neointimal proliferation, shape memory polymer stents are intended to reduce damage to the arterial wall upon expansion. Research has also focused on developing biodegradable polymer stents to avoid any remaining material in the artery after healing. Finally, various advanced processing methods enable the production of polymeric personalized stents. By addressing various research areas in a single review, the interplay among them is highlighted, demonstrating that their convergence is essential for optimizing treatments and improving human quality of life.

         <title>Modulating Salt Dissociation and Solvent Immobilization Through Dipole Interactions in Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;functional cationic COF&#8208;LiTFSI filler is incorporated into PVHF&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes, where strong dipole interactions enhance lithium salt dissociation and immobilize residual solvents, thereby facilitating Li&#8314; transport and stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (VDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show great potential for application in solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, their poor ion transport capabilities and uncontrolled electrode/electrolyte interfacial reactions induced by residual solvents limit their overall electrochemical performance. To address these challenges, a LiTFSI&#8208;replaced dual&#8208;functional cationic covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;is strategically designed, denoted COF&#8208;LiTFSI, as organic fillers into poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVHF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) to regulate Li+ transport and electrode/electrolyte interface stability. The introduction of dipole interactions between cationic moieties embedded in the COF&#8208;LiTFSI framework and Li salt significantly enhances dissociation, thereby improving Li&#8314; transport and lowering the activation energy (Ea), while the strong dipole interaction between residual N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and the COF&#8208;LiTFSI framework immobilizes the NMP molecule, markedly enhancing the electrochemical stability of the PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE with a Li metal anode. Consequently, the optimized PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE achieves a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 0.63 mS cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the Li/Li, Li/LFP (LiFePO4), and Li/NCM811(LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) cells equipped with PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE achieve remarkably stable cycling. This work presents a novel strategy to regulate ion transport and interface stability in VDF&#8208;based SPEs by leveraging dipole interactions, enabling high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The dual-functional cationic COF-LiTFSI filler is incorporated into PVHF-based solid polymer electrolytes, where strong dipole interactions enhance lithium salt dissociation and immobilize residual solvents, thereby facilitating Li&#8314; transport and stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface.

&lt;p&gt;Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (VDF)-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show great potential for application in solid-state lithium batteries.

         <title>Senescence Reprogramming Unleashes Tumor Immune Surveillance via Coordinated Gene Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target&#8208;enhanced gene delivery nanoparticle (TEPP) is developed to reprogram tumor&#8208;specific senescence by coordinating P16INK4a overexpression with PD&#8208;L1 knockdown. Through the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)&#160;targeting and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter&#8208;driven expression, TEPP selectively induces senescence in tumor cells, enhances senescence&#8208;associated secretory phenotype (SASP)&#8208;mediated immune activation, and alleviates immunosuppression. In combination with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 checkpoint blockade, TEPP elicits robust anti&#8208;tumor immune responses across multiple tumor models.








Abstract
Cellular senescence can recruit immune cells for tumor therapy through the senescence&#8208;associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by immune tolerance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Reprogramming tumor&#8208;specific senescence through coordinated modulation of P16INK4a and PD&#8208;L1 enhances tumor immunogenicity and alleviates immunosuppression. To achieve this, a target&#8208;enhanced gene delivery nanoparticle is engineered using the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) as a senescence&#8208;specific targeting ligand, combined with a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter and a nuclear localization signal&#8208;microtubule&#8208;associated sequence (NLS&#8208;MTAS) peptide. This system efficiently induces tumor&#8208;specific senescence through cell&#8208;cycle arrest and promotes the chemotactic recruitment of cytotoxic immune cells. In vivo, the nanoparticle induces a robust anti&#8208;tumor response without causing systemic toxicity and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 immune checkpoint blockade in subcutaneous, lung metastasis, postoperative recurrence, and spontaneous tumor models. This study emphasizes the therapeutic potential of reprogramming tumor&#8208;specific senescence to improve targeted gene delivery and immunotherapy outcomes, offering a viable approach for the treatment of immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.

         <title>Flow&#8208;Regime&#8208;Controlled Fabrication of CNT&#8208;Bridged Vertically Aligned rGO/MXene Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Fiber Supercapacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs) are fabricated by flow&#8208;driven wet spinning strategy with precisely regulated flow regimes. The vertical aligned 2D nanosheets are interconnected by CNT, forming continuous conductive networks for fluent ion accumulation and fast electron transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the energy storage performance.








Abstract
The directional construction of electrode frameworks aligned with the transport pathways of ions/electron is critical for electrochemical processes. However, conventional fabrication strategies suffer from bottlenecks such as complex processes, and difficulty in scaling up production. In this work, a flow&#8208;driven wet&#8208;spinning strategy is developed to fabricate carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs). Enabled by precisely regulating of flow regimes, the vertical aligned rGO/MXene nanosheets and CNT&#8208;bridged structure collaboratively establish open porous channels for rapid ion transport, continuous conductive networks for efficient electron transfer, and abundant accessible active sites for enhanced charge storage. Consequently, the CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMF electrode exhibits improved ion transport, exceptional specific capacitance (740 F g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability (98% retention after 30&#160;000 cycles) in H2SO4 electrolyte. The assembled flexible asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a remarkable energy density of 224&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (at 1200&#160;W kg&#8722;1) while maintaining robust mechanical flexibility.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Molecular Regulation of Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncontrolled nucleation and growth in perovskite films often result in defective morphologies, degrading device efficiency and stability. Diphenyl carbonate (DPC) acts as a dual&#8208;functional crystallization regulator, employing synergistic covalent (carbonyl&#8208;Pb2+) and non&#8208;covalent (aromatic &#960;&#8208;Pb2+) interactions to control film formation. Consequently, DPC&#8208;modified PSCs achieve a PCE of 26.61% (certified: 26.21%). Mini&#8208;modules (active area: 14.0 cm2) incorporating DPC also reach 21.24% PCE.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most promising photovoltaic technologies, yet their performance is critically constrained by uncontrolled crystallization, which generates suboptimal film morphologies and abundant defects. In this study, diphenyl carbonate (DPC) is introduced as a dual&#8208;functional molecular regulator that simultaneously governs nucleation and growth in FAPbI3 films. Through synergistic covalent carbonyl&#8208;Pb2+ coordination and non&#8208;covalent aromatic &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions, DPC promotes controlled PbI2 pre&#8208;aggregation to lower the nucleation barrier, while its strong precursor binding retards subsequent crystal growth. This cooperative regulation yields uniform, large&#8208;grain perovskite films with markedly reduced defect densities. Consequently, DPC&#8208;enabled PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.61% (certified 26.21%), outperforming the control devices (23.65%). Scalable mini&#8208;module (14.0&#160;cm2 active area) with DPC achieves a PCE of 21.24%. Furthermore, DPC&#8208;modified devices exhibit outstanding stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h storage under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;3 accelerated aging conditions and after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point tracking following ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocols. These findings establish a generalizable molecular strategy for overcoming intrinsic crystallization bottlenecks, advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward efficient, stable, and scalable deployment.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition of 2D Semiconducting Bi2O2S for High&#8208;Performance Field&#8208;Effect Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the successful low&#8208;temperature growth of high&#8208;quality Bi2O2S nanoplates via MOCVD, achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV and high field&#8208;effect mobility of 227&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Bi2O2S&#8208;based FETs exhibit outstanding on/off ratios, while photodetectors show high responsivity and fast response times, establishing Bi2O2S as a promising candidate for low&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Bi2O2S has emerged as a promising 2D semiconductor for high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) applications, effectively addressing limitations observed in conventional 2D materials, including environmental instability, challenges with achieving optimal bandgaps, and insufficient static power efficiency. However, practical application of Bi2O2S has been hindered by synthesis challenges; previous methods often relied on high&#8208;temperature processes (&gt;700&#160;&#176;C) for precursor sublimation resulting in the formation of undesired phases or solution&#8208;based approaches that compromise material quality. In this work, the growth of single&#8208;crystalline Bi2O2S nanoplates at a low temperature of &#8776;400&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV compatible with Si&#8208;based devices. Fabricated Bi2O2S&#8208;based FETs through this process exhibit excellent electrical performance, with a maximum on/off ratio of 3.6 &#215; 10&#8313; and a field&#8208;effect mobility of 227&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, benefiting from the low effective mass (0.15&#160;m0) inherent to Bi2O2S. Furthermore, Bi2O2S photodetectors display remarkable optoelectronic characteristics, including a high responsivity of 11,577&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, rapid response time in the millisecond range, and a specific detectivity of 1014 Jones. These results confirm Bi2O2S's potential as a versatile semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, offering both BEOL&#8208;compatible low&#8208;temperature synthesis and high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power device capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the successful low-temperature growth of high-quality Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanoplates via MOCVD, achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV and high field-effect mobility of 227&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S has emerged as a promising 2D semiconductor for high-performance field-effect transistor (FET) applications, effectively addressing limitations observed in conventional 2D materials, including environmental instability, challenges with achieving optimal bandgaps, and insufficient static power efficiency. However, practical application of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S has been hindered by synthesis challenges; previous methods often relied on high-temperature processes (&amp;gt;700&#160;&#176;C) for precursor sublimation resulting in the formation of undesired phases or solution-based approaches that compromise material quality. In this work, the growth of single-crystalline Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanoplates at a low temperature of &#8776;400&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV compatible with Si-based devices. Fabricated Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-based FETs through this process exhibit excellent electrical performance, with a maximum on/off ratio of 3.6 &#215; 10&#8313; and a field-effect mobility of 227&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, benefiting from the low effective mass (0.15&#160;m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) inherent to Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Furthermore, Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S photodetectors display remarkable optoelectronic characteristics, including a high responsivity of 11,577&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, rapid response time in the millisecond range, and a specific detectivity of 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Jones.

         <title>Enzymatically Switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing Polymer Conjugate to Coordinate Host Immune Responses in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis is a potent form of immunogenic cell death that orchestrates innate and adaptive immunity. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is developed that selectively induces gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis in cancer cells via chemiluminescence&#8208;triggered lysosomal disintegration. EPIC enhances dendritic and NK cell activation in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. When combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, EPIC boosts cytotoxic T&#8208;cell infiltration and memory T&#8208;cell formation, achieving durable tumor regression.








Abstract
Gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, an immunogenic cell death predominantly occurring in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, is pivotal in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, this dynamic process holds significant potential as an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy. However, its adequate spatiotemporal control in cancer remains challenging. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is reported that selectively triggers chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) in the lysosome in the presence of Cathepsin B, abundant in cancer cells. When exposed to cancer cells in vitro, EPIC generates reactive oxygen species via self&#8208;immolation&#8208;mediated CRET, triggering lysosomal membrane disintegration, followed by activation of the signaling cascade that cleaves gasdermin&#8208;D. Cleaved gasdermin&#8208;D forms pyroptotic pores in the cancer cell membrane, promoting the efflux of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines. When systemically administered into the tumor&#8208;bearing mice, EPIC provokes a robust immune response by promoting dendritic cell maturation and reinvigorating cytotoxic NK cells. Combination of EPIC with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody enhanced infiltration of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells and promoted memory T cells, resulting in a durable remission of established tumors with complete tumor regression in more than half of the treated mice. Overall, EPIC has potential as a nanoplatform with multifaceted advantages for precise and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained, Continuous Jumping of a Light&#8208;Driven Electronics&#8208;Free Insect&#8208;Scale Soft Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a 301 mg soft robot capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics. Coupling snap&#8208;through instability with self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive LCEs yields over 188 nonstop and 800 lifetime jumps, with self&#8208;righting, directional locomotion, sensing, and heavy load&#8208;bearing, advancing long&#8208;lived insect&#8208;scale autonomy.








Abstract
Insects scavenge energy from the environment for self&#8208;sustained operation, and some species use repeated jumping to traverse varied terrain. Such capabilities are desirable for surveillance, disaster recovery, environmental monitoring, and hazardous environment exploration. However, insect&#8208;scale (sub&#8208;gram) robots are typically limited to few jumps due to inefficient integration of energy, actuators, and control. Here, insect&#8208;scale (301&#160;mg) soft robots capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics are introduced. Powered by constant light, a single robot achieves 188 nonstop jumps and accumulates over 800 jumps in a year without diminished performance. This behavior is enabled by self&#8208;sustained, repeated snapping (SSRS), a light&#8208;driven mechanism from a self&#8208;shadowing&#8208;induced feedback loop based on dynamic light&#8211;material interplay. The SSRS exploits snap&#8208;through instability and self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), enabling untethered, perpetual actuation, and the snapping dynamics are investigated through simulations and experiments. Beyond sustained motion, the robot demonstrates self&#8208;righting, directional jumping, obstacle negotiation, hazardous gas sensing, and extreme load&#8208;bearing (&#8776;1700 times its weight), highlighting potential for disaster recovery, confined&#8208;space exploration, and environmental monitoring. This work advances insect&#8208;scale robotics toward fully autonomous, long&#8208;lived micro&#8208;robots.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal (LM)&#8211;2D material composites combine the high conductivity and fluidity of LM with the anisotropic properties and rich surface chemistry of 2D materials, enabling multifunctional performance in advanced electronics. This review summarizes recent advances in modification, structure, properties, and subsequently discusses current challenges and future prospects for next&#8208;generation multifunctional LM&#8211;2D material composites.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of high&#8208;integration electronics demands materials that unify thermal, electrical, and mechanical functionalities. Liquid metals (LMs) exhibit exceptional conductivity and self&#8208;healing capabilities, but their intrinsic fluidity poses leakage risks. Incorporation with 2D materials yields LM&#8211;2D material composites with enhanced structural stability and multifunctional integration. This review systematically summarizes: 1) interfacial enhancement strategies (oxidation, heterometallic doping, polymer grafting, mechanochemistry) to improve wettability and dispersion; 2) representative structural designs, including blended, core&#8211;shell, layered, and 3D networks supported by elastomers or hydrogels; 3) key properties across different structural types, such as mechanical robustness, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity; 4) multifunctional applications enabled by enabled by property synergy, spanning thermal&#8211;mechanical coupling (thermal management), electrical&#8211;mechanical coupling (electromagnetic interference shielding, wearable sensors, and energy storage electrodes), and electrical&#8211;thermal&#8211;mechanical coupling (multifunctional films). Despite significant progress, critical challenges remain in scalable fabrication, long&#8208;term reliability, and efficient recycling. To address these challenges, this review further discusses emerging directions for LM&#8211;2D material composites, including novel composite systems, responsive smart materials, multiscale manufacturing technologies, and AI&#8208;assisted design, aiming to provide a roadmap for their development in next&#8208;generation electronic applications.

         <title>Emergent Global&#8208;Pinning Exchange Bias in van der Waals Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an emergent global&#8208;pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of diverse 2D vdW magnets, achieving long&#8208;range magnetic pinning up to 100&#160;&#181;m via simply partial stacking. By tuning interlayer coupling and coverage ratio, it offers a scalable approach for energy&#8208;efficient spintronic memory devices based on 2D vdW materials.








Abstract
As magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technology becomes increasingly vital for emerging applications, such as artificial intelligence, the development of cost&#8208;effective and miniaturized solutions is essential. van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which can be vertically stacked with various functional blocks, offer promising potential to enhance the performance and scalability of memory devices. Nevertheless, the need for perfect alignment between adjacent layers and finite local interactions at the interfaces often complicates device architectures and leads to high power consumption. Addressing these challenges, a new device configuration with partial overlap while maintaining the global effect would be a promising scheme. Here, using Fe3GeTe2/MnBi2Te4 (FGT/MBT) as a paradigm, the global&#8208;pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect is successfully achieved with a horizontal pinning distance approaching 100 &#181;m. Specifically, once stacking a small&#8208;area MBT on FGT, the entire FGT is fully biased due to magnetic couplings inherent to vdW magnets, as confirmed by the theoretical model.

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates an emergent global-pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of diverse 2D vdW magnets, achieving long-range magnetic pinning up to 100&#160;&#181;m via simply partial stacking. By tuning interlayer coupling and coverage ratio, it offers a scalable approach for energy-efficient spintronic memory devices based on 2D vdW materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technology becomes increasingly vital for emerging applications, such as artificial intelligence, the development of cost-effective and miniaturized solutions is essential. van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which can be vertically stacked with various functional blocks, offer promising potential to enhance the performance and scalability of memory devices. Nevertheless, the need for perfect alignment between adjacent layers and finite local interactions at the interfaces often complicates device architectures and leads to high power consumption. Addressing these challenges, a new device configuration with partial overlap while maintaining the global effect would be a promising scheme. Here, using Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MnBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (FGT/MBT) as a paradigm, the global-pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect is successfully achieved with a horizontal pinning distance approaching 100 &#181;m. Specifically, once stacking a small-area MBT on FGT, the entire FGT is fully biased due to magnetic couplings inherent to vdW magnets, as confirmed by the theoretical model. Interlayer coupling and coverage ratio provide additional degrees of freedom to manipulate the GPEB. Remarkably, this emergent GPEB effect is prevalent across vdW heterostructures composed of various vdW magnets. This work expands design flexibility and offers strategies for constructing new in-memory computing devices, opening exciting possibilities for future spintronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocompatible Ink Optimization Enables Functional Volumetric Bioprinting With Xolography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xolography's reliance on weak&#8208;base co&#8208;initiators introduces unique biochemical constraints. By dissecting the effects of extracellular pH, osmolality, and lysosomotropic stress, this study defines the biochemical design space that enables fully biocompatible, cell&#8208;laden volumetric printing.








Abstract
Xolography is a novel linear volumetric manufacturing technique that offers unparalleled precision and speed. Yet, its application to bioprinting remains limited due to insufficient understanding of biocompatibility constraints. Here, this work establishes fundamental design principles for cell&#8208;compatible Xolography bioinks by dissecting the effects of extracellular pH, osmolality, and lysosomotropic stress on cell viability and function. By systematically studying the tolerances for these parameters, this work defines a framework for bioink formulations that enables fast, support&#8208;free fabrication of complex designs with maintained cell viability and function as validated in different murine and human cell lines, primary human cells and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)&#8208;derived cells. These results show that, unlike triethanolamine, BisTris indeed can function as a fully biocompatible co&#8208;initiator enabling cell viability beyond 90% as well as uncompromised metabolic activity and differentiation performance when used in a tightly controlled formulation, contrasting previous reports. This work showcases the biomedical potential of the formulation by achieving fibroblast&#8208;driven extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, endothelial sprouting from pre&#8208;vascularized spheroids, and maintenance of an iPSC&#8208;derived hepatocyte differentiation phenotype within Xolography&#8208;printed constructs. These advancements transform Xolography into a powerful and foremost reliable bioprinting platform for fabrication of complex, cell&#8208;laden structures for versatile applications in tissue engineering, organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models, and regenerative medicine.

         <title>Advanced Design and Characterization of Polyether&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyether solid electrolytes possess strong lithium&#8208;salt solvation ability and flexible interfacial contact, yet suffer from sluggish ion transport and poor interfacial stability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cells. This review integrates multicomponent and structural tuning strategies, illustrates structure&#8211;property insights via multiscale characterizations, benchmarks pouch&#8208;cell performance, and outlines the scalability and consistency challenges facing commercialization.








Abstract
Polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential in lithium batteries due to their excellent interfacial flexibility and high solvation ability for lithium salts. However, the problems of limited ion transport and insufficient interfacial stability have restricted the application of polyether&#8208;based electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#160;batteries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored a variety of strategies, such as multi&#8208;component compounding and structural regulation, and developed a vast array of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Therefore, this review first summarizes the key modification strategies and representative examples of electrolytes from a systematic design perspective, aiming at the two aforementioned major issues. Meanwhile, to precisely implement the above strategies and to design more effective modification strategies, latent yet valuable structure&#8211;property relationships should be further uncovered. Thus, multiscale characterizations are rationally integrated through representative case studies. Finally, it summarizes the reported performance of representative polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state pouch cells, emphasizes scale&#8208;up and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency, and outlines future research directions for translating these electrolytes into high&#8208;energy, market&#8208;ready batteries.

         <title>Ultrathin Monatomic Antimony Films by Sacrificial Atomic Layer Deposition for Phase Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step sacrificial atomic layer deposition (s&#8208;ALD) process enables wafer&#8208;scale growth of ultrathin and uniform antimony (Sb) thin films. An ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) Sb film is uniformly deposited with its characteristic bilayer structure (Sb&#8208;Sb) aligned along the substrate. The excellent surface coverage of the s&#8208;ALD allows facile electrical conduction even in the few&#8208;nanometer thickness range.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb) is an intriguing material for advanced electronics, with thickness&#8208;dependent properties at the nanoscale offering new functionalities. However, conventional methods for depositing Sb thin films cannot produce continuous ultrathin films with conformality in complex nanoscale structures. This study introduces a novel sacrificial atomic layer deposition (s&#8208;ALD) approach that overcomes these limitations by using chemical substitution between the antimony precursor and the pre&#8208;deposited Sb2Te3. The structural similarity between Sb2Te3 and Sb enables local epitaxial growth of a uniform, (00l)&#8208;oriented Sb film with exceptional surface smoothness (root&#8208;mean&#8208;squared roughness &lt;&lt; 1 nm) at a 4&#8208;nm thickness. Highly pure Sb films with excellent wafer&#8208;scale uniformity and conformality are achieved on high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. The mechanism involves substitution reactions driven by the preferential Te&#8208;(CH3)3Si bonding, along with enhanced atomic diffusion through the aligned crystal structure. Phase change memory devices using 5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick s&#8208;ALD Sb films demonstrate ultrafast switching with femtosecond laser pulses (&#8776;220 fs) with high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity (coefficient of variation &lt; 5 %) and ultralow drift coefficients (0.0013 for the on state and 0.0073 for the off state). This s&#8208;ALD technique offers a promising pathway for depositing ultrathin, uniform Sb films, enabling full utilization of Sb's unique nanoscale properties.

         <title>Constructing Highly Durable Fuel Cell Catalysts Through Integrating Graphitic Shell&#8208;Protected Composite Carbon Support with Gaseous Co Deposition&#8208;Driven PtCo Intermetallics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy is developed to design high&#8208;performance Pt3Co intermetallic catalysts by regulating gaseous Co&#8208;driven diffusion into finely dispersed Pt nanoparticles supported on a ZIF&#8208;8/polyaniline&#8208;derived core&#8208;shell structured composite carbon support. The corresponding PGM catalysts simultaneously achieved exceptional carbon support and catalyst stabilities owing to highly ordered PtCo intermetallic nanoparticles covered with a thin carbon layer, which are well&#8208;dispersed on the unique composite carbon support.








Abstract
Metal dissolution, nanoparticle agglomeration, and carbon support corrosion cause significant performance degradation of current PtCo catalysts under acidic and oxidative oxygen reduction reaction. Here, an integrated strategy is presented to design high&#8208;performance Pt3Co intermetallic catalysts by regulating gaseous Co deposition&#8208;driven diffusion into Pt nanoparticles supported on a composite carbon. The composite carbon is derived from ZIF&#8208;8/polyaniline, consisting of a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area (HSC) core and a protective graphitic shell (GS), which is employed to design 40&#160;wt.% Pt/HSC@GS catalyst. The corresponding membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) can maintain 1.09 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V (20. 7% loss) after 10&#160;000 cycles (1.0&#8211;1.5&#160;V for carbon stability) and 1.15 A cm&#8722;2 (16.1% loss) after 150&#160;000 cycles (0.60&#8211;0.95&#160;V for catalyst stability). A ordered Pt3Co intermetallic is synthesized via a gaseous Co&#8208;deposition process, which yields a homogeneous Co&#8208;rich layer onto the Pt nanoparticles on the composite support, thereby facilitating Co diffusion into Pt crystal during subsequent ordering annealing to form the ordered intermetallic structure. This gaseous deposition leads to a thin carbon layer on PtCo nanoparticles, inhibiting particle growth during the annealing and mitigating Co dissolution under dynamic electrochemical conditions. The PtCo catalyst achieves impressive MEA performance and long&#8208;term durability (1.45 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V after 120&#160;000 cycles) under heavy&#8208;duty conditions.

The PtCo catalyst achieves impressive MEA performance and long-term durability (1.45 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.7&#160;V after 120&#160;000 cycles) under heavy-duty conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials: Exploring New Horizons in Catalysis Through Symmetry Breaking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral inorganic nanomaterials have emerged as a novel paradigm in catalytic design and modulation of various catalysis processes. This review highlights recent advances in their synthesis, characterization, and catalytic applications. Key chiral effects and their catalytic roles are discussed, and current challenges and future perspectives are outlined to guide further research in this growing field.








Abstract
Traditional catalytic strategies are based on composition engineering, active site modification and structural tuning to optimize performance. More recently, chirality has emerged as a novel design paradigm, enabling modulation of catalytic activity, selectivity, and enantioselective outcomes. In particular, chiral inorganic nanomaterials, which integrate intrinsic catalytic functions with unique asymmetric nanostructures, have demonstrated impressive chirality&#8208;dependent performance in various catalytic processes, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, and enantioselective organic transformations. Despite these developments, the rational design of chiral nanomaterials and mechanistic understanding of their chirality&#8208;governed catalytic behaviors remain limited. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic applications of chiral inorganic nanomaterials. It covers both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down synthetic strategies and highlights advanced techniques for probing their chiral structures and properties. Representative material systems are classified based on their composition, including metals, semiconductors, and hybrid materials. Key chirality&#8208;related effects relevant to catalysis, such as chiroptical responses, structural asymmetry, and spin regulation, are discussed, along with their implications on typical photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enantioselective transformations. Finally, major challenges and prospective directions are outlined to guide further research and practical applications in this evolving field.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Directed Assembly of Stretchable Strain Sensors with Tunable Performance on Complex Curved Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a bilayer strain sensor fabrication strategy that enables large&#8208;scale patterning via laser direct writing on 3D stretchable substrates. The resulting sensors exhibit tunable performance through laser&#8208;induced microstructural engineering. By constructing a sensor array on a hemispherical surface, the authors further demonstrate the potential of this approach for curved&#8208;surface strain mapping and deformation reconstruction.








Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are capable of accurately mapping deformation across object surfaces, serving as critical components in structural health monitoring and failure mitigation across diverse systems. However, the inherent geometric complexity and non&#8208;uniformity of real&#8208;world surfaces pose significant challenges to conformal sensor integration. Moreover, conventional strain sensors face inherent trade&#8208;offs among sensitivity, detection range, and tunability, limiting their adaptability in practical applications. This study introduces a laser direct writing strategy that combines material and process innovations to enable scalable fabrication of strain sensors on preformed stretchable curved surfaces. Precise control of laser&#8208;induced microstructures allows programmable tuning of electromechanical properties, enabling selective behaviors such as high linearity, strain insensitivity, or pronounced resistance changes at small strains. The resulting devices exhibit a high gauge factor of up to 106, a strain detection range exceeding 100%, a minimum detectable strain of 0.1%, and excellent linearity (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.98) within defined operational ranges. As a proof of concept, a sensor array is implemented for strain mapping and deformation reconstruction on a hemispherical 3D stretchable substrate, demonstrating the capability of this approach for high&#8208;resolution strain monitoring on complex, non&#8208;planar geometries.

         <title>La(OH)3&#8208;Based Lithium Ionic Conductor for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxide&#8208;based Li0.15Sr0.525La0.6(OH)3 (LSLOH) conductor is first designed and synthesized. The LSLOH is air&#8208;stable and cost&#8208;effective compared to existing inorganic electrolytes, and shows Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. The pouch cell with polymer&#8208;inorganic electrolyte delivers 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 reversible capacity over 200 cycles, showing the potential for quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (QSSLMBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage but face major challenges for applications, including air instability of electrolytes, high synthesis cost, and poor interfacial compatibility. Here, La(OH)3&#8208;based Li+ conductor Li0.15Sr0.525La0.6(OH)3 (LSLOH) is reported, which is air&#8208;stable and cost&#8208;effective. LSLOH serves as an ionic conductor exhibiting Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. To improve interfacial transport, LSLOH is incorporated into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;LiTFSI polymer electrolyte (PL) to form a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PL&#8208;LSLOH). LSLOH provides additional Li&#8314; transport channels, while La3+ and Sr2+ interact with TFSI&#8722; to promote Li&#8314; mobility. Moreover, LSLOH induces the formation of a LiOH and Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. As a result, the LiNi0.6Co0.1Mn0.3O2 | PL&#8208;LSLOH | Li pouch cells achieve 2.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (with cathode loading of 19&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) over 200 cycles with 92.5% initial capacity retention, underscoring the potential for scale&#8208;up. For the first time, this work demonstrates La(OH)3&#8208;based lithium ionic conductors and electrolyte design that address key barriers to the QSSLMBs.
