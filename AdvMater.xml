         <title>A Soft, Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Naked&#8208;Eye Strain/Stress Visualization Patch</title>

Abstract
Learning about the strain/stress distribution in a material is essential to achieving its mechanical stability and proper functionality. Conventional techniques such as universal testing machines only apply to static samples with standardized geometry in laboratory environment. Soft mechanical sensors based on stretchable conductors, carbon&#8208;filled composites or conductive gels possess better adaptability, but still face challenges from complicated fabrication process, dependence on extra readout device and limited strain/stress mapping ability. Inspired by the camouflage mechanism of cuttlefish and chameleons, here we developed an innovative responsive hydrogel containing light&#8208;scattering &#8220;mechano&#8208;iridophores&#8221;. Force induced reversible phase separation manipulated the dynamic generation of mechano&#8208;iridophores, serving as optical indicators of local deformation. Patch&#8208;shaped mechanical sensors made from the responsive hydrogel featured fast response time (&lt;0.4 s), high spatial resolution (&#8764;100&#160;&#956;m) and wide dynamic ranges (e.g., 10%&#8208;150% strain). The intrinsic adhesiveness and self&#8208;healing capability of sensing patches also ensured their excellent applicability and robustness. This combination of chemical and optical properties allowed strain/stress distributions in target samples to be directly identified by naked eyes or smartphone apps, which had not yet been achieved. The great advantages above are ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation mechanical sensors towards material studies, damage diagnosis, risk prediction and smart devices.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Organic Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence Materials Based on A Functional Unit Combination Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A rational molecular design strategy facilitates the development of a purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material system with precisely regulated luminescence properties, which surely promotes its functional integration and intelligent application. Here, we propose a functional unit combination strategy to design novel RTP molecules combining a folding unit with diverse luminescent cores. The different luminescent cores are mainly responsible for tunable RTP properties, while the folding unit contributes to the spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement, which makes the RTP material design as workable as the building block principle. By this strategy, a series of color/lifetime&#8208;tunable RTP materials were achieved with unique photo&#8208;responsive RTP enhancement when subjected to UV irradiation, which expands their application scenarios in reusable privacy tags, advanced &#8220;4D&#8221; encryption, and phase separation analysis of blended polymers. This work suggests a simple and effective strategy to design purely organic RTP materials with tunable color and lifetime, and also provides new application options for photo&#8208;responsive dynamic RTP materials.

         <title>Oligo(Phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice For Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great advantages as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we design and synthesize two kgm topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based COFs for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF&#8208;954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibit high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF&#8208;954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ultraviolet&#8208;visible light irradiation. Additionally, the water&#8208;drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25&#160;mL and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 mins under ultraviolet&#8208;visible light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrate an effective design strategy towards highly efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Atomic Distance Engineering in Metal Catalysts to Regulate Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is very important to understand the structure&#8208;performance relationship of metal catalysts by adjusting the microstructure of catalysts at the atomic scale. The atomic distance has an essential influence on the composition of the environment of active metal atom, which is a key factor for the design of targeted catalysts with desired function. In this review, we discuss and summarize strategies for changing the atomic distance from three aspects and relate their effects on the reactivity of catalysts. Firstly, we introduce the effects of regulating bond length between metal and coordination atom at one single&#8208;atom site on the catalytic performance. The bond lengths are affected by the strain effect of the support and high&#8208;shell doping, and can evolve during the reaction. Next, we try to discuss the influence of the distance between single&#8208;atom sites on the catalytic performance. Due to the space matching of adsorption and electron transport, the catalytic performance can be adjusted with the shortening of site distance. In addition, the effect of the arrangement spacing of the surface metal active atoms on the catalytic performance of metal nanocatalysts is studied. Finally, we give a comprehensive summary and outlook of the relationship between atomic distance and catalytic performance.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent consecutive discoveries of various 2D materials have triggered significant scientific and technological interests owing to their exceptional material properties, originally stemming from 2D confined geometry. Ever&#8208;expanding library of 2D materials can provide ideal solutions to critical challenges facing in current technological trend of the 4th industrial revolution. Moreover, chemical modification of 2D materials to customize their physical/chemical properties can satisfy the broad spectrum of different specific requirements across diverse application areas. This review focuses on three particular emerging application areas of 2D materials: smart fibers, soft robotics and single atom catalysts, which hold immense potentials for academic and technological advancements in the post&#8208;AI era. Smart fibers showcase unconventional functionalities including healthcare/environmental monitoring, energy storage/harvesting and antipathogenic protection in the forms of wearable fibers and textiles. Soft robotics aligns with future trend to overcome longstanding limitations of hard&#8208;material based mechanics by introducing soft actuators and sensors. Single atom catalysts are widely useful in energy storage/conversion and environmental management, principally contributing to low carbon footprint for sustainable post AI era. We highlight significance and unique values of 2D materials in these emerging applications, where our research group has devoted research efforts for more than a decade.

         <title>Selective Organ&#8208;Targeting Hafnium Oxide Nanoparticles with Multienzyme&#8208;Mimetic Activities Attenuate Radiation&#8208;Induced Tissue Damage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Radioprotective agents hold clinical promises to counteract off&#8208;target adverse effects of radiation and benefit radiotherapeutic outcomes, yet the inability to control drug transport in human organs poses a leading limitation. Based upon a validated rank&#8208;based multigene signature model, we evaluate radiosensitivity indices of diverse normal organs as a genomic predictor of radiation susceptibility. We rationally design Selective ORgan&#8208;Targeting (SORT) hafnium oxide nanoparticles (HfO2 NPs) via modulated synthesis by &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin, homing to top vulnerable organs. HfO2 NPs like Hensify are commonly radioenhancers, but SORT HfO2 NPs exhibit surprising radioprotective effects dictated by unfolded ligands and Hf(0)/Hf(IV) redox couples. Still, the X&#8208;ray attenuation patterns allow radiological confirmation in target organs by dual&#8208;beam spectral computed tomography.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radioprotective agents hold clinical promises to counteract off-target adverse effects of radiation and benefit radiotherapeutic outcomes, yet the inability to control drug transport in human organs poses a leading limitation. Based upon a validated rank-based multigene signature model, we evaluate radiosensitivity indices of diverse normal organs as a genomic predictor of radiation susceptibility. We rationally design &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;elective &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt;gan-&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;argeting (SORT) hafnium oxide nanoparticles (HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs) via modulated synthesis by &#945;-lactalbumin, homing to top vulnerable organs. HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs like Hensify are commonly radioenhancers, but SORT HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs exhibit surprising radioprotective effects dictated by unfolded ligands and Hf(0)/Hf(IV) redox couples. Still, the X-ray attenuation patterns allow radiological confirmation in target organs by dual-beam spectral computed tomography. SORT HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs present potent antioxidant activities, catalytically scavenge reactive oxygen species, and mimic multienzyme catalytic activities. Consequently, SORT NPs rescue radiation-induced DNA damage in mouse and rabbit models and provide survival benefits upon lethal exposures. In addition to inhibiting radiation-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, SORT NPs impede DNA damage and inflammation by attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades. We propose a universal methodology to reverse radioenhancers into radioprotectors. SORT radioprotective agents with image guidance are envisioned as compelling in personalized shielding from radiation deposition.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Layered Inorganic Silicate Aerogel Pillared by Nanoclusters for High Temperature Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Layered inorganic material, with large&#8208;area interlayer surface and interface, provide an essential material platform for constructing new configuration of functional materials. Herein, we demonstrate a layered materials pillared with nanoclusters realizing high temperature thermal insulation performance for the first time. Specifically, systematic synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and finite element calculation analysis show that ZrOx nanoclusters served as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to effectively produce porous structures with enough boundary defect while maintaining the layered structure, thereby significantly reducing solid state thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.32&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, 298&#8211;573 K). Moreover, the layered inorganic silicate material assembled aerogel also exhibits superior thermal insulation performance from room temperature (0.034&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, 298 K, air conditions) to high temperature (0.187&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, 1073 K, air conditions) and largely enhanced compressive strength (42&#160;kPa at 80% compression), which is the best layered material based aerogel that has achieved synergistic improvement in thermal and mechanical performance so far. Layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared by nanoclusters will pave a new avenue for design of advanced thermal insulation materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Synthesis of 2d Ternary Transition Metal Phosphorous Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ternary transition metal phosphorous chalcogenides (TMPCs) have attracted extensive research interest due to their widely tunable band gap, rich electronic properties, inherent magnetic and ferroelectric properties. However, the synthesis of TMPCs via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still challenging since it is difficult to control reactions among multi&#8208;precursors. Here, we propose a subtractive element growth mechanism to controllably synthesize the TMPCs. Based on the growth mechanism, the TMPCs including FePS3, FePSe3, MnPS3, MnPSe3, CdPS3, CdPSe3, In2P3S9 and SnPS3 are achieved successfully and further confirmed by Raman, second harmonic generation (SHG) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The typical TMPCs &#8211; SnPS3 shows a strong SHG signal at 1064&#160;nm, with an effective nonlinear susceptibility &#967;(2) of 8.41&#215;10&#8722;11 m V&#8722;1, which is about 8 times of that in MoS2. And the photodetector based on CdPSe3 exhibits superior detection performances with responsivity of 582&#160;mA/W, high detectivity of 3.19&#160;&#215;&#160;1011 Jones and fast rise time of 611 &#956;s, which is better than most previously reported TMPCs based photodetectors. These results demonstrate the high quality of TMPCs and promote the exploration of the optical properties of 2D TMPCs for their applications in optoelectronics.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Induced Lattice Strain for High&#8208;Performance Organic Transistors with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Integrating the merits of low cost, flexibility, and large&#8208;area processing, organic semiconductors (OSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electronic materials. The mobility and stability are the key figure of merit for its practical application. However, it is greatly challenging to improve the mobility and stability simultaneously owing to the weak interactions and poor electronic coupling between OSCs molecules. Here, we developed an oxygen&#8208;induced lattice strain (OILS) strategy to achieve OSCs with both high&#8208;mobility and high&#8208;stability. Utilizing the strategy, the maximum mobility of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT) organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) rises to 15.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and the contact resistance lowers to 25.5 &#937;&#183;cm. Remarkably, the thermal stability of DNTT is much improved, and a record saturated power density of approximately 3.4&#215;104&#160;W cm&#8722;2 is obtained. Both the experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the lattice compressive strain induced by oxygen is responsible for the high performance and stability. Furthermore, the universality of the strategy is manifested in both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type small OSCs. This work provides a novel strategy to improve both the mobility and the stability of OSCs, paving the way for the practical applications of organic devices.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Healing Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of so&#8208;called smart organic coatings for anticorrosion application involves stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with a self&#8208;healing ability. For this, it is of crucial importance to understand various aspects related to the storage and release of self&#8208;healing agents, as well as the spreading of the trigger signal. The requirements and possibilities for designing self&#8208;healing materials for corrosion protection are discussed.








Abstract
Organic coatings are one of the most popular and powerful strategies for protecting metals against corrosion. They can be applied in different ways, such as by dipping, spraying, electrophoresis, casting, painting, or flow coating. They offer great flexibility of material designs and cost effectiveness. Moreover, self&#8208;healing has evolved as a new research topic for protective organic coatings in the last two decades. Responsive materials play a crucial role in this new research field. However, for targeting the development of high&#8208;performance self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection, it is not sufficient just to focus on smart responsive materials and suitable active agents for self&#8208;healing. A better understanding of how coatings can react on different stimuli induced by corrosion, how these stimuli can spread in the coating, and how the released agents can reach the corroding defect is also of high importance. Such knowledge would allow the&#160;design of coatings that are optimized for specific applications. Herein, the requirements and possibilities from the corrosion and synthesis perspectives for designing materials for preparing self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection are discussed.

         <title>Stabilizing Metal Halide Perovskites for Solar Fuel Production: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as one of the promising photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their exceptional photophysical properties. This review focuses on their most pressing stability issue for practical applications and summarizes the latest stabilization strategies to design and prepare water&#8208;stable perovskite photocatalysts.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are emerging photocatalyst materials that can enable sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion by virtue of their broad absorption spectra, effective separation/transport of photogenerated carriers, and solution processability. Although preliminary studies show the excellent photocatalytic activities of MHPs, their intrinsic structural instability due to the low formation energy and soft ionic nature is an open challenge for their practical applications. This review discusses the latest understanding of the stability issue and strategies to overcome this issue for MHP&#8208;based photocatalysis. First, the origin of the instability issue at atomic levels and the design rules for robust structures are analyzed and elucidated.

     alt="Stabilizing Metal Halide Perovskites for Solar Fuel Production: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Prospects"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as one of the promising photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their exceptional photophysical properties. This review focuses on their most pressing stability issue for practical applications and summarizes the latest stabilization strategies to design and prepare water-stable perovskite photocatalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are emerging photocatalyst materials that can enable sustainable solar-to-chemical energy conversion by virtue of their broad absorption spectra, effective separation/transport of photogenerated carriers, and solution processability. Although preliminary studies show the excellent photocatalytic activities of MHPs, their intrinsic structural instability due to the low formation energy and soft ionic nature is an open challenge for their practical applications. This review discusses the latest understanding of the stability issue and strategies to overcome this issue for MHP-based photocatalysis. First, the origin of the instability issue at atomic levels and the design rules for robust structures are analyzed and elucidated. This is then followed by presenting several different material design strategies for stability enhancement, including reaction medium modification, material surface protection, structural dimensionality engineering, and chemical composition engineering. Emphases are placed on understanding the effects of these strategies on photocatalytic stability as well as the possible structure-performance correlation. Finally, the possible future research directions for pursuing stable and efficient MHP photocatalysts in order to accelerate their technological maturity on a practical scale are outlined. With that, it is hoped to provide readers a valuable snapshot of this rapidly developing and exciting field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Learning in Mechanical Metamaterials: From Prediction and Generation to Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials, from property prediction and geometry generation to inverse design. It is highly anticipated that deep learning can bring about significant advancements in mechanical metamaterials by creating universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence in the near&#160;future.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are meticulously designed structures with exceptional mechanical properties determined by their microstructures and constituent materials. Tailoring their material and geometric distribution unlocks the potential to achieve unprecedented bulk properties and functions. However, current mechanical metamaterial design considerably relies on experienced designers' inspiration through trial and error, while investigating their mechanical properties and responses entails time&#8208;consuming mechanical testing or computationally expensive simulations. Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the design process of mechanical metamaterials, enabling property prediction and geometry generation without prior knowledge. Furthermore, deep generative models can transform conventional forward design into inverse design. Many recent studies on the implementation of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials are highly specialized, and their pros and cons may not be immediately evident. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in property prediction, geometry generation, and inverse design of mechanical metamaterials. Additionally, this review highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning to create universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence. This article is expected to be valuable not only to researchers working on mechanical metamaterials but also those in the field of materials&#160;informatics.

         <title>Reversible Multielectron Redox Chemistry in a NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe&#8208;substituted Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 cathode with Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type structure is proposed, which realizes reversible structural evolution and multielectron redox reactions (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) by incorporating iron, whose unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital are inextricably related to the activation of higher&#8208;voltage redox couple.








Abstract
Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON&#8208;type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe&#8208;substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high&#8208;voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10&#160;000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic&#8208;migration energy barrier and ideal Na+&#8208;diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher&#8208;valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;duration cycling lifespan (3000&#160;stable cycles at 50 C), along with material&#8208;level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Stabilized Fiber Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Amniotic Fluid During Pregnancy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Diseases in pregnancy endanger millions of fetuses worldwide every year. The onset of these diseases can be early warned by the dynamic abnormalities of biochemicals in amniotic fluid, thus requiring real&#8208;time monitoring. However, when continuously penetrated by detection devices, the amnion is prone to loss of robustness and rupture, which is difficult to regenerate. Here, we present an interface&#8208;stabilized fiber sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of biochemical dynamics in amniotic fluid during pregnancy. The sensor is seamlessly integrated into the amnion through tissue adhesion, amniotic regeneration and uniform stress distribution, posing no risk to the amniotic fluid environment. The sensor demonstrates a response performance of less than 0.3% fluctuation under complex dynamic conditions and an accuracy of more than 98% from the second to the third trimester. By applying it to early warning of diseases such as intrauterine hypoxia, intrauterine infection, and fetal growth restriction, fetal survival increases to 95% with timely intervention.

         <title>Molecular Heptazine&#8208;triazine Junction over Carbon Nitride Frameworks for Artificial Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Revealing the photocatalytic mechanism between various junctions and catalytic activities has become the hotspot in photocatalytic system. Herein, an internal molecular heptazine/triazine (H/T) junction in crystalline carbon nitride (HTCN) was constructed and devoted to selective two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. In&#8208;situ XRD spectra under various temperature authenticated the successful formation of molecular H/T junction in HTCN during the calcining process rather than physically mixing. The increased surface photovoltage (SPV) and transient photovoltage (TPV) signals, and the decreased exciton binding energy (Eb) undoubtably elucidated that an obvious increasement of carrier density and diffusion capability of photogenerated electrons were realized over HTCN. Additionally, the analyses of in&#8208;situ photoirradiated Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and femto&#8208;second transient absorption spectra (fs&#8208;TAS) revealed the successful construction of the strong internal built&#8208;in&#8208;electric field and existence of the majority of long&#8208;lived shallow trapped electrons associated with molecular H/T junction over HTCN, respectively. Benefiting from these, the photocatalytic results exhibited an incredible improvement (96.5&#8208;fold) for H2O2 production. This novel work provides a comprehensive understanding of the long&#8208;lived reactive charges in molecular H/T junction for strengthening the driving&#8208;force for photocatalytic H2O2 production, which opens potential applications for enhancing PCN&#8208;based photocatalytic redox reactions.

Abstract
The fabrication of perfusable hydrogels is crucial for recreating in vitro microphysiological environments. Existing strategies to fabricate complex microchannels in hydrogels involve sophisticated equipment/techniques. We report a cost&#8208;effective, facile, versatile, and ultra&#8208;fast methodology to fabricate perfusable microchannels of complex shapes in photopolymerizable hydrogels without the need of specialized equipment or sophisticated protocols. Our methodology utilizes one&#8208;step UV light&#8208;triggered crosslinking and a photomask printed on inexpensive transparent films to photopattern PEG&#8208;norbornene hydrogels. Complex and intricate patterns with high resolution, including perfusable microchannels, can be fabricated in &lt;1 second. We integrate the perfusable hydrogel into a custom&#8208;made microfluidic device that permits connection to external pump systems, allowing continuous fluid perfusion into the microchannels. Under dynamic culture, human endothelial cells form a functional and confluent endothelial monolayer that remains viable for at least 7 days and respond to inflammatory stimuli. Finally, we adapt our approach to photopattern norbornene hyaluronic acid hydrogels, highlighting the versatility of the technique. This study presents an innovative strategy to simplify and reduce the cost of biofabrication techniques for developing functional in vitro models using perfusable 3D hydrogels. Our approach offers a novel solution to overcome the complexities associated with existing methods, allowing engineering advanced in vitro microphysiological environments.

         <title>Measuring Solvent Exchange in Silica Nanoparticles with Rotor&#8208;based Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Measuring the diffusivity of molecules is the first step towards understanding their dependence and controlling diffusion, but the challenge increases with the decrease of molecular size, particularly for non&#8208;fluorescent and non&#8208;reactive molecules such as solvents. Here, we demonstrate the capability to monitor the solvent exchange process within the micropores of silica with millisecond time resolution, by simply embedding a rotor&#8208;based fluorophore (thioflavin T) in colloidal silica nanoparticles. Basically, the silica provides an extreme case of viscous microenvironment, which is affected by the polarity of the solvents. The fluorescence intensity traces could be well fitted to the Fickian diffusion model, allowing analytical solution of the diffusion process and revealing the diffusion coefficients. The validation experiments, involving the water&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;water solvent exchange, the comparison of different drying conditions, and the variation in the degree of cross&#8208;linking in silica, confirmed the effectiveness and sensitivity of this method for characterizing diffusion in silica micropores. This work focuses on the method development of measuring diffusivity and the high temporal resolution in tracking solvent exchange dynamics over a short distance (within 165&#160;nm) opens enormous possibilities for further studies.

         <title>Aromatic&#8208;Free Polymers Based All&#8208;Organic Dielectrics with Breakdown Self&#8208;Healing for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers are becoming increasingly desirable for capacitive energy storage in renewable energy utilization, electrified transportation, and pulse power systems. Current dielectric polymers typically require robust aromatic molecular frameworks to ensure structural thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Nevertheless, the introduction of aromatic units compromises electrical insulation owing to pronounced &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions that facilitate electron transport and eliminates the breakdown self&#8208;healing property owing to their high carbon content. Herein, we describe an aromatic&#8208;free polynorborne copolymer exhibiting an electrical conductivity&#8212;two orders of magnitude lower than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyetherimide&#8212;at elevated temperatures and high electric fields owing to its large bandgap (&#8764; 4.64&#160;eV) and short hopping conduction distance (&#8764; 0.63&#160;nm). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the copolymer can effectively suppress the excitation of high&#8208;field valence electrons. Furthermore, the incorporation of trace semiconductors results in high discharge density (3.73 J cm&#8722;3) and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency (95% at 150&#176;C), outperforming existing high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers. The excellent electrical breakdown self&#8208;healing capability of the copolymer film at elevated temperatures further demonstrates its potential for use in dielectric capacitors capable of continuous operation under extreme conditions.

         <title>Ferroics in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites: Fundamentals, Design Strategies and Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) afford highly versatile structure design and lattice dimensionalities; thus, they are actively researched as material platforms for the tailoring of ferroic behaviors. Unlike single&#8208;phase organic or inorganic materials, the interlayer coupling between organic and inorganic components in HOIPs allows the modification of strain and symmetry by chirality transfer or lattice distortion, thereby enabling the co&#8208;existence of ferroic orders. This review focuses on the principles for engineering one or multiple ferroic orders in HOIPs, and the conditions for achieving multiferroicity and magnetoelectric properties. The prospects of multi&#8208;level ferroic modulation and spin orbitronics in HOIPs are also presented.

         <title>Optical Enhancement of Indirect Bandgap 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Multi&#8208;Functional Optoelectronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifications to improve the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides and their emerging applications in optoelectronic sensors are the focus of this review. Various engineering techniques are discussed to overcome their limitations derived from the indirect bandgap of multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as well as future directions of these materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The unique electrical and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make them attractive nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications, especially optical sensors. However, the optical characteristics of these materials are dependent on the number of layers. Monolayer TMDs have a direct bandgap that provides higher photoresponsivity compared to multilayer TMDs with an indirect bandgap. Nevertheless, multilayer TMDs are more appropriate for various photodetection applications due to their high carrier density, broad spectral response from UV to near&#8208;infrared, and ease of large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, this review focuses on the modification of the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap TMDs and their emerging applications. Several successful developments in optical devices are examined, including band structure engineering, device structure optimization, and heterostructures. Furthermore, it introduces cutting&#8208;edge techniques and future directions for optoelectronic devices based on multilayer TMDs.

Abstract
The emergence of nano innovations in membrane distillation (MD) has garnered increasing scientific interest. This enabled the exploration of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nano&#8208;enabled MD membranes with desirable properties, which significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of the MD process and open up opportunities for achieving sustainable water&#8208;energy&#8208;environment (WEE) nexus. This comprehensive review provides broad coverage and in&#8208;depth analysis of recent innovations in nano&#8208;enabled MD membranes, focusing on their role in achieving desirable properties, such as strong liquid&#8208;repellence, high resistance to scaling, fouling, and wetting, as well as efficient self&#8208;heating and self&#8208;cleaning functionalities. The recent developments in nano&#8208;enhanced photothermal&#8208;catalytic applications for water&#8208;energy co&#8208;generation within a single MD system are also discussed. Furthermore, we identify the bottlenecks that impede the scale&#8208;up of nano&#8208;enhanced MD membranes and propose a future roadmap for their sustainable commercialization. This holistic overview is expected to inspire future research and development efforts to fully harness the potential of nano&#8208;enabled MD membranes to achieve sustainable integration of water, energy, and the environment.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Self&#8208;Assembled Hydroxyl Radical Generator Based on Photoinduced Cascade Electron Transfer for Hypoxic Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generators (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) that are activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, capable of forming nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The generation of &#8226;OH is accomplished with high efficiency through photoinduced cascade electron transfer pathways within the self&#8208;assembled molecular state.

The hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) is an extremely potent reactive oxygen species that plays a crucial role in photooxidations within the realm of hypoxic tumor therapy. However, the current methods for &#8226;OH photogeneration typically rely on inorganic materials that require UV/vis light excitation. Consequently, photogenerators based on organic molecules, especially those utilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation, are rare. In this study, the concept of photoinduced cascade charge transfer (PICET), which utilizes NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) to generate &#8226;OH is introduced. The ANOR&#8208;Cy5 photosensitizer, with its flexible hydrophobic structure, enables the formation of nanoparticles in aqueous solutions through molecular assembly. PICET involves a symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation&#8208;induced localized charge&#8208;separated state, transitioning to a delocalized charge&#8208;separated state, which governs the efficiency of &#8226;OH generation. Thanks to the oxygen&#8208;independent nature of &#8226;OH generation and its robust oxidative properties, the ANOR&#8208;Cy5&#8208;based photosensitizer demonstrates highly effective photoinduced anti&#8208;cancer effects, even under severely hypoxic conditions. This discovery emphasizes the potential for achieving &#8226;OH photogeneration using a single organic molecule through the engineering of molecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby opening up new possibilities for phototherapy and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a series of hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generators (ANOR-Cy5) that are activated by near-infrared (NIR) light, capable of forming nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The generation of &#8226;OH is accomplished with high efficiency through photoinduced cascade electron transfer pathways within the self-assembled molecular state. Consequently, ANOR-Cy5 exhibits exceptional efficacy in inducing photoablation of hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Beyond Rattling: Tetrahedrites as Incipient Ionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tetrahedrite, copper ions are mobile at temperatures of 200&#160;K or above, but confined to cages within the crystal structure. The localized diffusional jumps of the copper ions within a confined octahedral environment are effective at suppressing thermal conduction. This work reveals that tetrahedrite behaves as an incipient ionic conductor.








Abstract
Materials with ultralow thermal conductivity are crucial to many technological applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, thermal barrier coatings, and optoelectronics. Liquid&#8208;like mobile ions are effective at disrupting phonon propagation, hence suppressing thermal conduction. However, high ionic mobility leads to the degradation of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric materials under operating conditions due to ion migration and metal deposition at the cathode, hindering their practical application. Here, a new type of behavior, incipient ionic conduction, which leads to ultralow thermal conductivity, while overcoming the issues of degradation inherent in liquid&#8208;like materials, is identified. Using neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is demonstrated that in tetrahedrite, an established thermoelectric material with a remarkably low thermal conductivity, copper ions,&#160;although mobile above 200 K, are predominantly confined to cages within the crystal structure. Hence the undesirable migration of cations to the cathode can be avoided. These findings unveil a new approach for the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity, by exploring systems in which incipient ionic conduction may be present.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Magnetic MX3 Single&#8208;Chains (M = Cr, V and X = Cl, Br, I)</title>

Abstract
Magnetic materials in reduced dimensions are not only excellent platforms for fundamental studies of magnetism, but they play crucial roles in technological advances. The discovery of intrinsic magnetism in monolayer two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals systems has sparked enormous interest, but the single&#8208;chain limit of one&#8208;dimensional magnetic van der Waals materials has been largely unexplored. Here, we report on a family of one&#8208;dimensional magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I), prepared in fully&#8208;isolated fashion within the protective cores of carbon nanotubes. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique structures that differ from the well&#8208;known 2D honeycomb lattice MX3 structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal charge&#8208;driven reversible magnetic phase transitions.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Networks Meet Water: It's Complicated!</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robotics is a field of research that solves the challenges facing traditional robotics through the use of compliant materials such as liquid crystal networks (LCNs). However, LCNs face limitations when interacting with water. The relationship between LCNs and water is examined, the existing body of literature on LCNs as aquatic soft robots is discussed, and possible paths forward are discussed.








Abstract
Soft robots are composed of compliant materials that facilitate high degrees of freedom, shape&#8208;change adaptability, and safer interaction with humans. An attractive choice of material for soft robotics is crosslinked networks of liquid crystal polymers (LCNs), as they are responsive to a wide variety of external stimuli and capable of undergoing fast, programmable, complex shape morphing, which allows for their use in a wide range of soft robotic applications. However, unlike hydrogels, another popular material in soft robotics, LCNs have limited applicability in flooded or aquatic environments. This can be attributed not only to the poor efficiency of common LCN actuation methods underwater but also to the complicated relationship between LCNs and water. In this review, the relationship between water and LCNs is elaborated and the existing body of literature is surveyed where LCNs, both hygroscopic and non&#8208;hygroscopic, are utilized in aquatic soft robotic applications. Then the challenges LCNs face in widespread adaptation to aquatic soft robotic applications are discussed and, finally, possible paths forward for their successful use in aquatic environments are envisaged.

         <title>A Balance between Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Microgel Mechanics Governs Stem Cell Viability in Injectable Dynamic Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guest&#8208;host injectable microgel formulation strategy is introduced in which flowability and elasticity are tuned independently by modulating inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;microgel crosslinking. Flowability and elasticity represent conflicting constraints for injectable design, &#160;as they respectively govern injection protection and engraftment potential following injection. The balance between these parameters is systematically investigated and found to regulate stem cell viability during injection.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are increasingly explored for the delivery of cells to tissue. These materials exhibit both liquid&#8208;like properties, protecting cells from mechanical stress during injection, and solid&#8208;like properties, providing a stable 3D engraftment niche. Many strategies for modulating injectable hydrogels tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like material properties simultaneously, such that formulation changes designed to improve injectability can reduce stability at the delivery site. The ability to independently tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like properties would greatly facilitate formulation development. Here, such a strategy is presented in which cells are ensconced in the pores between microscopic granular hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels (microgels), where elasticity is tuned with static covalent intra&#8208;microgel crosslinks and flowability with mechanosensitive adamantane&#8208;cyclodextrin (AC) inter&#8208;microgel crosslinks. Using the same AC&#8208;free microgels as a 3D printing support bath, the location of each cell is preserved as it exits the needle, allowing identification of&#160;the mechanism driving mechanical trauma&#8208;induced cell death. The microgel AC concentration is varied to find the threshold from microgel yielding&#8208; to AC interaction&#8208;dominated injectability, and this threshold is exploited to fabricate a microgel with better injection&#8208;protecting performance. This delivery strategy, and the balance between intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;microgel properties it reveals, may facilitate the development of new cell injection formulations.

Abstract
Current research in the area of surgical mesh implants is somewhat limited to traditional designs and synthesis of various mesh materials, whereas meshes with multiple functions may be an effective approach to address long&#8208;standing challenges including postoperative complications. We herein present a bioresorbable electronic surgical mesh that offers high mechanical strength over extended timeframes, wireless post&#8208;operative pressure monitoring, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for the restoration of tissue structure and function. Study of materials and mesh layouts provides a wide range of tunability of mechanical, biochemical properties. Dissolvable dielectric composite with porous structure in a pyramidal shape enhances sensitivity of a wireless capacitive pressure sensor, and resistive microheaters integrated with inductive coils provide thermo&#8208;responsive drug delivery system for an antibacterial agent. In vivo evaluations demonstrate reliable, long&#8208;lived operation and effective treatment for abdominal hernia defects, by clear evidence of suppressed complications such as adhesion formation and infections.

         <title>Reconfigurable Cascaded Thermal Neuristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
While the complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is the mainstream for the hardware implementation of neural networks, we explore an alternative route based on a new class of spiking oscillators we call &#8220;thermal neuristors&#8221;, which operate and interact solely via thermal processes. Utilizing the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition in vanadium dioxide, we demonstrate a wide variety of reconfigurable electrical dynamics mirroring biological neurons. Notably, inhibitory functionality is achieved just in a single oxide device, and cascaded information flow is realized exclusively through thermal interactions. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the neuristors, a detailed theoretical model is developed, which accurately reflects the experimental results. This study establishes the foundation for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient thermal neural networks, fostering progress in brain&#8208;inspired computing.

         <title>Suppressing Bulk Strain and Surface O2 Release in Li&#8208;rich Cathodes by Just Tuning the Li Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered oxides represent a prominent class of cathode materials extensively employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The structural degradation of layered cathodes causes the capacity decay during battery cycling, which is generally induced by anisotropic lattice strain in the bulk of the cathode particle and undesirable oxygen release at the surface. However, particularly in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here we construct a thin (1&#8208;nm) and coherent spinel&#8208;like phase on the surface of LLOs particle (LixMn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) to suppress bulk strain and surface O2 release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel&#8208;like phase hinders the surface O2 release by accommodating O2 inside the surface layer, while the trapped O2 in the bulk lattice impedes strain evolution by about 70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs cathodes. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability in bulk and surface leads to a significantly improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of about 99.5% after 100 cycles at a rate of 0.1 C. Our findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high&#8208;capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.

         <title>In Situ Formation of 2d Perovskite Seeding for Record&#8208;Efficiency Indoor Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
With 40% efficiency under room light intensity, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) would be promising power supplies for low&#8208;light applications, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and indoor electronics, should they become commercialized. Herein, &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is utilized to spontaneously form a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds for improved film uniformity, crystallization quality, and solar cell performance. It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10&#8208;fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small&#8208;area (0.09 cm2) perovskite solar cell achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large&#8208;area cells (1.00 cm2, and 2.56 cm2) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale&#8208;up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs (i&#8208;PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large&#8208;area printing technology.

         <title>Injection&#8208;on&#8208;skin Granular Adhesive for Interactive Human&#8208;machine Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Realization of interactive human&#8208;machine interfaces (iHMI) has been improved with development of soft tissue&#8208;like strain sensors beyond hard robotic exosuits, potentially allowing cognitive behavior therapy and physical rehabilitation for patients with brain disorders. Here, we report on a strain&#8208;sensitive granular adhesive inspired by the core&#8208;shell architectures of natural basil seeds for iHMI as well as human&#8208;metaverse interfacing. The granular adhesive sensor consists of easily fragmented hydro&#8208;micropellets as a core and tissue&#8208;adhesive catecholamine layers as a shell, satisfying great on&#8208;skin injectability, ionic&#8208;electrical conductivity, and sensitive resistance changes through reversible yet robust cohesion among the hydropellets. Particularly, it is found that the ionic&#8208;electrical self&#8208;doping of the catecholamine shell on hydrosurfaces leads to a compact ion density of the materials. Based on these physical and electrical properties of the sensor, it is demonstrated that successful iHMI integration with a robot arm in both real and virtual environments enable robotic control by finger gesture and haptic feedback. This study expresses benefits of using granular hydrogel&#8208;based strain sensors for implementing on&#8208;skin writable bioelectronics and their bridging into the metaverse world.

         <title>Polarization&#8208; and Gate&#8208;Tunable Optoelectronic Reverse in 2D Semimetal/Semiconductor Photovoltaic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polarimetric photodetector can acquire higher resolution and more surface information of imaging targets in complex environments due to the identification of light polarization. To date, the existing technologies yet sustain the poor polarization sensitivity (&lt;10), far from market application requirement. Here, the photovoltaic detectors with polarization&#8208; and gate&#8208;tunable optoelectronic reverse phenomenon are developed based on semimetal 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 and ambipolar WSe2. The device exhibits gate&#8208;tunable reverse in rectifying and photovoltaic characters due to the directional inversion of energy band, yielding a wide range of current rectification ratio from 10&#8722;2 to 103 and a clear object imaging with 100 &#215; 100 pixels. Acting as a polarimetric photodetector, the polarization ratio (PR) value can reach a steady state value of &#8764;30, which is compelling among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D&#8208;based polarized detectors. The sign reversal of polarization&#8208;sensitive photocurrent by varying the light polarization angles is also observed, that can enable the PR value with a potential to cover possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8208;&#8734;&#8594;&#8208;1). This work develops a photovoltaic detector with polarization&#8208; and gate&#8208;tunable optoelectronic reverse phenomenon, making a significant progress in polarimetric imaging and multi&#8208;function integration applications.

         <title>A Multiscale, Dynamic Elucidation of Li Solubility in The Alloy And Metallic Plating Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;containing alloys and metallic deposits offer substantial Li+ storage capacities as alternative anodes to commercial graphite. However, the thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetically competitive mechanism between Li solubility in the solid solution and intermediate alloy&#8208;induced Li deposition remains debated, particularly across the multiple scales. The elucidation of the mechanism is rather challenging due to the dynamic alloy evolution upon the non&#8208;equilibrium, transient lithiation processes under coupled physical fields. Here, we comprehensively investigate influential factors governing Li solubility in the Li&#8208;Zn alloy as a demonstrative model, spanning from the bulk electrolyte solution to the ion diffusion within the electrode. Through real&#8208;time phase tracking and spatial distribution analysis of intermediate alloy/Li metallic species at varied temperatures, current densities and particle sizes, the driving force of Li solubility and metallic plating along the Li migration pathway are probed in&#8208;depth. This study investigates the correlation between kinetics (pronounced concentration polarization, miscibility gap in lattice grains) and rate&#8208;limiting interfacial charge transfer thermodynamics in dedicating the Li diffusion into the solid solution. Additionally, the lithiophilic alloy sites with the balanced diffusion barrier and Li adsorption energy are explored to favor the homogeneous metal plating, which provides new insights for the rational innovation of high&#8208;capacity alloy/metallic anodes.

The elucidation of the mechanism is rather challenging due to the dynamic alloy evolution upon the non-equilibrium, transient lithiation processes under coupled physical fields. Here, we comprehensively investigate influential factors governing Li solubility in the Li-Zn alloy as a demonstrative model, spanning from the bulk electrolyte solution to the ion diffusion within the electrode. Through real-time phase tracking and spatial distribution analysis of intermediate alloy/Li metallic species at varied temperatures, current densities and particle sizes, the driving force of Li solubility and metallic plating along the Li migration pathway are probed in-depth. This study investigates the correlation between kinetics (pronounced concentration polarization, miscibility gap in lattice grains) and rate-limiting interfacial charge transfer thermodynamics in dedicating the Li diffusion into the solid solution. Additionally, the lithiophilic alloy sites with the balanced diffusion barrier and Li adsorption energy are explored to favor the homogeneous metal plating, which provides new insights for the rational innovation of high-capacity alloy/metallic anodes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Preparation of High Conductive Medium and Establishment of Laege Capacity Conductive Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The preparation of highly conductive media and the construction of conducting channels play a crucial role in improving the electrical conductivity of Electrically Conductive Adhesives (ECAs). Therefore, a new MXene structure is reported in this paper, and the improved structure is rationally designed by computational modeling, which greatly prevents the buildup of MXene nanosheets, improves the stability of the structure, and creates a wide electron transfer channel, and the capacitance contribution of this structure is up to 86.3%. By mixing MXene modified with Ag&#8208;plated copper powder in a quantitative relationship to form high conductive media, the electrical conductivity is largely improved and the defect of low electron transfer rate of conventional conductive fillers is broken. The potential value of high conductive media is largely exploited using high throughput and machine learning methods, and here we show that the resistivity has reached 9.668&#215;10&#8722;7 &#937;&#183;m. The first principles investigate the conductive channels and electron transfer pathways of high conductive media at the atomic level, further revealing the mechanism of action of high conductive media. This study is also the first report on the application of MXene to high conductive media.

Abstract
The limited selection of wide bandgap polymer donors for all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) is a bottleneck problem restricting their further development and remains poorly studied. Herein, a new wide bandgap polymer, namely PBBTz&#8208;Cl, was designed and synthesized by bridging the benzobisthiazole acceptor block and chlorinated benzodithiophene donor block with thiophene units for application as an electron donor in all&#8208;PSCs. PBBTz&#8208;Cl not only possessed a wide bandgap and deep energy levels, but also displayed strong absorption, high&#8208;planar structure, and good crystallinity, making it to be a promising candidate for application as polymer donor in organic solar cells. When paired with the narrow bandgap polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, a fibril&#8208;like morphology formed, which facilitated the exciton dissociation and charge transport, contributing to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.15% of the corresponding all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, when introducing another crystalline polymer acceptor BTP&#8208;2T2F into the PBBTz&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT host blend, the absorption ditch in the range of 600&#8211;750&#160;nm was filled, and the blend morphology was further optimized with the trap density reducing. As a result, the ternary blend all&#8208;PSCs achieved a significantly improved PCE of 18.60%, which is among the highest vales for all&#8208;PSCs to date.

         <title>A Simple and Versatile Approach for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Transition Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles from Metal Chloride Complexes and P(SiMe3)3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal chloride complexes react with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine under mild condition to produce metal phosphide nanoparticles, and chlorotrimethylsilane as a byproduct. The formation of Si&#8208;Cl bonds that are stronger than the starting M&#8208;Cl bonds acts as a driving force for the reaction. The potential of this strategy is illustrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide nanoparticles using [RuCl2(cymene)] and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine at 35&#176;C. Characterization with a combination of techniques including electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, evidences the formation of small (diameter of 1.3&#160;nm) and amorphous NPs with an overall Ru50P50 composition. Interestingly, these NPs can be easily immobilized on functional support materials, which is of great interest for potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. Mo50P50 and Co50P50 NPs could also be synthesized following the same strategy. This approach is simple and versatile and paves the way toward the preparation of a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Dispersion Engineering by Hybridizing the Back&#8208;Folded Soft Mode of Monomode Elastic Metamaterials with Stiff Acoustic Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In many cases, the hybridization of two or more excitation modes in solids has led to new and useful dispersion relations of waves. Well&#8208;studied examples are phonon polaritons, plasmon polaritons, particle&#8208;plasmon polaritons, cavity polaritons, and magnetic resonances at optical frequencies. In all of these cases, the lowest propagating mode couples to a finite&#8208;frequency localized resonance. Herein, the unusual metamaterial phonon dispersion relations arising from the hybridization of an ordinary acoustical phonon mode with a back&#8208;folded soft or easy phonon mode of a monomode elastic metamaterial are discussed. Conceptually, the single easy mode can have strictly zero wave velocity. In reality, its wave velocity is very much smaller than that of all other modes. Considering polymeric 3D printed elastic monomode metamaterials at ultrasound frequencies, it is shown theoretically and experimentally that the resulting pronounced avoided crossing, with a frequency splitting comparable to the mid&#8208;frequency, leads to backward&#8208;wave behavior for the lowest band over a broad frequency range, conceptually at zero loss.

         <title>Sensitive and Selective Dual&#8208;Mode Responses to Reactive Oxygen Species by Chiral Manganese Dioxide Nanoparticles for Anti&#8208;Aging Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to oxidative stress and oxidative damage, which is one of the important factors for aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring and the moderate elimination of ROS is extremely important. In this study, a ROS&#8208;responsive circular dichroic (CD) at 553&#160;nm and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual&#8208;signals chiral manganese oxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) were designed and synthesized. Both the CD and MRI signals showed excellent linear ranges for intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.0027&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.016&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The lower LOD achieved with CD detection may be attributable to its higher anti&#8208;interference capability from the intracellular matrix. Importantly, ROS&#8208;induced cell aging was intervened by chiral MnO2 NPs via redox reactions with excessive intracellular ROS. In vivo experiments confirmed that chiral MnO2 NPs effectively eliminated ROS in skin tissue, reduce oxidative stress levels, and alleviate skin aging. This approach provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of age&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Stochastic Electrical Detection of Single Ion&#8208;Gated Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconducting polymer chains constitute the building blocks for a wide range of electronic materials and devices. However, most of their electrical characteristics at single&#8208;molecule level have received little attention. Elucidating these properties could help understanding performance limits and enable new applications. Here we exploit coupled ionic&#8208;electronic charge transport to measure the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional electrical current through long single conjugated polymer chains as they form transient contacts with electrodes separated by &#8764;10&#160;nm. Fluctuations between internal conformations of the individual polymers are resolved as abrupt, multi&#8208;level switches in the electrical current. This behavior is consistent with our theoretical simulations based on the worm&#8208;like&#8208;chain model for semi&#8208;flexible polymers. In addition to probing the intrinsic properties of single semiconducting polymer chains, our results provide an unprecedented window into the dynamics of random&#8208;coil polymers and enable the use of semiconducting polymers as electrical labels for single&#8208;molecule (bio)sensing assays.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconducting polymer chains constitute the building blocks for a wide range of electronic materials and devices. However, most of their electrical characteristics at single-molecule level have received little attention. Elucidating these properties could help understanding performance limits and enable new applications. Here we exploit coupled ionic-electronic charge transport to measure the quasi-one-dimensional electrical current through long single conjugated polymer chains as they form transient contacts with electrodes separated by &#8764;10&#160;nm. Fluctuations between internal conformations of the individual polymers are resolved as abrupt, multi-level switches in the electrical current. This behavior is consistent with our theoretical simulations based on the worm-like-chain model for semi-flexible polymers. In addition to probing the intrinsic properties of single semiconducting polymer chains, our results provide an unprecedented window into the dynamics of random-coil polymers and enable the use of semiconducting polymers as electrical labels for single-molecule (bio)sensing assays.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Interfacial Excited&#8208;State Carrier Dynamics And Efficient Charge Separation in Borophene&#8208;based Heterostructures</title>

Abstract
Borophene&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures have demonstrated enormous potential in the realm of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, which has sparked a wide range of interest. However, a thorough understanding of the microscopic excited&#8208;state electronic dynamics at interfaces is lacking, which is essential for determining the macroscopic optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance of borophene&#8208;based devices. In this study, photoexcited carrier dynamics of &#946;12, &#967;3, and &#945;' borophene/MoS2 heterostructures have been systematically studied based on time&#8208;domain nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Different Schottky contacts are found in borophene/semiconductor heterostructures. The interplay between Schottky barriers, electronic coupling, and the involvement of different phonon modes collectively contribute to the unique carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures. The diverse borophene allotropes within the heterostructures exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors on an ultrafast timescale: electrons tunnel into &#945;&#900; borophene with an ultrafast transfer rate (&#8764; 29 fs) in &#945;&#900;/MoS2 heterostructures, whereas &#946;12 borophene only allows holes to migrate with a lifetime of 176 fs. The feature enables efficient charge separation and offers promising avenues for applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. This study provides insight into the interfacial carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures, which is helpful in further design of advanced 2D boron&#8208;based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Quantitative Description of Metal Center Organization and Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts (UHD&#8208;SACs) present unique opportunities for harnessing cooperative effects between neighboring metal centers. However, the lack of tools to establish correlations between the density, type, and arrangement of the isolated metal atoms with the support surface properties hinders efforts to engineer advanced material architectures. Here, we precisely describe the metal center organization in various mono&#8208; and multimetallic UHD&#8209;SACs based on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supports by coupling transmission electron microscopy with tailored machine&#8208;learning methods (released as a user&#8208;friendly web app) and density functional theory simulations. Our approach quantifies the non&#8208;negligible presence of multimers with increasing atom density, characterizes the size and shape of these low&#8209;nuclearity clusters, and identifies surface atom density criteria to ensure isolation. Further, it provides previously inaccessible experimental insights into coordination site arrangements in the NC host, uncovering a repulsive interaction that influences the disordered distribution of metal centers in UHD&#8208;SACs. This observation holds in multimetallic systems, where chemically&#8208;specific analysis quantifies the degree of intermixing. These fundamental insights into the materials chemistry of single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for designing catalytic systems with superior reactivity.

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adaptive Polymers Trigger Fission of Tumor Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor cell&#8208;derived microparticles (MPs) can function as anticancer drug delivery carriers. However, short blood circulation time, large size&#8208;induced insufficient tumor accumulation and penetration into tumor parenchyma as well as limited cellular internalization by tumor cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), and difficult intracellular drug release restrict the anticancer activity of tumor cell&#8208;derived MP&#8208;based drug delivery systems. Here, hydrophobicity&#8208;adaptive polymers based on poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrilamide) are anchored to tumor cell&#8208;derived MPs for enhanced delivery of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The polymers are hydrophilic in blood to prolong the circulation time of DOX&#8208;loaded MPs (DOX@MPs), while rapidly switch to hydrophobic at the tumor acidic microenvironment. The hydrophobicity of polymers drives the fission of tumor cell&#8208;derived MPs to form small vesicles, facilitating tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration and efficient internalization of DOX@MPs into tumor cells and CSCs. Subsequently, the hydrophobicity of polymers in acidic lysosomes further promotes DOX release to nuclei for strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells and CSCs. Our work provides a facile and simple strategy for improved anticancer drug delivery of tumor cell&#8208;derived MPs.

         <title>Transparent Recombination Electrode with Dual&#8208;Functional Transport and Protective Layer for Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rational selection and design of recombination electrodes (RCEs) are crucial to enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) with high conductivity and excellent transmittance is introduced as RCE in perovskite/organic TSCs. To prevent high&#8208;energy ITO particles destroy the underlying material during sputtering, dual&#8208;functional transport and protective layer (C1) is employed. The styryl group in C1 can be thermally crosslinked to serve as a sputtering protective layer. Meanwhile, the conjugated phenanthroline skeleton in C1 shows high electron mobility and hole blocking capability to promote the electron transport process at the interfaces and effectively reduce charge accumulation. Monolithic perovskite/organic TSC with high PCE of 24.07% and excellent stability is demonstrated by stacking a 1.77&#160;eV bandgap perovskite layer and a 1.35&#160;eV bandgap organic active layer. This strategy provides new insights for overcoming the fundamental efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices and promotes the further development of TSC devices.

         <title>Exciton Chirality Transfer Empowers Self&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Polarized Amplified Spontaneous Emission from 1D&#8208;Anchoring&#8208;3D Perovskites</title>

Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized lasers, arising from stimulated emission of imbalanced spin populations, play a vital role in spin&#8208;optoelectronics. The achievement of spin&#8208;polarized lasing remains a long&#8208;lasting challenge, which is usually tackled by external spin injection, inevitably suffering from additional losses across the barriers from injection sources to gain materials. Herein, we report self&#8208;triggered spin&#8208;polarized coherent light emission from designed composite chiral perovskites, where the imbalanced populations in achiral 3D perovskites are endowed with the spin selection of exciton chirality (EC) underpinned by chiral 1D perovskites. Efficient transfer of EC is enabled by rapid energy transfer from the chiral 1D perovskites to the achiral 3D perovskites, thereby creating an imbalance of the spin population of excited states in the achiral 3D perovskites. Stimulated emission of such populations brings self&#8208;triggered spin&#8208;polarized amplified spontaneous emission in the composite perovskites, yielding a higher degree of polarization (DOP) than that based on optical spin injection into bare achiral 3D perovskite. Chemical diversity of the composite perovskites not only enables to adjust the band gap of perovskites for broadband output of spin&#8208;polarized amplified spontaneous emission signals but also promises to manipulate radiative decay and spin relaxation toward remarkably increased values of DOP. These results highlight the importance of EC transfer mechanism for spin&#8208;polarized lasing and represent a crucial step towards the development of chiral&#8208;spintronics.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Liposomes Loaded with Monoclonal Antibodies Reduce Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation and Improve Behavioral Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease</title>

Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold promise for treating Parkinson's disease (PD), but their therapeutic use is hindered by poor delivery to the brain. In this study, we demonstrate that brain&#8208;targeted liposomes (BTL) enhance the delivery of mAbs across the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and into neurons, thereby improving the intracellular and extracellular treatment of the PD brain. BTL were decorated with transferrin to improve brain targeting through overexpressed transferrin&#8208;receptors on the BBB during PD. The BTL were loaded with SynO4, a mAb that inhibits alpha&#8208;synuclein (AS) aggregation, a pathological hallmark of PD. We show that 100&#8208;nm BTL cross human BBB models intact and were taken up by primary neurons. Inside the neurons, SynO4 is released from the nanoparticles and binds to its target, thereby reducing AS aggregation and increasing neuronal viability. In&#8208;vivo, intravenous administration of BTL led to a 7&#8208;fold increase of mAbs in brain cells, reducing AS aggregation and neuroinflammation. In addition, BTL treatments improved behavioral motor function and learning ability in mice, with a favorable safety profile. Targeted nanotechnologies are promising platforms for delivering medicines to treat brain neurodegeneration.

         <title>Breath Biopsy Reveals Systemic Immunothrombosis and Its Resolution through Bioorthogonal Dendritic Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of immunothrombosis is an unmet medical need as it relates to prevalent and life&#8208;threatening conditions, including severe COVID&#8208;19&#160;and sepsis. A novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive nanoprobe releases a volatile reporter molecule, when in contact with thrombin. The volatile reporter exits the circulation in the lungs. Analysis of the exhaled breath provides unprecedented quantitative knowledge of thrombin activity in vivo.








Abstract
Immunothrombosis, an inflammation&#8208;dependent activation of the coagulation cascade, leads to microthrombi formations in small vessels. It is a dreaded complication of COVID&#8208;19&#160;and a major cause of respiratory failure. Due to their size and disseminated nature, microthrombi are currently undetectable. Here, noninvasive detection of a volatile reporter in the exhaled air is introduced for assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. A dendritic nanoprobe, containing high loading of a thrombin&#8208;sensitive substrate, is selectively cleaved by thrombin, resulting in release of a synthetic bioorthogonal volatile organic compound (VOC). The VOC is quantitated in the exhaled air biopsies via gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS), allowing near real&#8208;time assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. The VOC detection can be further improved with more rapid and sensitive MS&#8208;based technologies. The amount of the VOC in the exhaled air decreases with resolution of the microvascular inflammation and intravascular fibrin depositions. Through conjugation of the thrombin&#8208;sensitive peptide with a rhodol derivative, a novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive fluorescent nanoprobe is developed for intravital visualization of thrombin activity in actively growing thrombi. These results establish unprecedented detection of thrombin activity in vivo, addressing this unmet medical need. This novel approach facilitates diagnosis of immunothrombosis in diseases such as diabetic complications, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Imaging Field&#8208;Driven Melting of a Molecular Solid at the Atomic Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;liquid phase transitions are imaged for molecules assembled at the surface of a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor. Electrostatic gating is seen to cause reversible transitions between a charge&#8208;neutral quasi&#8208;1D molecular solid and a negatively charged 2D liquid phase. Transiently heating the device enables nonequilibrium dynamics to be visualized. The observed behavior is explained using thermodynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;liquid phase transitions are basic physical processes, but atomically resolved microscopy has yet to capture their full dynamics. A new technique is developed for controlling the melting and freezing of self&#8208;assembled molecular structures on a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) that allows phase&#8208;transition behavior to be imaged using atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy. This is achieved by applying electric fields to 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane&#8208;decorated FETs to induce reversible transitions between molecular solid and liquid phases at the FET surface. Nonequilibrium melting dynamics are visualized by rapidly heating the graphene substrate with an electrical current and imaging the resulting evolution toward new 2D&#160;equilibrium states. An analytical model is developed that explains observed mixed&#8208;state phases based on spectroscopic measurement of solid and liquid molecular energy levels. The observed nonequilibrium melting dynamics are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Induced Fiber Optic Plasmonic Gas Sensing via Small Grazing Angle of Incidence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to fabricate a new class of plasmon&#8208;based nanoparticle&#8208;polymer composite films that realizes a distinct sorption&#8208;induced high&#8208;sensitive plasmonic gas sensing on the fiber optic sensor platform is reported. The nanoparticle&#8208;polymer composite film provides tunable optical features, specifically those associated with the epsilon near zero and localized surface plasmon resonance regions of the plasmonic nanoparticles' optical response.








Abstract
Sensing technologies based on plasmonic nanomaterials are of interest for various chemical, biological, environmental, and medical applications. In this work, an incorporation strategy of colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles (pNPs) in microporous polymer for realizing distinct sorption&#8208;induced plasmonic sensing is reported. This approach is demonstrated by introducing tin&#8208;doped indium oxide pNPs into a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1). The composite film (pNPs&#8208;polymer) provides distinct and tunable optical features on the fiber optic (FO) platform that can be used as a signal transducer for gas sensing (e.g., CO2) under atmospheric conditions. The resulting pNPs&#8208;polymer composite demonstrates high sensitivity response on FO in the evanescent field configuration, provided by the dramatic response of modes above the total&#8208;internal&#8208;reflection angle. Furthermore, by varying the pNPs content in the polymer matrix, the optical behavior of the pNPs&#8208;polymer composite film can be tuned to affect the operational wavelength by over several hundred nanometers and the sensitivity of the sensor in the near&#8208;infrared range. It is also shown that the pNPs&#8208;polymer composite film exhibits remarkable stability over a period of more than 10 months by mitigating the physical aging issue of the polymer.

         <title>Symmetry Control of Unconventional Spin&#8211;Orbit Torques in IrO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional spin&#8211;orbits have the potential for field&#8208;free switching of perpendicular magnetic materials which is desired for next generation spintronic devices. Low symmetry requirements, however, have limited the number of materials hosting unconventional spin transport. Here, epitaxial design is used to study which symmetry elements restrict unconventional spin transport providing a new route for discovering next generation spintronic materials.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torques generated by a spin current are key to magnetic switching in spintronic applications. The polarization of the spin current dictates the direction of switching required for energy&#8208;efficient devices. Conventionally, the polarizations of these spin currents are restricted to be along a certain direction due to the symmetry of the material allowing only for efficient in&#8208;plane magnetic switching. Unconventional spin&#8211;orbit torques arising from novel spin current polarizations, however, have the potential to switch other magnetization orientations such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which is desired for higher density spintronic&#8208;based memory devices. Here, it is demonstrated that low crystalline symmetry is not required for unconventional spin&#8211;orbit torques and can be generated in a nonmagnetic high symmetry material, iridium dioxide (IrO2), using epitaxial design. It is shown that by reducing the relative crystalline symmetry with respect to the growth direction large unconventional spin currents can be generated and hence spin&#8211;orbit torques. Furthermore, the spin polarizations detected in (001), (110), and (111) oriented IrO2 thin films are compared to show which crystal symmetries restrict unconventional spin transport. Understanding and tuning unconventional spin transport generation in high symmetry materials can provide a new route towards energy&#8208;efficient magnetic switching in spintronic devices.

Furthermore, the spin polarizations detected in (001), (110), and (111) oriented IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films are compared to show which crystal symmetries restrict unconventional spin transport. Understanding and tuning unconventional spin transport generation in high symmetry materials can provide a new route towards energy-efficient magnetic switching in spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocyclic Engineering of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of delayed fluorescent macrocycles is successfully synthesized via a modular strategy. Among them, MC&#8208;XT and MC&#8208;X show perfect photoluminescence quantum yields (&#8776;100%) due to more ideal macrocyclic structure and larger oscillator strength. Therefore, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on MC&#8208;XT and MC&#8208;X achieve record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 31.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Several thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials&#160;have been studied and developed to realize high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, TADF macrocycles have not been sufficiently investigated owing to the synthetic challenges, resulting in limited exploration of their luminescent properties and the corresponding highly efficient OLEDs. In this study, a series of TADF macrocycles is synthesized using a modularly tunable strategy by introducing xanthones as acceptors and phenylamine derivatives as donors. A detailed analysis of their photophysical properties combined with fragment molecules reveals characteristics of high&#8208;performance macrocycles. The results indicate that: a) the ideal structure decreases the energy loss, which in turn reduces the non&#8208;radiative transitions; b) reasonable building blocks increase the oscillator strength providing a higher radiation transition rate; c) the horizontal dipole orientation (&#920;) of the extended macrocyclic emitters is increased. Owing to the high photoluminescence quantum yields of &#8776;100% and 92% and excellent &#920; of 80 and 79% for macrocycles MC&#8208;X and MC&#8208;XT in 5&#160;wt% doped films, the corresponding devices exhibit record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of 31.6% and 26.9%, respectively, in the field of TADF macrocycles.

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Like Behavior in Ferroelectric Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer lattice and polarization coupling are explored for bilayers of in&#8208;plane&#8208;polarized ferroelectric Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3. The cross&#8208;interface coupling can induce effects analogous to exchange bias in magnetism in the form of shifted hysteresis loops. In turn, such effects can be controlled via film thickness and chemistry to produce exotic effects including multistate polarization, exchange&#8208;spring&#8208;like function, and both coercivity softening and hardening.








Abstract
Interlayer coupling in materials, such as exchange interactions at the interface between an antiferromagnet and a ferromagnet, can produce exotic phenomena not present in the parent materials. While such interfacial coupling in magnetic systems is widely studied, there is considerably less work on analogous electric counterparts (i.e., akin to electric &#8220;exchange&#8208;bias&#8208;like&#8221; or &#8220;exchange&#8208;spring&#8208;like&#8221; interactions between two polar materials) despite the likelihood that such effects can also engender new features associated with anisotropic electric dipole alignment. Here, electric analogs of such exchange interactions are reported, and their physical origins are explained for bilayers of in&#8208;plane polarized Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3 ferroelectrics. Variation of the strontium content and thickness of the layers provides for deterministic control over the switching properties of the bilayer system resulting in phenomena analogous to an exchange&#8208;spring interaction and, leveraging added control of these interactions with an electric field, the ability to realize multistate&#8208;memory function. Such observations not only hold technological promise for ferroelectrics and multiferroics but also extend the similarities between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials to include the manifestation of exchange&#8208;interaction&#8208;like phenomena.

         <title>4D Additive&#8211;Subtractive Manufacturing of Shape Memory Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, precise, and scalable four&#8208;dimensional (4D)&#160;additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing paradigm for ceramics with multimode shape memory capabilities is developed. The balance between thermal expansion and shrinkage is the mechanism for ceramic 4D printing. A high flame ablation performance of complex&#8208;shaped ceramics is achieved with Al2O3&#8208;deposited SiOC&#8208;based nanocrystalline&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase ceramic lattice structures.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;temperature structural materials, such as ceramics, is limited by their extremely high melting points and the difficulty in building complicated architectures. Four&#8208;dimensional (4D) printing helps enhance the geometrical flexibility of ceramics. However, ceramic 4D printing systems are limited by the separate processes for shape and material transformations, low accuracy of morphing systems, low resolution of ceramic structures, and their time&#8208;intensive nature. Here, a paradigm for a one&#8208;step shape/material transformation, high&#8208;2D/3D/4D&#8208;precision, high&#8208;efficiency, and scalable 4D additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing of shape memory ceramics is developed. Original/reverse and global/local multimode shape memory capabilities are achieved using macroscale SiOC&#8208;based ceramic materials. The uniformly deposited Al2O3&#8208;rich layer on the printed SiOC&#8208;based ceramic lattice structures results in an unusually high flame ablation performance of the complex&#8208;shaped ceramics. The proposed framework is expected to broaden the applications of high&#8208;temperature structural materials in the aerospace, electronics, biomedical, and art fields.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bonded Atomic Layers of Transition Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accordion&#8208;like metal&#8208;bonded transition metal carbides (MXenes) are produced through a topological reaction between Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes and selected metals, which is driven by the crystal symmetry of the MAX phases. After the delamination and assembling, the films composed of Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx MXene atomic layers exhibit high oxidation resistance and low sheet resistances, affording a significantly enhanced property in electromagnetic interference (EMI) sheilding.








Abstract
Although 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have fantastic physical and chemical properties as well as wide applications, it remains challenging to produce stable MXenes due to their rapid structural degradation. Here, unique metal&#8208;bonded atomic layers of transition metal carbides with high stabilities are produced via a simple topological reaction between chlorine&#8208;terminated MXenes and selected metals, where the metals enable them to not only remove partially Cl terminations, but also bond with adjacent atomic MXene slabs, driven by the symmetry of MAX phases. The films constructed from Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx atomic layers show high oxidation resistance up to 400&#160;&#176;C and low sheet resistance of 9.3&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1. Coupled to the multilayer structure, the Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx film displays a significantly improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding capability with a total shielding effectiveness value of 39&#160;dB at a low thickness of 3.1&#160;&#181;m, outperforming pure Ti3C2Clx film.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with an External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>

Ultrahigh&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs are demonstrated with simultaneously reduced electron leakage and high outcoupling efficiency by regulating charge carrier transport and the near&#8208;field light field. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art green PeLED achieves a world record external quantum efficiency of 30.84% at a luminance of 6514&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. The PeLED also maintains an EQE value over 20% under high brightness conditions from &#8776;100 &#8201;to 32&#160;000&#8201;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are strong candidates for next&#8208;generation display and lighting technologies due to their high color purity and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. However, PeLEDs are not superior to commercial organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) in efficiency, as some key parameters affecting their efficiency, such as the charge carrier transport and light outcoupling efficiency, are usually overlooked and not well optimized. Here, ultrahigh&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs are reported with quantum efficiencies surpassing a milestone of 30% by regulating the charge carrier transport and near&#8208;field light distribution to reduce electron leakage and achieve a high light outcoupling efficiency of 41.82%. Ni0.9Mg0.1Ox films are applied with a high refractive index and increased hole carrier mobility as the hole injection layer to balance the charge carrier injection and insert the polyethylene glycol layer between the hole transport layer and the perovskite emissive layer to block the electron leakage and reduce the photon loss. Therefore, with the modified structure, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art green PeLEDs achieve a world record external quantum efficiency of 30.84% (average&#160;=&#160;&#8201;29.05&#160;&#177;&#160;0.77%) at a luminance of 6514&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This study provides an interesting idea to construct super high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs by balancing the electron&#8208;hole recombination and enhancing the light outcoupling.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Uniform and Functionalized Nano&#8208;Ion Divider for Regulating Ion Distribution toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional ion&#8208;divider (M&#8208;NC@MXene) with homogeneous nanopores and doped single atoms is designed and fabricated to enable physical and chemical redistribution of Li ions, impede the transport of anions, and prevent the formation of Li dendrites in various Li&#8208;metal battery systems. The multifunctionality of the divider is validated through experiments, first&#8208;principles simulations, and phase&#8208;field modeling.








Abstract
Ionic dividers with uniform pores and functionalized surfaces display significant potential for solving Li&#8208;dendrite issues in Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, single metal and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;sandwiched MXene (M&#8208;NC@MXene) nanosheets are designed and fabricated, which possess highly ordered nanochannels with a diameter of &#8776;10&#160;nm. The experiments and computational calculations verified that the M&#8208;NC@MXene nanosheets eliminate Li dendrites in several ways: (1) redistributing the Li&#8208;ion flux via the highly ordered ion channels, (2) selectively conducting Li ions and anchoring anions by heteroatom doping to extend the nucleation time for Li dendrites, and (3) tightly staggering on a routine polypropylene (PP) separator to obstruct the growth path of Li dendrites. With a Zn&#8208;NC@MXene&#8208;coated PP divider, the assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows an ultralow overpotential of &#8776;25&#160;mV and a cycle life of 1500&#160;h at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, the life of a Li||Ni83 pouch cell with an energy density of 305&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is improved by fivefold. Moreover, the remarkable performance of Li||Li, Li||LiFePO4, and Li||sulfur batteries reveal the significant potential of the well&#8208;designed multifunctional ion divider for further practical applications.

         <title>Combining PEDOT:PSS Polymer Coating with Metallic 3D Nanowires Electrodes to Achieve High Electrochemical Performances for Neuronal Interfacing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of a meticulously controlled, highly selective electrodeposited PEDOT:PSS layer onto 3D nanowire electrodes has yielded notable improvements in electrochemical performance. Specifically, this nanoscale&#8208;controlled coating has significantly reduced the interface impedance and enhanced the stimulation capability in comparison to interfaces coated with metallic materials.








Abstract
This study presents a novel approach to improve the performance of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) used for electrophysiological studies of neuronal networks. The integration of 3D nanowires (NWs) with MEAs increases the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which enables subcellular interactions and high&#8208;resolution neuronal signal recording. However, these devices suffer from high initial interface impedance and limited charge transfer capacity due to their small effective area. To overcome these limitations, the integration of conductive polymer coatings, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is investigated as a mean of improving the charge transfer capacity and biocompatibility of MEAs. The study combines platinum silicide&#8208;based metallic 3D nanowires electrodes with electrodeposited PEDOT:PSS coatings to deposit ultra&#8208;thin (&lt;50 nm) layers of conductive polymer onto metallic electrodes with very high selectivity. The polymer&#8208;coated electrodes&#160;were&#160;fully characterized electrochemically and morphologically to establish a direct relationship between synthesis conditions, morphology, and conductive features. Results show that PEDOT&#8208;coated electrodes exhibit thickness&#8208;dependent improved stimulation and recording performances, offering new perspectives for neuronal interfacing with optimal cell engulfment to enable the study of neuronal activity with acute spatial and signal resolution at the sub&#8208;cellular level.

         <title>Linker Engineering of Sandwich&#8208;Structured Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites for Optimized Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>

Sandwich&#8208;like UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = &#9472;H, &#9472;Br, &#9472;NA (naphthalene for short), &#9472;OCH3, &#9472;Cl, &#9472;NO2) composites are constructed for visible&#8208;light photocatalytic H2 production. The &#9472;X group reversely regulates the charge separation of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, giving rise to a volcano&#8208;like activity trend of the composites along with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the &#9472;X group.








Abstract
While the microenvironment around catalytic sites is recognized to be crucial in thermocatalysis, its roles in photocatalysis remain subtle. In this work, a series of sandwich&#8208;structured metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composites, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X means functional groups), is rationally constructed for visible&#8208;light photocatalytic H2 production. By varying the &#9472;X groups of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X shell, the microenvironment of the Pt sites and photosensitive UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core can be simultaneously modulated. Significantly, the MOF composites with identical light absorption and Pt loading present distinctly different photocatalytic H2 production rates, following the &#9472;X group sequence of &#9472;H&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;Br&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;NA (naphthalene)&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;OCH3&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;Cl&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;NO2. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H demonstrates H2 production rate up to 2708.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;222 times that of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2. Mechanism investigations suggest that the variation of the &#9472;X group can balance the charge separation of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, leading to an optimal activity of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H at the equilibrium point.

UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Pt@UiO-66-H demonstrates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate up to 2708.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8776;222 times that of UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Pt@UiO-66-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanism investigations suggest that the variation of the &#9472;X group can balance the charge separation of the UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, leading to an optimal activity of UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Pt@UiO-66-H at the equilibrium point.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Chemistry as a Universal Strategy for a Controlled Perovskite Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a green solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used in the processing of perovskite to control its morphology and orientation. Unfortunately, the highly coordinating DMSO is not easily expelled from the thin films, which negatively affects the long&#8208;term stability of resulting perovskite solar cells. In this work, dimethyl sulfide is introduced to facilitate perovskite formation by expelling the DMSO from the DMSO&#8208;intermediate phase compositions.








Abstract
The most efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are made from a complex mixture of precursors. Typically, to then form a thin film, an extreme oversaturation of the perovskite precursor is initiated to trigger nucleation sites, e.g., by vacuum, an airstream, or a so&#8208;called antisolvent. Unfortunately, most oversaturation triggers do not expel the lingering (and highly coordinating) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is used as a precursor solvent, from the thin films; this detrimentally affects long&#8208;term stability. In this work, (the green) dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is introduced as a novel nucleation trigger for perovskite films combining, uniquely, high coordination and high vapor pressure. This gives DMS a universal scope: DMS replaces other solvents by coordinating more strongly and removes itself once the film formation is finished. To demonstrate this novel coordination chemistry approach, MAPbI3 PSCs are processed, typically dissolved in hard&#8208;to&#8208;remove (and green) DMSO achieving 21.6% efficiency, among the highest reported efficiencies for this system. To confirm the universality of the strategy, DMS is tested for FAPbI3 as another composition, which shows higher efficiency of 23.5% compared to 20.9% for a device fabricated with chlorobenzene. This work provides a universal strategy to control perovskite crystallization using coordination chemistry, heralding the revival of perovskite compositions with pure DMSO.

         <title>Realization and Control of Bulk and Surface Modes in 3D Nanomagnonic Networks by Additive Manufacturing of Ferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ferromagnetic nanodevices are expected to provide enhanced functionality for data storage, magnonics, and spintronics. An additive manufacturing methodology for ferromagnetic Ni is reported by which different networks of 3D interconnected nanotubes are produced. The structures show engineered magnon modes at surprisingly high GHz frequencies and a clear discrepancy between bulk and surface states, opening new perspectives in magnonics.








Abstract
The high&#8208;density integration in information technology fuels the research on functional 3D nanodevices. Particularly ferromagnets promise multifunctional 3D devices for nonvolatile data storage, high&#8208;speed data processing, and non&#8208;charge&#8208;based logic operations via spintronics and magnonics concepts. However, 3D nanofabrication of ferromagnets is extremely challenging. In this work, an additive manufacturing methodology is reported, and unprecedented 3D ferromagnetic nanonetworks with a woodpile&#8208;structure unit cell are fabricated. The collective spin dynamics (magnons) at frequencies up to 25 GHz are investigated by Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations. A clear discrepancy of about 10 GHz is found between the bulk and surface modes, which are engineered by different unit cell sizes in the Ni&#8208;based nanonetworks. The angle&#8208; and spatially&#8208;dependent modes demonstrate opportunities for multi&#8208;frequency signal processing in 3D circuits via magnons. The developed synthesis route will allow one to create 3D magnonic crystals with chiral unit cells, which are a prerequisite toward surface modes with topologically protected&#160;properties.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Exciton Mechanism and AIE Effect Boost the Performance of Deep&#8208;Red Emitters in Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy achieves hot exciton fluorescence with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties via elevation of the first singlet excited state by modulating the conjugation length of the acceptor unit to match the energy of high&#8208;lying triplet states. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter DT&#8208;IPD affords deep&#8208;red non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diode at 685 nm with an external quantum efficiency of 12.2%.








Abstract
Luminescent materials possessing a &#8220;hot&#8208;exciton&#8221; mechanism and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) qualities are well&#8208;suited for use as emitting materials in nondoped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), particularly in deep&#8208;red regions where their ground state and singlet excited state surfaces are in proximity, leading to the formation of multiple nonradiative channels. However, designing molecules that artificially combine the hot&#8208;exciton mechanism and AIE attributes remains a formidable task. In this study, a versatile strategy is presented to achieve hot&#8208;exciton fluorescence with AIE property by increasing the first singlet excited (S1) state through modulation of the conjugation length of the newly created acceptor unit, matching the energy level of high&#8208;lying triplet (Tn) states, and enhancing exciton utilization efficiency by employing suitable donor moieties. This approach reduces the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in the aggregate state, resulting in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter DT&#8208;IPD, which produces an unprecedented external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.2% and Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage&#160;(CIE)&#160;coordinates of (0.69, 0.30) in a deep&#8208;red non&#8208;doped OLED at 685&#160;nm, representing the highest performance among all deep&#8208;red OLEDs based on materials with hot&#8208;exciton mechanisms. This work provides novel insights into the design of more efficient hot&#8208;exciton emitters with AIE properties.

         <title>Integrated Construction of a Long&#8208;Life Stretchable Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a series of physicochemically tunable self&#8208;healing polyurethanes, an elastic current collector with &#8220;geometric&#8208;intrinsic&#8221; dual stretchability is prepared through a swelling&#8208;induced wrinkling method, and a stretchable zinc negative electrode with triple&#8208;layer coaxial heterostructure is further prepared through in situ confined electroplating. Furthermore, fully polyurethane&#8208;based stretchable zinc&#8208;ion capacitors are assembled through in situ electrospinning and hot&#8208;pressing techniques. Due to the high stretchability of the components and the interfusion of the matrixes, the device exhibits excellent deformability and desirable electrochemical stability.








Abstract
The major challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance stretchable zinc&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage devices is the combination of stretchable dendrite&#8208;free zinc negative electrodes and sufficient bonding between components (current collector, electrode, separator, and package). Herein, based on a series of physicochemically tunable self&#8208;healing polyurethanes, an elastic current collector is prepared through a swelling&#8208;induced wrinkling method, and then a stretchable zinc negative electrode prepared through in situ confined electroplating. The elastic current collector has a nano&#8208;network structure with polyurethane encapsulation, and exhibits both geometric and intrinsic stretchability. The stretchable zinc negative electrode formed in situ has high electrochemical activity and exhibits an excellent cycle life under the protection of a Zn2+&#8208;permeable coating. Furthermore, fully polyurethane&#8208;based stretchable zinc&#8208;ion capacitors are assembled through in situ electrospinning and hot&#8208;pressing techniques. Due to the high stretchability of the components and the interfusion of the matrixes, the integrated device exhibits excellent deformability and desirable electrochemical stability. This work provides a systematic construction plan for stretchable zinc&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage devices in three aspects: material synthesis, component preparation, and device assembly.

         <title>Spatially Confined Silver Nanoparticles in Mercapto Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Compartmentalize Li Deposition Toward Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, Ag nanoparticles are chemically implanted into mercapto&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and the lithiophilic assemblies are utilized to modify Cu current collector for achieving reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping. Owing to the compartmentalized Li storage, symmetric and full cells demonstrate prolonged cycling over 1500 and 1000&#160;cycles, respectively, with a near&#8208;unity Coulombic efficiency.








Abstract
As the promising next&#8208;generation energy storage solution, lithium metal battery (LMB) has gained great attention but still suffers from troubles associated with the highly active metallic lithium. Herein, it is&#160;aimed to develop an anode&#8208;free LMB engaging no Li disk or foil by modifying the Cu current collector with mercapto metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) impregnating Ag nanoparticles (NPs). While the polar mercapto groups facilitate and guide Li+ transport, the highly lithiophilic Ag NPs help to enhance the electric conductivity and lower the energy barrier of Li nucleation. Furthermore, the MOF pores allow compartmentalizing bulk Li into a 3D matrix Li storage so that not only the local current density is reduced, but also is the plating/stripping reversibility greatly enhanced. As a result, full cells pairing the prelithiated Ag@Zr&#8208;DMBD/Cu anodes with LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a high initial specific capacity of 159.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency of 96.6%, and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 1000&#160;cycles with 99.3% capacity retention at 1&#160;C. This study underlines the multi&#8208;aspect functionalization of MOFs to impart lithiophilicity, polarity, and porosity to achieve reversible Li plating/stripping and paves the way for realizing high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free LMBs through exquisite modification of the Cu current collector.

         <title>Superflexible Artificial Soft Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial soft wood (ASW) can be fabricated through the cork&#8208;inspired soft&#8208;in&#8208;rigid compositional strategy, taking advantage of freeze&#8208;casting rubber&#8208;in&#8208;resin emulsion. Thermal curing induces demulsification and phase inversion, leading to a superflexible wood&#8208;like material with discrete rigid islands in soft matrix. ASW exhibits wide&#8208;angle deformation capacity and high structural stability, achieving the trade&#8208;off in&#8208;between superflexibility and robustness.








Abstract
Soft woods have attracted enormous interest due to their anisotropic cellular microstructure and unique flexibility. The conventional wood&#8208;like materials are usually subject to the conflict between the superflexibility and robustness. Inspired by the synergistic compositions of soft suberin and rigid lignin of cork wood which has good flexibility and mechanical robustness, an artificial soft wood is reported by freeze&#8208;casting the soft&#8208;in&#8208;rigid (rubber&#8208;in&#8208;resin) emulsions, where the carboxy nitrile rubber confers softness and rigid melamine resin provides stiffness. The subsequent thermal curing induces micro&#8208;scale phase inversion and leads to a continuous soft phase strengthened by interspersed rigid ingredients. The unique configuration ensures crack resistance, structural robustness and superb flexibility, including wide&#8208;angle bending, twisting, and stretching abilities in various directions, as well as excellent fatigue resistance and high strength, overwhelming the natural soft wood and most wood&#8208;inspired materials. This superflexible artificial soft wood represents a promising substrate for bending&#8208;insensitive stress sensors.

         <title>Exotic Electronic Properties of 2D Nanosheets Isolated from Liquid Phase Exfoliated Phyllosilicate Minerals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation is applied to common layered phyllosilicate crystals of mica and chlorite schist to fabricate high&#8208;yield nanosheet suspensions. Once commonly believed to be spectrally inactive, electrically insulating, and chemically inert, suspensions of micene and chlorene nanosheets are shown to have unique spectral fingerprints, tuneable bandgaps, and superlative electrochemical performances for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Spectrally inactive, electrically insulating, and chemically inert are adjectives broadly used to describe phyllosilicate minerals like mica and chlorite. Here, the above is disproved by demonstrating aqueous suspensions of liquid exfoliated nanosheets from five bulk mica types and chlorite schist. Nanosheet quality is confirmed via transmission electron and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as electron diffraction. Through Raman spectroscopy, a previously unreported size&#8208; and layer&#8208;dependent spectral fingerprint is observed. When analyzing the high&#8208;yield suspensions (&#8776;1&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) through UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, all phyllosilicates present bandgap (Eg) narrowing from &#8776;7&#160;eV in the bulk to &#8776;4&#160;eV for monolayers. Unusually, the bandgap is inversely proportional to the areal size (A) of the nanosheets, measured via atomic force microscopy. Due to an unrecorded quantum confinement effect, nanosheet electronic properties scale toward semiconducting behavior (bandgap &#8776;3&#160;eV) as nanosheet area increases. Furthermore, modeling X&#8208;ray diffraction spectra shows that the root cause of the initial bandgap narrowing is lattice relaxation. Finally, with their broad range of isomorphically substituted ions, phyllosilicate nanosheets show remarkable catalytic properties for hydrogen production.

         <title>Tunable, Wide&#8208;Temperature, and Macroscale Superlubricity Enabled by Nanoscale Van Der Waals Heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;Homojunction Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By van der Waals (vdW) composite (graphene/MoS2 etc.) nanopowder&#8208;to&#8208;heterojunction conversion under graphene edge&#8208;oxygen incorporation, a coexistent structure of nanoscale homojunctions and heterojunctions is formed on the grinding balls. Tunable, wide&#8208;temperature (&#8722;200 to 300&#160;&#176;C) and macroscale superlubricity (0.005) is achieved on diamond&#8208;like carbon surfaces by nanoscale vdW heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation unlike traditional incommensurability&#8208;to&#8208;commensurability theory.








Abstract
Achieving macroscale superlubricity of van der Waals (vdW) nanopowders is particularly challenging, due to the difficulty in forming ordered junctions before friction and the friction&#8208;induced complex contact restructuration among multiple nanometer&#8208;sized junctions. Here, a facile way is reported to achieve vdW nanopowder&#8208;to&#8208;heterojunction conversion by graphene edge&#8208;oxygen (GEO) incorporation. The GEO effectively weakens the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane edge&#8211;edge and in&#8208;plane plane&#8211;edge states of the vdW nanopowder, leading to a coexistent structure of nanoscale homojunctions and heterojunctions on the grinding balls. When sliding on diamond&#8208;like carbon surfaces, the ball&#8208;supported structure governs macroscale superlubricity by heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation among the countless nanoscale junctions. Furthermore, the transformation guides the tunable design of superlubricity, achieving superlubricity (&#181;&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.005) at wide ranges of load, velocity, and temperature (&#8722;200 to 300&#160;&#176;C). Atomistic simulations reveal the GEO&#8208;enhanced conversion of vdW nanopowder to heterojunctions and demonstrate the heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation superlubricity mechanism. The findings are of significance for the macroscopic scale&#8208;up and engineering application of structural superlubricity.

         <title>Conventional Non&#8208;Fluorescent Polymers: Unconventional Security Inks for Data Storage and Multidimensional Photonic Cryptography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly secure photonic cryptography based on the non&#8208;fluorescent polymer inks, rather than conventional fluorescent/phosphorescent inks, is developed. The stored data in the polymer inks can only be lit up&#160;by a anti&#8208;rigidochromic fluorophore, with their emission wavelength, intensity, and chirality prescribed by the polymer structures. Therefore, the data is triply encrypted and naturally gains a much higher security level.








Abstract
Traditional security inks relying on fluorescent/phosphorescent molecules are facing increasing risks of forgery or tampering due to their simple readout scheme (i.e., UV&#8208;light irradiation) and the advancement of counterfeiting technologies. In this work, a multidimensional data&#8208;encryption method based on non&#8208;fluorescent polymers via a &#8220;lock&#8211;key&#8221; mechanism is developed. The non&#8208;fluorescent invisible polymer inks serve as the &#8220;lock&#8221; for data&#8208;encryption, while the anti&#8208;rigidochromic fluorophores that can distinctively light up the polymer inks with programed emissions are &#8220;keys&#8221; for decryption. The emission of decrypted data is prescribed by polymer chemical structure, molecular weight, topology, copolymer sequence, and phase structure, and shows distinct intensity, wavelength, and chirality compared with the intrinsic emission of fluorophores. Therefore, the data is triply encrypted and naturally gains a high&#8208;security level, e.g., only one out of 20&#160;000 keys can access the only correct readout from 40&#160;000&#160;000 possible outputs in a three&#8208;polymers&#8208;based data&#8208;encryption matrix. Note that fluorophores lacking anti&#8208;rigidochrimism cannot selectively light up the inks and fail in data&#8208;decryption. Further, the diverse topologies, less well&#8208;defined structures, and random&#8208;coiled shapes of polymers make it impossible for them to be imitated. This work offers a new design for security inks and boosts data security levels beyond the reach of conventional fluorescent inks.

&lt;p&gt;Traditional security inks relying on fluorescent/phosphorescent molecules are facing increasing risks of forgery or tampering due to their simple readout scheme (i.e., UV-light irradiation) and the advancement of counterfeiting technologies.

         <title>NbTe4 Phase&#8208;Change Material: Breaking the Phase&#8208;Change Temperature Balance in 2D Van der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Binary Chalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores chalcogen&#8208;rich 2D transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;chalcogenides' potential for phase&#8208;change memory. The focus is on the layered TM&#8208;chalcogenide NbTe4, showing a lower melting point and higher crystallization temperature than traditional phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5. Further device evaluation demonstrates that NbTe4 is an excellent solution for current PCM issueslike poor thermal stability and the high Reset energy.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) transition metal di&#8208;chalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention in the nonvolatile memory field for their tunable electrical properties, scalability, and potential for phase engineering. However, their complex switching mechanism and complicated fabrication methods pose challenges for mass production. Sputtering is a promising technique for large&#8208;area 2D vdW TMD fabrication, but the high melting point (typically Tm &gt; 1000 &#176;C) of TMDs requires elevated temperatures for good crystallinity. This study focuses on the low&#8208;Tm 2D vdW TM tetra&#8208;chalcogenides and identifies NbTe4 as a promising candidate with an ultra&#8208;low Tm of around 447 &#176;C (onset temperature). As&#8208;grown NbTe4 forms an amorphous phase upon deposition that can be crystallized by annealing at temperatures above 272 &#176;C. The simultaneous presence of a low Tm and a high crystallization temperature Tc can resolve important issues facing current phase&#8208;change memory compounds, such as high Reset energies and poor thermal stability of the amorphous phase. Therefore, NbTe4 holds great promise as a potential solution to these issues.

         <title>Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Dry Reforming of Methane on a Rh/LaNiO3 Catalyst through a Light&#8208;induced Metal&#8208;To&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an environmental friendly way to convert greenhouse gas to useful syngas, but a high light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) is still hard to achieve under mild conditions. By regulating the progresses of adsorption, activation, and oxygen migration, a high LTCEE of 10.72% is obtained under moderate irradiation using Rh/LaNiO3 as catalyst.








Abstract
As an energy&#8208;saving and green method, solar&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane (DRM) is expected to introduce new activation processes and prevent sintering and coking of the catalysts. However, it still lacks an efficient way to coordinate the regulation of activation of reactants and lattice oxygen migration. In this study, Rh/LaNiO3 is designed as a highly efficient photothermal catalyst for solar&#8208;driven DRM, which performs production rates of 452.3&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gRh&#8722;1 for H2 and 527.6&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gRh&#8722;1 for CO2 under a light intensity of 1.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, with an excellent stability. Moreover, a remarkable light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 10.72% is achieved under a light intensity of 3.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. The characterizations of surface electronic and chemical properties and theoretical analysis demonstrate that strong adsorption for CH4 and CO2, light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) process and high oxygen mobility together bring Rh/LaNiO3 excellent performance for solar&#8208;driven DRM.

         <title>Probing Optical Multi&#8208;Level Memory Effects in Single Core&#8208;Shell Quantum Dots and Application Through 2D&#8211;0D Hybrid Inverters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs), for the first time a 2D&#8211;0D hybrid&#8208;based optical multi&#8208;level memory (OMM) effect is observed. The OMM devices show that a single QD has the ability to maintain different memory levels. Based on the phenomenon, an OMM inverter consisting of two 2D&#8211;0D hybrid OMM devices is proposed to implement programming and erasing with laser pulses only. Finally, using a convolutional neural network composed of the OMM inverter set, the feasibility of applying the inverters as synapses is evaluated in a fully optically&#8208;controlled intelligent system via training and inference tasks using the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset.








Abstract
Challenges in the development of a multi&#8208;level memory (MM)&#160;device for multinary arithmetic computers have posed an obstacle to low&#8208;power, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;speed operation. For the effective transfer of a huge amount of data between arithmetic and storage devices, optical communication technology represents a compelling solution. Here, by replicating a floating gate architecture with CdSe/ZnS type&#8208;I core/shell quantum dots (QDs), a 2D&#8211;0D hybrid optical multi&#8208;level memory (OMM) device operated is demonstrated by laser pulses. In the device, laser pulses create linear optically trapped currents with MM characteristics, while conversely, voltage pulses reset all the trapped currents at once. Assuming electron transfer via the energy band alignment between MoS2 and CdSe, the study also establishes the mechanism of the OMM effect. Analysis of the designed device led to a new hypothesis that charge transfer is difficult for laterally adjacent QDs facing a double ZnS shell, which is tested by separately stimulating different positions on the 2D&#8211;0D hybrid structure with finely focused laser pulses. Results indicate that each laser pulse induced independent MM characteristics in the 2D&#8211;0D hybrid architecture. Based on this phenomenon,&#160;we&#160;propose a MM inverter to produce MM effects, such as programming and erasing, solely through the use of laser pulses. Finally, the feasibility of a fully optically&#8208;controlled intelligent system based on the proposed OMM inverters is evaluated through a CIFAR&#8208;10 pattern recognition task using a convolutional neural network.

         <title>Target Therapy for Buried Interface Enables Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.05% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and effective strategy, i.e., target therapy of buried interface via incorporating formamidine oxalate in colloidal SnO2, is developed. Both formamidinium and oxalate ions show longitudinal gradient distribution with the highest concentration on the SnO2 film surface after annealing, which enables matched energy levels, high&#8208;quality upper perovskite films, and minimized defects. The perovskite solar cells deliver a high efficiency of 25.05% with enhanced device stability.








Abstract
The buried interface in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is pivotal for achieving high efficiency and stability. However, it is challenging to study and optimize the buried interface due to its non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, a facile and effective strategy is developed to modify the SnO2/perovskite buried interface by passivating the buried defects in perovskite and modulating carrier dynamics via incorporating formamidine oxalate (FOA) in SnO2 nanoparticles. Both formamidinium and oxalate ions show a longitudinal gradient distribution in the SnO2 layer, mainly accumulating at the SnO2/perovskite buried interface, which enables high&#8208;quality upper perovskite films, minimized defects, superior interface contacts, and matched energy levels between perovskite and SnO2. Significantly, FOA can simultaneously reduce the oxygen vacancies and tin interstitial defects on the SnO2 surface and the FA+/Pb2+ associated defects at the perovskite buried interface. Consequently, the FOA treatment significantly improves the efficiency of the PSCs from 22.40% to 25.05% and their storage&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. This method provides an effective target therapy of buried interface in PSCs to achieve very high efficiency and stability.

         <title>Component Distribution Regulation in Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells through Selective Molecular Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disordered Sn/Pb ratio and heterojunctions in perovskite film can be suppressed through selective molecular interaction. Hydrazine sulfate (HS) is introduced in Sn perovskite precursor and reduces the crystallization rate of tin perovskite to the level of lead analog. Therefore, a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite film with uniform component and energy distribution, as well as devices with low recombination loss are achieved.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with near&#8208;ideal bandgap still lag behind the pure lead PSCs. Disordered heterojunctions caused by inhomogeneous Sn/Pb ratio in the binary perovskite film induce large recombination loss. Here, an Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite film is reported with homogeneous component and energy distribution by introducing hydrazine sulfate (HS) in Sn perovskite precursor. HS can form hydrogen bond network and coordinate with FASnI3 thus no longer bond with Pb2+, which reduces the crystallization rate of tin perovskite to the level of lead analog. The strong bonding between SO42&#8722; and Sn2+ can also suppress its oxidation. As a result, the Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with HS exhibit a significantly improved VOC of 0.91 V along with a high efficiency of 23.17%. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bond interaction network, strong bonding between Sn2+ and sulfate ion also improve the thermal, storage, and air stability of resulting devices.

         <title>Robust and Sustainable Indium Anode Leading to Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is developed, achieving the impressive PCE of 18.92% and 15.20%, respectively. This interlayer significantly extends the thermal stability of derived OSCs with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;10&#160;000 h.








The fast degradation of the charge&#8208;extraction interface at indium tin oxide (ITO) poses a significant obstacle to achieving long&#8208;term stability for organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is developed. It is revealed that the recovered indium chloride (InCl3) from indium oxide waste can be applied as an effective hole&#8208;selective interfacial layer for the ITO electrode (noted as InCl3&#8211;ITO anode) through simple aqueous fabrication, facilitating not only energy level alignment to photoactive blends but also mitigating parasitic absorption and charge recombination losses of the corresponding OSCs. As a result, OSCs and modules consisting of InCl3&#8211;ITO anodes achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.92% and 15.20% (active area of 18.73 cm2), respectively. More importantly, the InCl3&#8211;ITO anode can significantly extend the thermal stability of derived OSCs, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime of &#8776;10&#160;000 h.

         <title>Curbing Exosome Communications via Introducing Artificial Membrane Receptors for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ac4ManNAz&#8208;DP nanoparticles first generate receptor&#8208;like azide groups on the membranes of pancreatic tumor cells and tumor derived exosomes by metabolic glycoengineering. DBCO&#8208;GEM/ISO&#8208;DP nanoparticles then can precisely bind to the azide&#8208;labeled tumor cells and tumor derived exosomes via bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry, thus suppressing the primary tumors and the exosome communications between primary tumors and distal organs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (TDEs) carry various biomolecular cargos and play crucial roles in metastasis. TDEs migrate to distal organs for intercellular communication and induce the formation of pre&#8208;metastatic niches (PMNs) to support tumor implantation and proliferation. Precise interference in the bioprocess of TDEs is expected to be efficacious for suppressing tumor metastasis. However, targeting both TDEs and the primary tumor is challenging. Here, based on metabolic glycoengineering and bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry, a two&#8208;step delivery strategy is designed to overcome this. During the first step, the tetraacetylated&#160;N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;d&#8208;mannosamine&#8208;loaded nanoparticle responds to the metabolic activity of tumor cells in the primary tumor, tagging both tumor cells and TDEs with azide groups; dibenzyl&#8208;cyclootyne&#8208;modified nanoparticles then can, as the second step, specifically react with tumor cells and TDEs through a bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. This strategy not only inhibits tumor growth in pancreatic cancer models but also curbs the communicative role of TDEs in inducing liver PMNs and metastasis by tracking and downregulating the exosomal macrophage migration inhibitory factor.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Control of Cycloidal Spin Order in a Metallic Van der Waals Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic and reversible control of cycloidal spin order with strains is demonstrated in the metallic van der Waals magnet Cr1/3TaS2 via strain&#8208;induced Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The remarkable tunability of Cr1/3TaS2 exemplifies the great potential of layered chiral magnets for highly&#8208;efficient straintronic applications.








Abstract
The manipulation of magnetism through strain control is a captivating area of research with potential applications for low&#8208;power devices that do not require dissipative currents. Recent investigations of insulating multiferroics have unveiled tunable relationships among polar lattice distortions, Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions (DMI), and cycloidal spin orders that break inversion symmetry. These findings have raised the possibility of utilizing strain or strain gradient to manipulate intricate magnetic states by changing polarization. However, the effectiveness of manipulating cycloidal spin orders in &#8220;metallic&#8221; materials with screened magnetism&#8208;relevant electric polarization remains uncertain. In this study, the reversible strain control of cycloidal spin textures in a metallic van der Waals magnet, Cr1/3TaS2, through the modulation of polarization and DMI induced by strain is demonstrated. With thermally&#8208;induced biaxial strains and isothermally&#8208;applied uniaxial strains, systematic manipulation of the sign and wavelength of the cycloidal spin textures is realized, respectively. Additionally, unprecedented reflectivity reduction under strain and domain modification at a record&#8208;low current density are also discovered. These findings establish a connection between polarization and cycloidal spins in metallic materials and present a new avenue for utilizing the remarkable tunability of cycloidal magnetic textures and optical functionality in van der Waals metals with strain.

&lt;p&gt;Systematic and reversible control of cycloidal spin order with strains is demonstrated in the metallic van der Waals magnet Cr&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The remarkable tunability of Cr&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exemplifies the great potential of layered chiral magnets for highly-efficient straintronic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with Controlled Anisotropy using Surface&#8208;Selective Ligand Pairs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are synthesized with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding affinity on different surface facets of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are revealed. This study provides design rules for the further exploration of anisotropic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals.








Abstract
Mechanistic studies of the morphology of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP&#8208;NCs) are hampered by a lack of generalizable suitable synthetic strategies and ligand systems. Here, the synthesis of zwitterionic CsPbBr3 NCs is presented with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Such a strategy provides a platform to systematically study the binding affinity of capping ligand pairs and the resulting LHP morphologies. By using zwitterionic ligands (ZwL) with varying structures, majority ZwL&#8208;capped LHP NCs with controlled morphology are obtained, including anisotropic nanoplatelets and nanorods, for the first time. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding on the different surface facets of LHP&#8208;NCs are revealed, including the steric bulkiness of the ligand, the number of binding sites, and the charge distance between binding moieties. This study provides guidance for the further exploration of anisotropic LHP&#8208;NCs.

         <title>Unraveling Size&#8208;Dependent Ion&#8208;Migration for Stable Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile path toward high&#8208;quality mixed&#8208;halide perovskites without halide segregation is developed. Two factors contribute to this improvement: composition homogeneity is a prerequisite for realizing high thermodynamic stability, and further reduction of the grain size strengthens the ability to resist stimuli. Consequently, efficient and color&#8208;stable deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 and yellow CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PeLEDs are presented, showing the potential for full&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays and solid&#8208;state lighting.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskites show tunable emission wavelength across the visible&#8208;light range, with optimum control of the light color. However, color stability remains limited due to the notorious halide segregation under illumination or an electric field. Here, a versatile path toward high&#8208;quality mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with high emission properties and resistance to halide segregation is presented. Through systematic in and ex situ characterizations, key features for this advancement are proposed: a slowed and controllable crystallization process can promote achievement of halide homogeneity, which in turn ensures thermodynamic stability; meanwhile, downsizing perovskite nanoparticle to nanometer&#8208;scale dimensions can enhance their resistance to external stimuli, strengthening the phase stability. Leveraging this strategy, devices are developed based on CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 perovskite that achieves a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.8% at 464&#160;nm, making it one of the most efficient deep&#8208;blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to date. Particularly, the device demonstrates excellent spectral stability, maintaining a constant emission profile and position for over 60 min of continuous operation. The versatility of this approach with CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PeLEDs is further showcased, achieving an impressive EQE of 12.7% at 576&#160;nm.

Based on vat photopolymerization 3D printing, the fabrication of dynamic cross&#8208;linked material functionalized with reversibly cleavable covalent bonds upon exposure to light and high&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound is realized. This approach opens a new avenue for developing sustainable new methodologies for pinpoint modification, healing, and reshaping of dynamic cross&#8208;linked materials.








Abstract
Advances in vat photopolymerization (VP) 3D printing (3DP) technology enable the production of highly precise 3D objects. However, it is a major challenge to create dynamic functionalities and to manipulate the physical properties of the inherently insoluble and infusible cross&#8208;linked material generated from VP&#8208;3DP without reproduction. The fabrication of light&#8208; and high&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)&#8208;responsive cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials linked with hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) in polymer chains based on VP&#8208;3DP is reported here. Although the photochemistry of HABI produces triphenylimidazolyl radicals (TPIRs) during the process of VP&#8208;3DP, the orthogonality of the photochemistry of HABI and photopolymerization enables the introduction of reversible cross&#8208;links derived from HABIs in the resulting 3D&#8208;printed objects. While photostimulation cleaves a covalent bond between two imidazoles in HABI to generate TPIRs only near the surface of the 3D&#8208;printed objects, HIFU triggers cleavage in the interior of materials. In addition, HIFU travels beyond an obstacle to induce a response of HABI&#8208;embedded cross&#8208;linked polymers, which cannot be attainable with photostimulation. The present system would be beneficial for tuning the physical properties and recycling of various polymeric materials, but it will also open the door for pinpoint modification, healing, and reshaping of materials when coupled to various dynamic covalent materials.

Excessive inflammatory reactions caused by uric acid deposition are the key factor leading to gout. However, clinical medications cannot simultaneously remove uric acid and eliminate inflammation. An M2 macrophage&#8208;erythrocyte hybrid membrane&#8208;camouflaged biomimetic nanosized liposome is engineered to deliver targeted self&#8208;cascading bienzymes and an immunomodulator to reprogram the inflammatory microenvironment for enhanced enzyme&#8208;thermo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Excessive inflammatory reactions caused by uric acid deposition are the key factor leading to gout. However, clinical medications cannot simultaneously remove uric acid and eliminate inflammation. An M2 macrophage&#8208;erythrocyte hybrid membrane&#8208;camouflaged biomimetic nanosized liposome (USM[H]L) is engineered to deliver targeted self&#8208;cascading bienzymes and immunomodulators to reprogram the inflammatory microenvironment in gouty rats. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating endow nanosomes with good immune escape and lysosomal escape to achieve long circulation time and intracellular retention times. After being uptaken by inflammatory cells, synergistic enzyme&#8208;thermo&#8208;immunotherapies are achieved: uricase and nanozyme degraded uric acid and hydrogen peroxide, respectively; bienzymes improved the catalytic abilities of each other; nanozyme produced photothermal effects; and methotrexate has immunomodulatory and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. The uric acid levels markedly decrease, and ankle swelling and claw curling are effectively alleviated. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS decrease, while the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels increase. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages are reprogrammed to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. Notably, the IgG and IgM levels in USM[H]L&#8208;treated rats decrease substantially, while uricase&#8208;treated rats show high immunogenicity. Proteomic analysis show that there are 898 downregulated and 725 upregulated differentially expressed proteins in USM[H]L&#8208;treated rats. The protein&#8208;protein interaction network indicates that the signaling pathways include the spliceosome, ribosome, purine metabolism, etc.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammatory reactions caused by uric acid deposition are the key factor leading to gout. However, clinical medications cannot simultaneously remove uric acid and eliminate inflammation. An M2 macrophage-erythrocyte hybrid membrane-camouflaged biomimetic nanosized liposome (USM[H]L) is engineered to deliver targeted self-cascading bienzymes and immunomodulators to reprogram the inflammatory microenvironment in gouty rats. The cell-membrane-coating endow nanosomes with good immune escape and lysosomal escape to achieve long circulation time and intracellular retention times. After being uptaken by inflammatory cells, synergistic enzyme-thermo-immunotherapies are achieved: uricase and nanozyme degraded uric acid and hydrogen peroxide, respectively; bienzymes improved the catalytic abilities of each other; nanozyme produced photothermal effects; and methotrexate has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The uric acid levels markedly decrease, and ankle swelling and claw curling are effectively alleviated. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS decrease, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels increase. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages are reprogrammed to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Notably, the IgG and IgM levels in USM[H]L-treated rats decrease substantially, while uricase-treated rats show high immunogenicity. Proteomic analysis show that there are 898 downregulated and 725 upregulated differentially expressed proteins in USM[H]L-treated rats. The protein-protein interaction network indicates that the signaling pathways include the spliceosome, ribosome, purine metabolism, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Strain Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Formamidinium Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PYBA cation is used as a template for the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskite, which induces a highly oriented crystal and a pure &#945;&#8208;phase film. The external compression strain provided by the PYBA pairs compensates for the inherent tension strain of the FAPbI3 crystals. As a result, the strain&#8208;regulated formamidinium PSC exhibits an improved PCE.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite possesses an ideal optical bandgap and is a potential material for fabricating the most efficient single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Nevertheless, large formamidinium (FA) cations result in residual lattice strain, which reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability of PSCs. Herein, the modulation of lattice strain in FAPbI3 crystals via a &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic amine, i.e., 4&#8208;pyrene oxy butylamine (PYBA), is proposed. PYBA pairs at the grain boundary serve as a template for the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskite, thereby inducing a highly oriented crystal and a pure &#945;&#8208;phase film. The PYBA pairs with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions provide a solid fulcrum for external compression strain, thus compensating for the inherent tension strain of FAPbI3 crystals. The strain release elevates the valence band of the perovskite crystals, thereby decreasing the bandgap and trap density. Consequently, the PYBA&#8208;regulated FAPbI3 PSC achieves an excellent PCE of 24.76%. Moreover, the resulting device exhibits improves operational stability and maintains over 80% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under maximum power point tracking conditions.

Solvent&#8208;free and skin&#8208;like supramolecular ion&#8208;conductive elastomers with high stability and excellent biocompatibility are reported, which can be simply processed into scalable and customized ionic&#8208;tattoos (I&#8208;tattoos) by painting and printing methods. The I&#8208;tattoos can work as ultraconformal on&#8208;skin electrodes for long&#8208;term and high&#8208;fidelity acquisition of various electrophysiological signals with extraordinary immunity to motion artifacts, enabling human&#8211;machine interactions and multichannel digital diagnosis.








Abstract
The development of stable and biocompatible soft ionic conductors, alternatives to hydrogels and ionogels, will open up new avenues for the construction of stretchable electronics. Here, a brand&#8208;new design, encapsulating a naturally occurring ionizable compound by a biocompatible polymer via high&#8208;density hydrogen bonds, resulting in a solvent&#8208;free supramolecular ion&#8208;conductive elastomer (SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE) that eliminates the dehydration problem of hydrogels and possesses excellent biocompatibility, is reported. The SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE with high ionic conductivity (&gt;3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1) exhibits skin&#8208;like softness and strain&#8208;stiffening behaviors, excellent elasticity, breathability, and self&#8208;adhesiveness. Importantly, the SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE can be obtained by a simple water evaporation step to solidify the aqueous precursor into a solvent&#8208;free nature. Therefore, the aqueous precursor can act as inks to be painted and printed into customized ionic tattoos (I&#8208;tattoos) for the construction of multifunctional on&#8208;skin bioelectronics. The painted I&#8208;tattoos exhibit ultraconformal and seamless contact with human skin, enabling long&#8208;term and high&#8208;fidelity recording of various electrophysiological signals with extraordinary immunity to motion artifacts. Human&#8211;machine interactions are achieved by exploiting the painted I&#8208;tattoos to transmit the electrophysiological signals of human beings. Stretchable I&#8208;tattoo electrode arrays, manufactured by the printing method, are demonstrated for multichannel digital diagnosis of the health condition of human back muscles and spine.

         <title>Calcitic Prisms of The Giant Seashell Pinna Nobilis Form Light Guide Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The calcitic prisms in Pinna nobilis shells act as optical fiber arrays guiding ambient light with high resolution into the inner shell cavity by total internal reflection. This is attributed to the high refractive index of calcite along the optical axis of the prisms and the coverage of their interfaces by low refractive index organic sheaths.








Abstract
The shells of the Pinnidae family are based on a double layer of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;like calcitic prisms and inner aragonitic nacre, a structure known for its outstanding mechanical performance. However, on the posterior side, shells are missing the nacreous layer, which raises the question of whether there can&#160;be any functional role in giving up this mechanical performance. Here, it is&#160;demonstrated that the prismatic part of the Pinna nobilis shell exhibits unusual optical properties, whereby each prism acts as an individual optical fiber guiding the ambient light to the inner shell cavity by total internal reflection. This pixelated light channeling enhances both spatial resolution and contrast while reducing angular blurring, an apt combination for acute tracking of a moving object. These&#160;findings offer insights into the evolutionary aspects of light&#8208;sensing and imaging and demonstrate how an architectured optical system for efficient light&#8208;tracking can be based on birefringent ceramics.

         <title>Correlating the Valence State with the Adsorption Behavior of a Cu&#8208;Based Electrocatalyst for Furfural Oxidation with Anodic Hydrogen Production Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;side H2 production device with ultralow energy input is built up, and the energy input is only 1/17 of water splitting. The deactivation mechanism of the anodic hydrogen production reaction is revealed as the changed adsorption ability of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This study provides guidelines for the design of a stable Cu&#8208;based catalyst in anodic hydrogen production reactions.








Abstract
The low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation reaction (FFOR) on a Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst can produce H2 at the anode, thereby providing a bipolar H2 production system with an ultralow cell voltage. However, the intrinsic activity and stability of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst for the FFOR remain unsatisfactory for practical applications. This study investigates the correlation between the valence state and the adsorption behavior of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst in furfural oxidation. Cu0 is the adsorption site with low intrinsic activity. Cu+, which exists in the form of Cu(OH)ads in alkaline electrolytes, has no adsorption ability but can improve the performance of Cu0 by promoting the adsorption of FF. Moreover, a mixed&#8208;valence Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst (MV Cu) with high intrinsic activity and stability is prepared electrochemically. With the MV Cu catalyst, the assembled dual&#8208;side H2 production electrolyzer has a low electricity requirement of only 0.24&#160;kWh&#160;mH2&#8722;3 at an ultralow cell voltage of 0.3&#160;V, and it exhibits sufficient stability. This study not only correlates the valence state with the adsorption behavior of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst for the low&#8208;potential FFOR with anodic H2 production but also reveals the mechanism of deactivation to provide design principles for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts with satisfactory stability.

This study not only correlates the valence state with the adsorption behavior of the Cu-based electrocatalyst for the low-potential FFOR with anodic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production but also reveals the mechanism of deactivation to provide design principles for Cu-based electrocatalysts with satisfactory stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming Charge Confinement in Perovskite Nanocrystal Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A re&#8208;assembling process is developed to overcome the charge confinement in perovskite nanocrystalline films (PeNCs) made of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals, by increasing the crystallite size and removing the long&#8208;chain ligands. Use of this strategy in gradient&#8208;bandgap PeNC solar cells achieves a high Jsc of 19.30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a power conversion efficiency of 16.46%.








Abstract
The small nanoparticle size and long&#8208;chain ligands in colloidal metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) cause charge confinement, which impedes exciton dissociation and carrier extraction in PeQD solar cells, so they have low short&#8208;circuit current density Jsc, which impedes further increases in their power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, a re&#8208;assembling process (RP) is developed for perovskite nanocrystalline (PeNC) films made of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals to increase Jsc in PeNC solar cells. The RP of PeNC films increases their crystallite size and eliminates long&#8208;chain ligands, and thereby overcomes the charge confinement in PeNC films. These changes facilitate exciton dissociation and increase carrier extraction in PeNC solar cells. By use of this method, the gradient&#8208;bandgap PeNC solar cells achieve a Jsc = 19.30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising the photovoltage, and yield a high PCE of 16.46% with negligible hysteresis and good stability. This work provides a new strategy to process PeNC films and pave the way for high performance PeNC optoelectronic devices.

         <title>The Oxygen Evolution Reaction Drives Passivity Breakdown for Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo&#160;Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivity breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys upon anodic polarization is traditionally believed to be caused by oxidation of stable Cr3+ oxide to soluble Cr6+ species leading to fast metal dissolution. By using multimodal in situ synchrotron measurements of highly alloyed Ni&#8211;base alloys, a new passivity breakdown mechanism is reported, namely oxygen evolution reaction (OER) induced metal dissolution occurring at lower anodic potentials.








Abstract
Corrosion is the main factor limiting the lifetime of metallic materials, and a fundamental understanding of the governing mechanism and surface processes is difficult to achieve since the thin oxide films at the metal&#8211;liquid interface governing passivity are notoriously challenging to study. In this work, a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based techniques and electrochemical methods is used to investigate the passive film breakdown of a Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo alloy, which is&#160;used in many industrial applications. This alloy is found to be active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the OER onset coincides with the loss of passivity and severe metal dissolution. The OER mechanism involves the oxidation of Mo4+ sites in the oxide film to Mo6+ that can be dissolved, which results in passivity breakdown. This is fundamentally different from typical transpassive breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys where Cr6+ is postulated to be dissolved at high anodic potentials, which is not observed here. At high current densities, OER also leads to acidification of the solution near the surface, further triggering metal dissolution. The OER plays an important role in the mechanism of passivity breakdown of Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo alloys due to their catalytic activity, and this effect needs to be considered when studying the corrosion of catalytically active alloys.

         <title>Bilayer Zwitterionic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Superionic Conduction in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte featuring bilayer zwitterionic nanochannels (BZN) is constructed by grafting soft multicationic oligomers (MCOs) onto a rigid anionic MOF framework. The unique BZN can serve as ion&#8208;selectivity gates, specifically promoting the transport of Li+ and rendering stable operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state full cells.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) hold immense potential for improved energy density and safety compared to traditional batteries. However, existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) face challenges in meeting the complex operational requirements of SSBs. This study&#160;introduces a novel approach to address this issue by developing a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with customized bilayer zwitterionic nanochannels (MOF&#8208;BZN) as high&#8208;performance SSEs. The BZN consist of a rigid anionic MOF channel with chemically grafted soft multicationic oligomers (MCOs) on the pore wall. This design enables selective superionic conduction, with MCOs restricting the movement of anions while coulombic interaction between MCOs and anionic framework promoting the dissociation of Li+. MOF&#8208;BZN exhibits remarkable Li+ conductivity (8.76 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1), high Li+ transference number (0.75), and a wide electrochemical window of up to 4.9&#160;V at 30 &#176;C. Ultimately, the SSB utilizing flame retarded MOF&#8208;BZN achieves an impressive specific energy of 419.6&#160;Wh kganode+cathode+electrolyte&#8722;1 under constrained conditions of high cathode loading (20.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and limited lithium metal source. The constructed bilayer zwitterionic MOFs present a pioneering strategy for developing advanced SSEs for highly efficient SSBs.

         <title>Patterning Complex Line Motifs in Thin Films Using Immersion&#8208;Controlled Reaction&#8208;Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, reaction&#8208;diffusion driven immersion&#8208;controlled patterning (R&#8208;DIP) is introduced. By tying reaction&#8208;diffusion processes to immersion, wafer&#8208;scale line motifs are created. In R&#8208;DIP, a balance between diffusion and immersion speed provides robustness toward defects and highly uniform line spacing. The functionality potential of R&#8208;DIP is demonstrated by manufacturing tunable optical diffraction gratings and an opto&#8208;mechanical sensor.








Abstract
The discovery of self&#8208;organization principles that enable scalable routes toward complex functional materials has proven to be a persistent challenge. Here, reaction&#8208;diffusion driven, immersion&#8208;controlled patterning (R&#8208;DIP) is introduced, a self&#8208;organization strategy using immersion&#8208;controlled reaction&#8208;diffusion for targeted line patterning in thin films. By modulating immersion speeds, the movement of a reaction&#8208;diffusion front over gel films is controlled, which induces precipitation of highly uniform lines at the reaction front. A balance between the immersion speed and diffusion provides both hands&#8208;on tunability of the line spacing (d=10&#8722;300&#956;m$d = 10-300 \; \umu \text{m}$) as well as error&#8208;correction against defects. This immersion&#8208;driven patterning strategy is widely applicable, which is demonstrated by producing line patterns of silver/silver oxide nanoparticles, silver chromate, silver dichromate, and lead carbonate. Through combinatorial stacking of different line patterns, hybrid materials with multi&#8208;dimensional patterns such as square&#8208;, diamond&#8208;, rectangle&#8208;, and triangle&#8208;shaped motifs are fabricated. The functionality potential and scalability is demonstrated by producing both wafer&#8208;scale diffraction gratings with user&#8208;defined features as well as an opto&#8208;mechanical sensor based on Moir&#233;&#160;patterning.

         <title>Realizing Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting by Modulating the Thickness&#8208;Induced Reaction Energy Barrier of Fluorenone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrathin three&#8208;layer structure of fluorenone&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is successfully constructed to realize photocatalytic overall water splitting. Reducing the thickness of the COF nanosheets is found to increase&#160;the number of&#160;accessible active sites, reduce the distance for charge migration distance, prolong the lifetimes of photogenerated carriers, and decrease the Gibbs free energy of rate&#8208;limiting step for oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Direct photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution from water splitting is an attractive approach for producing chemical fuels. In this work, a novel fluorenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2) is successfully exfoliated into ultrathin three&#8208;layer nanosheets (UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2) for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) under visible light. The ultrathin structures of UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 greatly enhance carrier separation, utilization efficiency, and the exposure of active surface sites. Surprisingly, UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 exhibits efficient photocatalytic OWS performance, with hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates reaching 0.046 and 0.021 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively,&#160;under visible&#8208;light irradiation, whereas bulk COF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 shows no activity for photocatalytic OWS. Charge&#8208;carrier kinetic analysis and DFT calculations confirm that reducing the thickness of the COF nanosheets increases&#160;the number of&#160;accessible active sites, reduces the distance for charge migration, prolongs the lifetimes of photogenerated carriers, and decreases the Gibbs free energy of the rate&#8208;limiting step compared to nonexfoliated COFs. This work offers new insights into the effect of the layer thickness of COFs on photocatalytic OWS.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Electron Delocalization Realized by Axial Fe4C Atomic Clusters Delivers High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new deeper viewpoint for how to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts is shown in this work. Axial Fe4C atomic clusters can provide strong electronic perturbation to Fe&#8211;N4 active centers, leading to the d&#8208;orbital electron delocalization of Fe and forming the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 bond with high charge distribution compared with Fe and Fe3C atomic clusters. Moreover, unlike the previous studies, this research focuses more on the electron distribution of Fe&#8211;N structure, rather than Fe electronic structures.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction&#160;(ORR) has been considered as the most promising nonprecious metal catalyst due to its comparable catalytic performance to Pt in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The active centers of Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 have been proven to be extremely active for ORR. However, forming a stable Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 structure is a huge challenge. Here, a Cyan&#8208;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 as the intrinsic active center is constructed with the help of axial Fe4C atomic clusters, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of up to 0.836&#160;V (vs. RHE) in the acid environment. More remarkably, it delivers a high power density of 870 and 478&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 1.0&#160;bar in H2&#8211;O2 and H2&#8211;Air fuel cells, respectively. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the axial Fe4C can provide strong electronic perturbation to Fe&#8211;N4 active centers, leading to the d&#8208;orbital electron delocalization of Fe and forming the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 bond with high charge distribution, which stabilizes the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 structure and optimizes the OH* adsorption during the catalytic process. This work proposes a new strategy to adjust the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts based on the strong interaction between single atoms and atomic clusters.

         <title>Coaxial Nanowire Electrodes Enable Exceptional Fuel Cell Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst/electrode architecture based on a vertically aligned array of ionomer nanowires encapsulated by Pt nanofilms is presented. The resulting coaxial nanowire electrode uses durable Pt nanofilms in place of conventional Pt/C catalysts. This design eliminates the corrosion&#8208;prone carbon supports and ionomer thin films, providing enhanced durability and performance.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) hold great promise for applications in clean energy conversion, but cost and durability continue to limit commercialization. This work presents a new class of catalyst/electrode architecture that does not rely on Pt particles or carbon supports, eliminating the primary degradation mechanisms in conventional electrodes, and thereby enabling transformative durability improvements. The coaxial nanowire electrode (CANE) architecture consists of an array of vertically aligned nanowires, each comprising an ionomer core encapsulated by a nanoscale Pt film. This unique design eliminates the triple&#8208;phase boundary and replaces it with two double&#8208;phase boundaries, increasing Pt utilization. It also eliminates the need for carbon support and ionomer binder, enabling improved durability and faster mass transport. Fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies based on CANEs demonstrate extraordinary durability in accelerated stress tests (ASTs), with only 2% and 5% loss in performance after 5000 support AST cycles and 30000 catalysts AST cycles, respectively. The high power density and extremely high durability provided by CANEs can enable a paradigm shift from random electrodes based on unstable platinum nanoparticles dispersed on carbon to ordered electrodes based on durable Pt nanofilms, facilitating rapid deployment of fuel cells in transportation and other clean energy applications.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Diffusion Management Enables All&#8208;Interface Defect Passivation of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;diffusion management strategy using dual passivating reagents of octylammonium iodide (OAI) and guanidinium chloride is demonstrated to realize all&#8208;interface passivation via one&#8208;step post&#8208;treatment, outperforming the traditional passivation with OAI. This strategy delivers a superior efficiency&#160;of 25.43% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.202&#160;V, representing 94.05% of the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit VOC for the 1.55&#8208;eV perovskite absorber.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated over 25% power conversion efficiency (PCE) via efficient surface passivation. Unfortunately, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite post&#8208;treatment strategies can solely heal the top interface defects. Herein, an ion&#8208;diffusion management strategy is proposed to concurrently modulate the top interfaces, buried interfaces, and bulk interfaces (i.e., grain boundaries) of perovskite film, enabling all&#8208;interface defect passivation. Specifically, this method is enabled by applying double interactive salts of octylammonium iodide (OAI) and guanidinium chloride (GACl) onto the 3D&#160;perovskite surface. It is revealed that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between OA+ and GA+ decelerates the OA+ diffusion and therefore forms a dimensionally broadened 2D capping layer. Additionally, the diffusion of GA+ and Cl&#8722; determines the composition of the bulk and buried interface of PSCs. As a result, n&#8211;inter&#8211;i&#8211;inter&#8211;p, i.e., five&#8208;layer structured PSCs can be obtained with a champion PCE of 25.43% (certified 24.4%). This approach also enables the substantially improved operational stability of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Interfacial &#8220;Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;in&#8208;Defects&#8221; Catalysts Accelerating Li+ Desolvation Kinetics for Long&#8208;Lifespan Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The desolvation of Li+&#8208;solvents complex and Li0 diffusion kinetics are investigated experimentally and theoretically by applying atomic iron&#8208;in&#8208;defects (SAC&#8208;in&#8208;Defects) as the catalytic kinetics promotor, significantly reducing the related energy barriers of desolvation and diffusion. Consequently, the half and full cells stabilize long lifespans with high utilizations.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;metal anode is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high capacity and low potential. However, several rate&#8208;limiting kinetic obstacles, such as the desolvation of Li+ solvation structure to liberate Li+, Li0 nucleation, and atom diffusion, cause heterogeneous spatial Li&#8208;ion distribution and fractal plating morphology with dendrite formation, leading to low Coulombic efficiency and depressive electrochemical stability. Herein, differing from pore sieving effect or electrolyte engineering, atomic iron anchors to cation vacancy&#8208;rich Co1&#8722;xS embedded in 3D porous carbon (SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC) is&#160;proposed and demonstrated as catalytic kinetic promoters. Numerous free Li ions are electrocatalytically dissociated from the Li+ solvation complex structure for uniform lateral diffusion by reducing desolvation and diffusion barriers via SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC, realizing smooth dendrite&#8208;free Li morphologies, as comprehensively understood by combined in&#160;situ/ex&#160;situ characterizations. Encouraged by SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC catalytic promotor, the modified Li&#8208;metal anodes achieve smooth plating with a long lifespan (1600&#160;h) and high Coulombic efficiency without any dendrite formation. Paired with the LiFePO4 cathode, the full cell (10.7&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) stabilizes a capacity retention of 90.3% after 300 cycles at 0.5&#160;C, signifying the feasibility of using interfacial catalysts for modulating Li behaviors toward practical applications.

Two acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor type organic emitters named NTQ and BTQ with narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13 eV are employed as short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) applications. The resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ show good SWIR radiation properties, with a maximal radiant exitance of 1.12 mW cm&#8208;2 at 1140 nm, one of the highest values for OLEDs emitting at SWIR region.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, infrared lighting, optical communication, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. Due to an intrinsic limitation posed by the energy&#8208;gap law, achieving high&#8208;brightness in SWIR OLEDs remains a challenge. Herein, the study reports the use of novel A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules NTQ and BTQ for high&#8208;performance SWIR OLEDs. Benefiting from multiple D&#8211;A effect in conjugated skeleton, the small molecules NTQ and BTQ exhibit narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13&#160;eV, respectively. SWIR electroluminescence (EL) emission from OLEDs based on NTQ and BTQ is achieved, with emission peaks at 1140 and 1175&#160;nm, respectively. Not only owing to a negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off across the full range of applied current density but also the ability to afford a high operation current density of 5200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ exhibit a maximal radiant exitance of =1.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the NTQ&#8208;based OLEDs also possess sub&#8208;gap turn&#8208;on voltage of 0.85&#160;V, which is close to the physical limits derived from the generalized Kirchhoff and Planck equation. This work demonstrates that A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules offer significant promise for NIR/SWIR emitting material innovations.

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Spectral And Directional Emissivity with Gradient Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero InAs Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally generated light is ubiquitous and its control is critical to a broad range of energy and sensing technologies. Semiconductor photonic films with tailored spatial doping gradients are demonstrated to deliver simultaneous control of both directional and spectral aspects of their thermal emission due to the spatial gradient in the epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero frequency they support.








Abstract
Controlling both the spectral bandwidth and directionality of emitted thermal radiation is a fundamental challenge in contemporary photonics. Recent work has shown that materials with a spatial gradient in the frequency range of their epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) response can support broad spectrum directionality in their emissivity, enabling high total radiance to specific angles of incidence. However, this capability is limited spectrally and directionally by the availability of materials with phonon&#8208;polariton resonances over long&#8208;wave infrared wavelengths. Here, an approach is designed and experimentally demonstrated using doped III&#8211;V semiconductors that can simultaneously tailor spectral peak, bandwidth, and directionality of infrared emissivity. InAs&#8208;based gradient ENZ photonic structures that exhibit broadband directional emission with varying spectral bandwidths and directional ranges as a function of their doping concentration profile and thickness are epitaxially grown and characterized. Due to its easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate geometry, it is believed that this approach provides a versatile photonic platform to dynamically control broadband spectral and directional emissivity for a range of emerging applications in heat transfer and infrared sensing.

However, this capability is limited spectrally and directionally by the availability of materials with phonon-polariton resonances over long-wave infrared wavelengths. Here, an approach is designed and experimentally demonstrated using doped III&#8211;V semiconductors that can simultaneously tailor spectral peak, bandwidth, and directionality of infrared emissivity. InAs-based gradient ENZ photonic structures that exhibit broadband directional emission with varying spectral bandwidths and directional ranges as a function of their doping concentration profile and thickness are epitaxially grown and characterized. Due to its easy-to-fabricate geometry, it is believed that this approach provides a versatile photonic platform to dynamically control broadband spectral and directional emissivity for a range of emerging applications in heat transfer and infrared sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MoS2@Polyaniline for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NH4+ is made of extremely abundant elements and has a lower molar mass (18&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1) and a smaller hydrated radius (3.3&#160;&#197;) than most metal ions. These characteristics and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the metal oxide and NH4+ facilitate fast diffusion kinetics and reversible reaction. This work demonstrates the great potential of composite engineering in optimizing the performance of ammonium&#8208;ion insertion electrodes.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion aqueous supercapacitors are raising notable attention owing to their cost, safety, and environmental advantages, but the development of optimized electrode materials for ammonium&#8208;ion storage still lacks behind expectations. To overcome current challenges, here, a sulfide&#8208;based composite electrode based on MoS2 and polyaniline (MoS2@PANI) is proposed as an ammonium&#8208;ion host. The optimized composite possesses specific capacitances above 450&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and 86.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in a three&#8208;electrode configuration. PANI not only contributes to the electrochemical performance but also plays a key role in defining the final MoS2 architecture. Symmetric supercapacitors assembled with such electrodes display energy densities above 60&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 725&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1. Compared with Li+ and K+ ions, the surface capacitive contribution in NH4+&#8208;based devices is lower at every scan rate, which points to an effective generation/breaking of H&#8208;bonds as the mechanism controlling the rate of NH4+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion. This result is supported by density functional theory calculations, which also show that sulfur vacancies effectively enhance the NH4+ adsorption energy and improve the electrical conductivity of the whole composite. Overall, this work demonstrates the great potential of composite engineering in optimizing the performance of ammonium&#8208;ion insertion electrodes.

         <title>Biocatalytic Foams from Microdroplet&#8208;Formulated Self&#8208;Assembling Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytically active enzyme foams produced via microdroplet foaming of self&#8208;assembling enzymes exhibit a regular hexagonal honeycomb network, the mechanical stability of which increases by drying to achieve high biocatalytic performance in continuous flow processes.








Abstract
Industrial biocatalysis plays an important role in the development of a sustainable economy, as enzymes can be used to synthesize an enormous range of complex molecules under environmentally friendly conditions. To further develop the field, intensive research is being conducted on process technologies for continuous flow biocatalysis in order to immobilize large quantities of enzyme biocatalysts in microstructured flow reactors under conditions that are as gentle as possible in order to realize efficient material conversions. Here, monodisperse foams consisting almost entirely of enzymes covalently linked via SpyCatcher/SpyTag conjugation are reported. The biocatalytic foams are readily available from recombinant enzymes via microfluidic air&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet formation, can be directly integrated into microreactors, and can be used for biocatalytic conversions after drying. Reactors prepared by this method show surprisingly high stability and biocatalytic activity. The physicochemical characterization of the new materials is described and exemplary applications in biocatalysis are shown using two&#8208;enzyme cascades for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral alcohols and the rare sugar tagatose.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Copper&#8211;Iron Atomic Pair as Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites for Boosting Electrocatalytic NO Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) removal is urgent due to the artificially induced N&#8208;cycle unbalance, atomic copper&#8211;iron bimetallic catalyst bridged by an axial oxygen atom is demonstrated as the electrocatalyst for NO electroreduction. It exhibits a high NH3 yield of 112.52&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of 90%. NO removal, NH3 synthesis, and power output in Zn&#8211;NO battery can be achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) is a promising approach to NH3 synthesis. However, due to the lack of efficient electrocatalysts, the performance of electrocatalytic NO reduction reaction (NORR) is far from satisfactory. Herein, it is reported that an atomic copper&#8211;iron dual&#8208;site electrocatalyst bridged by an axial oxygen atom (O&#63743;Fe&#63743;N6&#63743;Cu) is anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CuFe DS/NC) for NORR. The CuFe DS/NC can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis performance (Faraday efficiency, 90%; yield rate, 112.52&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) at &#8722;0.6&#160;V versus RHE, which is dramatically higher than the corresponding Cu single&#8208;atom, Fe single&#8208;atom and all NORR single&#8208;atom catalysts in the literature so far. Moreover, an assembled proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Zn&#8211;NO battery using CuFe DS/NC as the cathode outputs a power density of 2.30&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 45.52&#160;&#181;g&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1. The theoretical calculation result indicates that bimetallic sites can promote electrocatalytic NORR by changing the rate&#8208;determining step and accelerating the protonation process. This work provides a flexible strategy for efficient sustainable NH3 synthesis.

Solid&#8211;Liquid Phase Transitions
In article number 2300542, Franklin Liou, Hsin&#8208;Zon Tsai, Alex Zettl, Johannes Lischner, Michael Crommie, and co&#8208;workers use scanning tunneling microscopy to image a solid&#8211;liquid phase transition with sub&#8208;nanometer spatial resolution at the surface of a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor. They use electrostatic gating to drive reversible transitions between a quasi&#8208;1D molecular solid and a 2D ionic liquid phase. Transiently heating and cooling the device enables non&#8208;equilibrium melting dynamics to be visualized.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
In article number 2302924, Lianjie Zhang, Junwu Chen, Hongbin Wu, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the challenges associated with low quantum efficiency or radiance of ordinary organic emitters in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared region can be addressed by the rational design of an organic emitter with an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor structure. The resultant organic light&#8208;emitting diodes have electroluminescence peak above 1100nm, with one of the highest radiant emittances reported to date.

An efficient, precise, and scalable 4D additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing paradigm for ceramics with multimode shape&#8208;memory capabilities is developed by Jian Lu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2302108. The balance between thermal expansion and shrinkage is the mechanism for the ceramic 4D printing. A high flame&#8208;ablation performance of complex&#8208;shaped ceramics is achieved with Al2O3&#8208;deposited SiOC&#8208;based nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous dual&#8208;phase ceramic lattice structures.

         <title>Short Peptide Nanofiber Biomaterials Ameliorate Local Hemostatic Capacity of Surgical Materials and Intraoperative Hemostatic Applications in Clinics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short peptide nanofiber biomaterials are an intriguing surgical tool to serve as functional hemostatic devices and have claimed more and more advantages over traditional biomaterials and formulations. The comparable aspects in surgical applications, hemostatic mechnism, and emerging medical devices are addressed comprehensively in multiple surgical specialties.








Abstract
Short designer self&#8208;assembling peptide (dSAP) biomaterials are a new addition to the hemostat group. It may provide a diverse and robust toolbox for surgeons to integrate wound microenvironment with much safer and stronger hemostatic capacity than conventional materials and hemostatic agents. Especially in noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH), diffuse mucosal surface bleeding, and internal medical bleeding (IMB), with respect to the optimal hemostatic formulation, dSAP biomaterials are the ingenious nanofiber alternatives to make bioactive neural scaffold, nasal packing, large mucosal surface coverage in gastrointestinal surgery (esophagus, gastric lesion, duodenum, and lower digestive tract), epicardiac cell&#8208;delivery carrier, transparent matrix barrier, and so on. Herein, in multiple surgical specialties, dSAP&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based nano&#8208;hemostats achieve safe, effective, and immediate hemostasis, facile wound healing, and potentially reduce the risks in delayed bleeding, rebleeding, post&#8208;operative bleeding, or related complications. The biosafety in vivo, bleeding indications, tissue&#8208;sealing quality, surgical feasibility, and local usability are addressed comprehensively and sequentially and pursued to develop useful surgical techniques with better hemostatic performance. Here, the state of the art and all&#8208;round advancements of nano&#8208;hemostatic approaches in surgery are provided. Relevant critical insights will inspire exciting investigations on peptide nanotechnology, next&#8208;generation biomaterials, and better promising prospects in clinics.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Strain Engineering for Heterogenous Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;strain engineering as an innovative strategy for fine tuning the surface electronic configuration of nanomaterials provides a guideline for the development of heterogenous oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The energy efficiency of metal&#8211;air batteries and water&#8208;splitting techniques is severely constrained by multiple electronic transfers in the heterogenous oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the high overpotential induced by the sluggish kinetics has become an uppermost scientific challenge. Numerous attempts are devoted to enabling high activity, selectivity, and stability via tailoring the surface physicochemical properties of nanocatalysts. Lattice&#8208;strain engineering as a cutting&#8208;edge method for tuning the electronic and geometric configuration of metal sites plays a pivotal role in regulating the interaction of catalytic surfaces with adsorbate molecules. By defining the d&#8208;band center as a descriptor of the structure&#8211;activity relationship, the individual contribution of strain effects within state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts can be systematically elucidated in the OER optimization mechanism. In this review, the fundamentals of the OER and the advancements of strain&#8208;catalysts are showcased&#160;and the innovative trigger strategies are enumerated, with particular emphasis on the feedback mechanism between the precise regulation of lattice&#8208;strain and optimal activity. Subsequently, the modulation of electrocatalysts with various attributes is categorized and the impediments encountered in the practicalization of strained effect are discussed, ending with an outlook on future research directions for this burgeoning field.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Based Therapies for Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 39, September 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of inflammatory therapy based on transition metal&#8208;based smart nanosystems from the aspects of rationale design strategies (types, nanozyme activity regulation, physical and chemical characteristics) and therapeutic mechanisms (scavenge, block, and delivery&#8208;based strategy) is provided in this review with an emphasis on the current challenges and prospects in this field.








Abstract
Inflammatory disease (ID) is a general term that covers all diseases in which chronic inflammation performs as the major manifestation of pathogenesis. Traditional therapies based on the anti&#8208;inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs are palliative with the short&#8208;term remission. The emergence of nanodrugs has been reported to solve the potential causes and prevent recurrences, thus holding great potential for the treatment of IDs. Among various nanomaterial systems, transition metal&#8208;based smart nanosystems (TMSNs) with unique electronic structures possess therapeutic advantages owing to their large surface area to volume ratio, high photothermal conversion efficiency, X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, and multiple catalytic enzyme activities. In this review, the rationale, design principle, and therapeutic mechanisms of TMSNs for treatments of various IDs are summarized. Specifically, TMSNs can not only be designed to scavenge danger signals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and cell&#8208;free DNA, but also can be engineered to block the mechanism of initiating inflammatory responses. In addition, TMSNs can be further applied as nanocarriers to deliver anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of TMSNs are discussed, and the future directions of TMSN&#8208;based ID treatment for clinical applications are emphasized.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging neuromorphic sensory computing by iontronic devices, highlighting representative concepts of both low&#8208;level and high&#8208;level sensory computing and introducing important material and device breakthroughs.








Abstract
Living organisms have a very mysterious and powerful sensory computing system based on ion activity. Interestingly, studies&#160;on iontronic devices in the past few years have proposed a promising platform for simulating the sensing and computing functions of living organisms, because: 1) iontronic devices can generate, store, and transmit a variety of signals by adjusting the concentration and spatiotemporal distribution of ions, which analogs to how the brain performs intelligent functions by alternating ion flux and polarization; 2) through ionic&#8208;electronic coupling, iontronic devices can bridge the biosystem with electronics and offer profound implications for soft electronics; 3) with the diversity of ions, iontronic devices can be designed to recognize specific ions or molecules by customizing the charge selectivity, and the ionic conductivity and capacitance can be adjusted to respond to external stimuli for a variety of sensing schemes, which can be more difficult for electron&#8208;based devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging neuromorphic sensory computing by iontronic devices, highlighting representative concepts of both low&#8208;level and high&#8208;level sensory computing and introducing important material and device breakthroughs. Moreover, iontronic devices as a means of neuromorphic sensing and computing are discussed regarding the pending challenges and future directions.

Polyimides (PIs) are widely used in circuit components, electrical insulators, and power systems in modern electronic devices and large electrical appliances. Electrical/mechanical damage of materials are important factors that threaten reliability and service lifetime. Dynamic (self&#8208;healable, recyclable and degradable) PIs, a promising class of materials that successfully improve electrical/mechanical properties after damage, are anticipated to solve this issue. The viewpoints and perspectives on the status and future trends of dynamic PI based on a few existing documents are shared. The main damage forms of PI dielectric materials in the application process are first introduced, and initial strategies and schemes to solve these problems are proposed. Fundamentally, the bottleneck issues faced by the development of dynamic PIs are indicated, and the relationship between various damage forms and the universality of the method is evaluated. The potential mechanism of the dynamic PI to deal with electrical damage is highlighted and several feasible prospective schemes to address electrical damage are discussed. This study is concluded by presenting a short outlook and future improvements to systems, challenges, and solutions of dynamic PI in electrical insulation. The summary of theory and practice should encourage policy development favoring energy conservation and environmental protection and promoting sustainability.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Reactions on Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>

Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions play a critical role in the synthesis of value&#8208;added products within the chemical industry. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) using water as the hydrogen source has emerged as an alternative to conventional thermocatalytic processes for sustainable and decentralized chemical synthesis under mild conditions. Among various ECH catalysts, copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) nanomaterials are promising candidates due to their earth&#8208;abundance, unique electronic structure, versatility, and high activity/selectivity. Herein, recent advances in the application of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH reactions for the upgrading of valuable chemicals are systematically analyzed. The unique properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH are initially introduced, followed by the design strategies to enhance their activity and selectivity. Then, typical ECH reactions on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are presented in detail, including carbon dioxide reduction for multicarbon generation, alkyne&#8208;to&#8208;alkene conversion, selective aldehyde conversion, ammonia production from nitrogen&#8208;containing substances, and amine production from organic nitrogen compounds. In these catalysts, we focus on the role of catalyst composition and nanostructures toward different products. The co&#8208;hydrogenation of two substrates (e.g., CO2 and NOxn, CO2 and SO32&#8211;, etc.) via C&#8211;N, C&#8211;S, and C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions are also highlighted. Finally, the critical issues and future perspectives of Cu&#8208;catalyzed ECH are proposed to accelerate the rational development of next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <title>Fast Gas&#8208;Adsorption Kinetics in Supraparticle&#8208;Based MOF Packings with Hierarchical Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#160;adsorbents with a multilevel hierarchical pore structure consisting of interconnected pore networks at three distinct length scales (&gt;1000, &#8776;100, and &#8776;1 nm) exhibit efficient mass transport. These materials can be self&#8208;assembled using supraparticles formed with nanoscale ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles as intermediate building blocks and exhibit 30 times faster adsorption kinetics compared to their unstructured analogs.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high&#8208;throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this work, this problem is addressed by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle&#8208;based approach. Spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles are fabricated by emulsion templating and they are used as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) particles are used as a model system and the gas&#8208;adsorption kinetics of the hierarchical material are compared with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. It is demonstrated that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate compared to an unstructured ZIF&#8208;8 powder pellet. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials. In the hierarchical MOFs, large macropores between the supraparticles, smaller macropores between individual ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles, and micropores inherent to the ZIF&#8208;8 framework collude to combine large surface area, defined adsorption sites, and efficient mass transport to enhance performance.

         <title>Scaling&#8208;Up Insights for Zinc&#8211;Air Battery Technologies Realizing Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Scalable insights of zinc batteries for designing robust Zn&#8208;metal anodes with compatible preferred orientations are presented. Half&#8208; and full&#8208;cells performances are evaluated with commercial standards to compete with lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) technology is considered one of the promising candidates to complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries for future large&#8208;scale high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage demands. The scientific literature reveals many efforts for the ZAB chemistries, materials design, and limited accounts for cell design principles with apparently superior performances for liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. However, along with the difficulty of forming robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases, the discrepancy in testing methods and assessment metrics severely challenges the realistic evaluation/comparison and commercialization of ZABs. Here, strategies to formulate reversible zinc anodes are proposed and specific cell&#8208;level energy metrics (100&#8722;500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and realistic long&#8208;cycling operations are realized. Stabilizing anode/electrolyte interfaces results in a cumulative capacity of 25 Ah cm&#8722;2 and Coulomb efficiency of &gt;99.9% for 5000 plating/stripping cycles. Using 1&#8211;10 Ah scale (&#8776;500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at cell level) solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air pouch cells, scale&#8208;up insights for Ah&#8208;level ZABs that can progress from lab&#8208;scale research to practical production are also offered.

         <title>Perspectives on the Novel Multifunctional Nerve Guidance conduits: From Specific Regenerative Procedures to Motor Function Rebuilding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury potentially destroys the quality of life by inducing functional movement disorders and sensory capacity loss, which results in severe disability and substantial psychological, social, and financial burdens. Autologous nerve grafting has been commonly used as treatment in the clinic; however, its rare donor availability limits its application. A series of artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGC) with advanced architectures have also been proposed to promote injured peripheral nerve regeneration, which is a complicated process from axon sprouting to targeted muscle reinnervation. Therefore, exploring the interactions between sophisticated NGC complexes and versatile cells during each process including axon sprouting, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, nerve myelination, and muscle reinnervation is necessary. This review highlights the contribution of functional NGCs and the influence of microscale biomaterial architecture on biological processes of nerve repair. Progressive NGCs with chemical molecule induction, heterogeneous topographical morphology, electroactive, anisotropic assembly microstructure, and self&#8208;powered electroactive and magnetic&#8208;sensitive NGCs were also collected, and they are expected to be pioneering features in future multifunctional and effective NGCs.

         <title>Ultralow Roll&#8208;Off Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Using Engineered Carrier Injection Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLED) have attracted extensive attention due to their high color purity, solution&#8208;processability, and high brightness. Due to extensive efforts, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of QLED has approached the theoretical limit. However, because of the efficiency roll&#8208;off, the high EQE can only be achieved at relatively low luminance, hindering their application in high&#8208;brightness devices such as near&#8208;to&#8208;eye displays and lighting applications. Here, we report an ultralow roll&#8208;off QLEDs that is achieved by simultaneously blocking electron leakage and enhancing the hole injection, thereby shifting the recombination zone back to the emitting quantum dots (QDs) layer. These devices maintain EQE over 20.6% up to 1000 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 current density, dropping only by &#8764;5% from the peak EQE of 21.6%, which is the highest value ever reported for the bottom&#8208;emitting red QLEDs. Furthermore, the maximum luminance of the optimal device reached 320,000 cd&#183;m&#8722;2, 2.7 times higher than the control device (Lmax: 128,000 cd&#183;m&#8722;2). We also demonstrated a passive matrix QLED display panel with high brightness based on the optimized device structure. The proposed approach advances the potential of QLEDs to operate efficiently in high&#8208;brightness scenarios.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLED) have attracted extensive attention due to their high color purity, solution-processability, and high brightness. Due to extensive efforts, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of QLED has approached the theoretical limit. However, because of the efficiency roll-off, the high EQE can only be achieved at relatively low luminance, hindering their application in high-brightness devices such as near-to-eye displays and lighting applications. Here, we report an ultralow roll-off QLEDs that is achieved by simultaneously blocking electron leakage and enhancing the hole injection, thereby shifting the recombination zone back to the emitting quantum dots (QDs) layer. These devices maintain EQE over 20.6% up to 1000 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density, dropping only by &#8764;5% from the peak EQE of 21.6%, which is the highest value ever reported for the bottom-emitting red QLEDs. Furthermore, the maximum luminance of the optimal device reached 320,000 cd&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.7 times higher than the control device (L&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;: 128,000 cd&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). We also demonstrated a passive matrix QLED display panel with high brightness based on the optimized device structure. The proposed approach advances the potential of QLEDs to operate efficiently in high-brightness scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Like Nanozymes: Regulation, Rational Design, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multienzymic nanozymes are nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity. Multienzymic nanozymes have unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and responsive selectivity. The catalytic mechanism of multienzymic nanozymes is more complicated and elusive than single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the classification, regulating factors, rational design, and application of multienzymic nanozymes are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity are termed multienzymic nanozymes, and they&#160;have received increasing attention in recent years and hold huge potential to be applied in diverse fields, especially for biosensing and therapeutics. Compared to single enzyme&#8208;like nanozymes, multienzymic nanozymes offer various unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and environmentally responsive selectivity. Nevertheless, along with these merits, the catalytic mechanism and rational design of multienzymic nanozymes are more complicated and elusive as compared to single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the multienzymic nanozymes classification scheme based on the numbers/types of activities, the internal and external factors regulating the multienzymatic activities, the rational design based on chemical, biomimetic, and computer&#8208;aided strategies, and recent progress in applications attributed to the advantages of multicatalytic activities are systematically discussed. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development and application of multienzymatic nanozymes are suggested. This review aims to deepen the understanding and inspire the research in multienzymic nanozymes to a greater extent.

         <title>Activating Selenium Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se (abbreviated as &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se) is successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal method for advanced cathodes of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs). Benefiting from synergistic doping and amorphization strategy, the resulting &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se||Zn battery displays record&#8208;high capacity and exceptional cyclability. Such novel electrode chemistry of &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se with both intercalation/deintercalation and deposition/stripping mechanisms opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation ARZIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs) are a promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage device by virtue of the superior safety and low cost of both the aqueous electrolyte and zinc&#8208;metal anode. However, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can provide both lightweight and compact size. Herein, a novel cathode chemistry based on amorphous Se doped with transition metal Ru that mitigates the resistive surface layer produced by the side reactions between the Se cathode and aqueous electrolyte is reported. This improvement can permit high volumetric capacity in this system. Distinct from the conventional conversion mechanisms between Se and ZnSe in Se||Zn cells, this strategy realizes synchronous proton and Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation in the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells. Moreover, an unanticipated Zn2+ deposition/stripping process in this system further contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of this new cathode chemistry. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells are found to deliver a record&#8208;high capacity of 721&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1/3472&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, and superior cycling stability of over 800 cycles with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle. This reported work opens the door for new chemistries that can further improve the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of ARZIBs.

         <title>A Cholesterol Metabolic Regulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;Based Biotuner for Antibody Non&#8208;Dependent Immunotherapy Tailored for Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanocarrier, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based biotuner, regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism for bidirectionally blocking immune checkpoints to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive microenvironment. It synergizes with chemiexcited&#8208;PDT to enable effective immunotherapy and significantly inhibit glioblastoma growth. The biotuner is tailored to address the immunotherapeutic dilemma and metabolic characteristics of glioblastomas, providing new insights into the metabolically regulated immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastomas.








Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma (GBM) poses a tremendous obstacle to effective immunotherapy due to its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) specifically designed for GBM immunotherapy is developed, taking advantage of the relatively isolated cholesterol metabolism microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS). The HOF&#8208;based biotuner regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism, effectively blocking the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) pathway and reducing 2B4 expression. This metabolically disrupts the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM and rejuvenates CD8+ T cells. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism regulation offers additional benefits in treating GBM invasion. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;initiated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT) is enhanced during the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and the biotuner can effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in GBM. By reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and bolstering chemiexcited&#8208;PDT, this approach invigorates efficient antibody non&#8208;dependent immunotherapy for GBM. This study provides a model for enhancing immunotherapy through cholesterol metabolism regulation and explores the feasibility of a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; strategy in GBM treatment.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Discovery of Amorphous Fluorinated Polymer Electret with Improved Charge Stability for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new descriptor, solid&#8208;state ionization potential, is proposed to quantify the charging performance of amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using the descriptor and a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based model, 3 promising molecules are identified out of 1.17 million candidates via high&#8208;throughput screening. The 3 new polymers are successfully synthesized and experimentally validated to have excellent charge&#8208;trapping performance as electret materials.








Abstract
Electret materials are promising dielectric materials with trapped charges for various applications such as vibration energy harvesters and acoustic transducers. In the present work, ionization potential is discovered as the descriptor to quantify the charging performance for amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using this descriptor, high&#8208;throughput computations, and graph neural network models, 1&#160;176&#160;591 functional groups are screened on the cyclic transparent optical polymers (CYTOP), and 3 promising electrets are identified. The electrets are synthesized experimentally as 15 &#181;m&#8208;thick films. The films are able to keep their both bipolar surface potentials above &#177;3.1&#160;kV for over 1500 h and are estimated to have longevity of 146 years under 80&#160;&#176;C, achieving significant improvements on charging stability among CYTOP&#8208;based polymer electrets. The excellent bipolar charging performance can greatly enhance power generation capacity of electret&#8208;based vibration energy harvesters. This work also demonstrates the use of deep learning as a new paradigm for accelerating practical materials discovery.

         <title>Core Electron Count as a Versatile and Accurate New Descriptor for Sorting Mechanical Properties of Diverse Transition Metal Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;electron consideration of both valence electron concentration (VEC) and core electron count (CEC) is invoked in developing a distinct VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor to sort mechanical properties of diverse transition&#8208;metal compounds with higher accuracy and versatility compared to many other commonly used descriptors. A fresh path is thus opened for rational design and optimization of these compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal light&#8208;element compounds show superb mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties, and accurate descriptors are important to sorting targeted properties among this vast class of materials. Valence electron concentration (VEC) can track broad trends of mechanical properties, but this widely used descriptor suffers low accuracy with sorted data strongly scattered along trendlines, necessitating an improved sorting strategy. Here, elastic parameters from first&#8208;principles calculations are examined for 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMN) in cubic structure and 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal diborides (TMB2) in hexagonal structure and identify core electron count (CEC) of the solvent atoms as a new descriptor. Combined with VEC, the composite VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor exhibits greatly improved ability to sort elastic parameters of distinct TMN and TMB2 compounds. Unregulated property variations under the VEC description are well&#8208;captured by CEC, which tends to enhance ductility and reduce strength at fixed VEC and rising CEC. By invoking a full&#8208;electron consideration, the VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor accounts for the impact on bonding behaviors by both core and valence electrons with much&#8208;improved accuracy and versatility in sorting mechanical properties of diverse TM compounds compared to many other commonly used descriptors, opening a fresh path for rational design and optimization of TM compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.

         <title>Unleashing the Full Potential of Photo&#8208;Driven CO&#160;Hydrogenation to Light Olefins over Carbon&#8208;Coated CoMn&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light for converting syngas to light olefins. Through the coupling of photo&#8208;thermocatalysis and photocatalysis (between MnO and Co with carbon mediation), the catalyst unleashes the full potential of a photodriven reaction, achieving 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermal catalysis.








Abstract
As a nonpetroleum process, photodriven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis provides a practical approach for the synthesis of light olefins. However, maximizing the solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency based on the design of the composite catalyst and understanding the catalytic mechanism remain challenging. Herein, a novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed for the efficient conversion of syngas to light olefins under light irradiation. The CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst exhibits a CO conversion of 12.6% with a selectivity to light olefins of 36.5% under light irradiation, showing 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermocatalysis. Experimental characterizations as certain the CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst can be excited to generate photogenerated carriers under light irradiation and then the electron transfer to metallic Co to form electron&#8208;rich active sites with carbon mediation, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculation based on density functional theory reveal the unique roles of photogenerated carriers in promoting the adsorption and activation of CO molecules. This study demonstrates a feasible catalyst model to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light to produce the value&#8208;added chemical.

         <title>Modeling Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic structure calculations are an essential complement to experiments to characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, simulating SACs with quantum chemistry approaches is not as simple as often thought. Unless a number of essential aspects are adequately considered, the predictive power of electronic structure calculations remains limited. This perspective discusses&#160;what aspects need to be included to perform a reliable simulation of SACs.








Abstract
Electronic structure calculations represent an essential complement of experiments to characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), consisting of isolated metal atoms stabilized on a support, but also to predict new catalysts. However, simulating SACs with quantum chemistry approaches is not as simple as often assumed. In this work,&#160;the essential factors that characterize a reliable simulation of SACs activity are examined. The Perspective focuses on the importance of precise atomistic characterization of the active site, since even small changes in the metal atom's surroundings can result in large changes in reactivity. The dynamical behavior and stability of SACs under working conditions, as well as the importance of adopting appropriate methods to solve the Schr&#246;dinger equation for a quantitative evaluation of reaction energies are addressed. The Perspective also focuses on the relevance of the model adopted. For electrocatalysis this must include the effects of the solvent, the presence of electrolytes, the pH, and the external potential. Finally, it is discussed how the similarities between SACs and coordination compounds may result in reaction intermediates that usually are not observed on metal electrodes. When these aspects are not adequately considered, the predictive power of electronic structure calculations is quite limited.

         <title>Confining Prepared Ultra&#8208;Small Nanozymes Loading Ato for Lung Cancer Catalytic Therapy/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanozymes with inherent enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic properties combat malignant tumor progression via catalytic therapy, while the therapeutic efficacy still needs to be improved. In this work, we innovatively synthesized ultra&#8208;small platinum nanozymes (nPt) in confined domain of wormlike pore channel in gold nanobipyramidal&#8208;mesoporous silica dioxide nanocomposites, producing nanozyme carriers AP&#8208;mSi with photo&#8208;enhanced peroxidase ability. Afterwards, based on the prepared AP&#8208;mSi, the lung cancer nanozymes probe (AP&#8208;HAI) was ingeniously produced by removing SiO2 template, modifying HSA, and loading ATO as well as IR780. Under NIR light irradiation, inner AuP and IR780 collaborated for photothermal process, thus facilitating the peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic process of H2O2. Additionally, loaded atovaquone molecules (ATO), a cell respiration inhibitor, could impair tumor respiration metabolism and cause oxygen retention, hence enhancing IR780's PDT effectiveness. In a result, IR780's PDT property and nPt nanozymes' photo&#8208;enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like ability endowed probes a high ROS productivity, eliciting anti&#8208;tumor immune responses to destroy tumor tissue. Systematic studies revealed that the obvious ROS generation was obtained by the strategy of using nPt nanozymes and reducing oxygen consumption by ATO, which in turn enabled lung cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/ICD&#8208;based immunotherapy. The results of this work would provide theoretical justification for the practical use of photo&#8208;enhanced nanozyme probes.

         <title>Regulating Intramolecular Electron Transfer of Nickel&#8208;Based Coordinations through Ligand Engineering for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The integration of electronic effects into complexes for the construction of novel materials has not yet attracted significant attention in the field of energy storage. In the current study, eight one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nickel&#8208;based salicylic acid (SA) complexes, Ni&#8208;XSAs (X = pH, pMe, pMeO, mMe, pBr, pCl, pF, and pCF3), are prepared by ligand engineering. The coordination environments in the Ni&#8208;XSAs are explored using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The charge transfer of the complexes is modulated according to the difference in the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituents, in combination with frontier orbital theory. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) is used to investigate the effect of the substituent position on the electronic properties of the complexes. Ni&#8208;mMeSA exhibits better electrical conductivity than Ni&#8208;pMeSA. The electrochemical performance of Ni&#8208;mMeSA as an aqueous battery cathode is remarkably improved with a maximum energy density of 0.30 mWh cm&#8722;2 (125.00&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and a peak power density of 33.72&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 (14.03&#160;kW kg&#8722;1). This study provides ideas for the application of new coordination chemistry in the field of energy materials science.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), ZIF&#8208;8, which is stable at neutral and slightly basic pH values in aqueous solutions and destabilized/dissolved under acidic conditions w as loaded with a pH&#8208;insensitive fluorescent dye, rhodamine&#8208;B isothiocyanate, as a model payload species. Then, the MOF species w ere immobilized at an electrode surface. The local (interfacial) pH value w as rapidly decreased by means of an electrochemically stimulated ascorbate oxidation at +0.4&#160;V (Ag/AgCl/KCl). Oxygen reduction upon switching the applied potential to &#8722;0.8&#160;V, allowed to return the local pH to the neutral/basic pH, then stopping rapidly the release process. The developed method allowed electrochemical control over stimulated or inhibited payload release processes from the MOF. The pH variation proceeded in a thin film of the solution near the electrode surface. The switchable release process w as realized in a buffer solution and undiluted human serum. As the second option, the pH decrease stimulating the release process w as achieved upon an enzymatic reaction using esterase and ester substrate. This approach potentially allows the release activation controlled by numerous enzymes assembled in complex biocatalytic cascades. It is expected that related electrochemical or biocatalytic systems can represent novel signal&#8208;responding materials with the switchable features for delivering (bio)molecules within biomedical applications.

         <title>Theranostic Lipid Nanoparticles for Renal Cell Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological malignancy and represents a leading threat to healthcare. Recent years have seen a series of progresses in the early diagnosis and management of RCC. Theranostic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are increasingly one of the focuses in this field, because of their suitability for tumor targeting and multimodal therapy. LNPs can be precisely fabricated with desirable chemical compositions and biomedical properties, which closely match the physiological characteristics and clinical needs of RCC. Herein, a comprehensive review of theranostic LNPs is presented, emphasizing the generic tool nature of LNPs in developing advanced micro&#8208;nano biomaterials. It begins with a brief overview of the compositions and formation mechanism of LNPs, followed with an introduction to kidney&#8208;targeting approaches, such as passive, active, and stimulus responsive targeting. With examples provided, a series of modification strategies for enhancing the tumor targeting and functionality of LNPs were discussed. Thereafter, research advances on applications of these LNPs for RCC including bioimaging, liquid biopsy, drug delivery, physical therapy, and gene therapy are summarized and discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective. The final part highlights the milestone achievements of translation medicine, current challenges as well as future development directions of LNPs for the diagnosis and treatment of RCC.

         <title>Precisely Inhibiting Excessive Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis to Efficiently Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Oral Pifithrin&#8208;&#945; Embedded Nanomedicine (OPEN)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has seriously affected the life quality of patients. IBD develops due to excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, disrupting the gut barrier, colonizing harmful bacteria, and initiating persistent inflammation. The current therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation are limited. Although IBD can be treated significantly by directly preventing IEC apoptosis, achieving this therapeutic approach remains challenging. Accordingly, we are the first to develop an oral pifithrin&#8208;&#945; (PFT&#945;, a highly specific p53 inhibitor) embedded nanomedicine (OPEN) to effectively treat IBD by inhibiting excessive IEC apoptosis. As a major hub for various stressors, p53 is a central determinant of cell fate, and its inhibition can effectively reduce excessive IEC apoptosis. The tailored OPEN can precisely inhibit the off&#8208;target and inactivation resulting from PFT&#945; entry into the bloodstream. Subsequently, it persistently targets IBD lesions with high specificity to inhibit the pathological events caused by excessive IEC apoptosis. Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first&#8208;line drugs 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.

         <title>In Situ Regulating Cobalt/Iron Oxide&#8208;Oxyhydroxide Exchange by Dynamic Iron Incorporation for Robust Oxygen Evolution at Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The key dilemma for green hydrogen production via electrocatalytic water splitting is the high overpotential required for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co/Fe&#8208;based materials show superior catalytic OER activity to noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, but still lag far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni/Fe&#8208;based catalysts probably due to undesirable side segregation of FeOOH with poor conductivity and unsatisfied structural durability under large current density. Here we report a robust and durable OER catalyst affording current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at extremely low overpotentials of 290 and 304&#160;mV in base. This catalyst is evolved from amorphous bimetallic FeOOH/Co(OH)2 heterostructure microsheet arrays fabricated by a facile mechanical stirring strategy. Especially, in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman analysis decipher the rapid reconstruction of FeOOH/Co(OH)2 into dynamically stable Co1&#8208;xFexOOH active phase through in situ iron incorporation into CoOOH, which perform as the real active sites accelerating the rate&#8208;determining step supported by density functional theory calculations. By coupling with MoNi4/MoO2 cathode, the self&#8208;assembled alkaline electrolyzer could deliver 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.613&#160;V, better than commercial IrO2(+)||Pt/C(&#8208;) and most of reported transition metal&#8208;based electrolyzers. Our work provides a feasible strategy to the exploration and design of industrial water splitting catalysts for large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Switching Memristor&#8208;Based Compute&#8208;In&#8208;Memory Module for Deep Neural Network Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The need for deep neural network (DNN) models with higher performance and better functionality leads to the proliferation of very large models. Model training, however, requires intensive computation time and energy. Memristor&#8208;based compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) modules can perform vector&#8208;matrix multiplication (VMM) in situ and in parallel, and have shown great promises in DNN inference applications. However, CIM&#8208;based model training faces challenges due non&#8208;linear weight updates, device variations, and low&#8208;precision in analog computing circuits. In this work, we experimentally implement a mixed&#8208;precision training scheme to mitigate these effects using a bulk&#8208;switching memristor CIM module. Low&#8208;precision CIM modules are used to accelerate the expensive VMM operations, with high precision weight updates accumulated in digital units. Memristor devices are only changed when the accumulated weight update value exceeds a pre&#8208;defined threshold. The proposed scheme is implemented with a system on chip (SoC) of fully integrated analog CIM modules and digital sub&#8208;systems, showing fast convergence of LeNet training to 97.73%. The efficacy of training larger models is evaluated using realistic hardware parameters and shows that that analog CIM modules can enable efficient mix&#8208;precision DNN training with accuracy comparable to full&#8208;precision software trained models. Additionally, models trained on chip are inherently robust to hardware variations, allowing direct mapping to CIM inference chips without additional re&#8208;training.

Memristor-based compute-in-memory (CIM) modules can perform vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) in situ and in parallel, and have shown great promises in DNN inference applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Sensing Platform Based on 2D Monoelement Germanane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;assisted fluorometric sensing platform based on CH3Ge&#8208;coated paper is developed. CH3Ge paper is suitable for sensing humidity as well as acidic and alkaline gases emitted by spoiled food to track its quality. Further, it is used for printing confidential information using a water inkjet printer and shows significant re&#8208;writability.








Abstract
Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl&#8208;functionalized germanane (CH3Ge) is developed for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Luminescence (red&#8211;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH3Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH3Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH3Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). To demonstrate real&#8208;time and on&#8208;the&#8208;spot testing, absorbed gas molecules are first precisely quantified by CH3Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH3Ge&#8208;paper&#8208;based sensor is integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. Finally, CH3Ge&#8208;based rewritable paper is applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.

&lt;p&gt;A smartphone-assisted fluorometric sensing platform based on CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge-coated paper is developed. CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge paper is suitable for sensing humidity as well as acidic and alkaline gases emitted by spoiled food to track its quality. Further, it is used for printing confidential information using a water inkjet printer and shows significant re-writability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl-functionalized germanane (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge) is developed for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti-counterfeiting. Luminescence (red&#8211;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). To demonstrate real-time and on-the-spot testing, absorbed gas molecules are first precisely quantified by CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge-paper-based sensor is integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. Finally, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge-based rewritable paper is applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase perovskite BDASnI4 is identified to be promising for constructing high&#8211;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). By developing interface and additive engineering strategies, BDASnI4 FETs achieve mobility of 1.61 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Moreover, the devices remain functional after being exposed to ambient conditions (temperature of 45 &#8451; and humidity of 45%) for over 150 h.&#160; 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites hold immense potential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the instability of perovskite&#8208;based transistors has impeded their progress and practical applications. Here, ambient&#8208;stable high&#8208;performance FETs based on 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase tin halide perovskite BDASnI4, which has high film quality and excellent electrical properties, are reported. The perovskite channels are established by engineering the film crystallization process via the employment of ammonium salt interlayers and the incorporation of NH4SCN additives within the precursor solution. The refined FETs demonstrate field&#8208;effect hole mobilities up to 1.61 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio surpassing 106. Moreover, the devices show impressive operational and environmental stability and retain their functional performance even after being exposed to ambient conditions with a temperature of 45 &#176;C and humidity of 45% for over 150 h.

         <title>Dendritic Nanomedicine with Boronate Bonds for Augmented Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Tumor Immune Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Unsatisfied tumor accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs and a complicated immunosuppressive microenvironment diminish the immune response rate and the therapeutic effect. Surface modification of these drugs with target ligands can promote their cellular internalization, but the modified drugs may be subjected to unexpected immune recognition and clearance. Herein, a phenylboronic acid (PBA) group&#8208;shieldable dendritic nanomedicine that integrates an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agent (epirubicin, Epi) and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxgenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor (NLG919) is reported for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. This NLG919&#8208;loaded Epi&#8208;conjugated PEGylated dendrimers bridged with boronate bonds (NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP) maintains a stable nanostructure during circulation. Under a moderate acidic condition, the PBA group exposes to the sialic acid residue on the tumor cell membrane to enhance the internalization and penetration of NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP. At pH 5.0, NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP rapidly disassembles to release the incorporated Epi and NLG919. Epi triggers robust ICD of tumor cells that evokes strong immune response. In addition, inhibition of the IDO1 activity downregulates the metabolism of L&#8208;tryptophan to kynurenine, leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Collectively, this promising strategy has been demonstrated to evoke robust immune response as well as remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment for an enhanced chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect.

         <title>A Smart Single&#8208;Fluorophore Polymer: Self&#8208;Assembly Shapechromic Multicolor Fluorescence And Erasable Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A novel smart fluorescent polymer PGP was developed by incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers at molecular level. They are amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8208;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites. PGP exhibits smart deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. It can deform into three typical shapes with a characteristic fluorescence color, namely, spherical core&#8208;shell micelles of cyan&#8208;green fluorescence, standard rectangular nanosheets of yellow fluorescence, and irregular branches of deep&#8208;blue fluorescence. A quasi&#8208;reversible deformation between the first two shapes can be dynamically manipulated. Moreover, driven by reversible coordination and resulted intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, PGP can be used as an aqueous fluorescence ink with erasable and recoverable properties. The fluorescent patterns printed by PGP ink on paper can be rapidly erased and recovered by simple spraying a sequence of Cu2+ and EDTA aqueous solutions. This erase/recover transformation can be repeated multiple times on the same paper. The multiple stimulus responsiveness of PGP makes it have potential applications in nanorobots, sensing, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Assemblable Bespoke Scaffold as a Versatile Microcryogel Carrier for Site&#8208;Specific Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE) can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so surgeons can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. This simple and cost&#8208;effective patient&#8208;specific implant reduces the healthcare system burden.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing have led to diverse patient&#8208;specific implant designs utilizing computed tomography, but this requires intensive work and financial implications. Here, Digital Light Processing is used to fabricate a hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE). HIVE can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so a surgeon can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect before implantation. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels (MC) incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. After characterization, possible site&#8208;specific applications are investigated by utilizing HIVE as a versatile carrier with incorporated treatments such as growth factors (GF), bioceramic, or cells. HIVE as a GF&#8208;carrier shows a controlled release of bone morphogenetic protein/vascular endothelial growth factor (BMP/VEGF) and induced osteogenesis/angiogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)/human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, as a bioceramic&#8208;carrier, HIVE demonstrates enhanced mineralization and osteogenesis, and as a HUVEC carrier, it upregulates both osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression of hMSCs. HIVE with different combinations of MCs yields a distinct local effect and successful cell migration is confirmed within assembled HIVEs. Finally, an in vivo&#160;rat subcutaneous implantation demonstrates site&#8208;specific osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

         <title>Dynamically Adaptive Bubbling for Upgrading Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Lamellar Fern&#8208;Like Alloy Aerogel Self&#8208;Standing Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Adopting intermittent renewable electricity to produce &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen has been a critical challenge because at a high current density the mass transfer capability of most catalytic electrodes deteriorates significantly. Herein, we report a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) as a self&#8208;standing electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. The LFA electrode is intrinsically highly catalytic&#8208;active and shows a highly porous, resilient, hierarchically ordered, and well&#8208;percolated conductive network. It not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities, evidenced by showing the record lowest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 244&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and continuously catalyzing OER for over 6000 hours. With the merits of mechanical robustness, excellent electron transport, and efficient bubble evacuation, LFA can be an ideal motif of a self&#8208;standing catalytic electrode in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), also functioning as the gas diffusion layers, which can achieve 3000 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.88&#160;V and can sustain stable electrolysis at 2000&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1300 hours. This strategy can be extended to various gas evolution reactions as a general design rule for multiphase catalysis applications.

Abstract
Enabling the living capability of secreting liquids dynamically triggered by external stimuli while maintaining the bulk frame is a significant challenge for mucosa&#8208;inspired hydrogels. A mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed in this study using the synergy between electro&#8208;responsive silk supramolecular non&#8208;covalent networks and covalent polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol polymer networks. The formed supramolecular&#8208;covalent hydrogel exhibits a partial gel&#8208;sol transition upon the application of an electric field, and the liquid layer on the hydrogel surface near the cathode is used to mimic the mucus&#8208;secreting capability to regulate lubrication. The electro&#8208;responsive lubricating process can operate under a safe voltage and exhibits good reversibility. It is also a universal strategy is to construct an electro&#8208;responsive hydrogel by introducing an electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular network into the polymer network. This mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular&#8208;covalent hydrogel offers a promising method for designing soft actuators or robots that can regulate lubrication using an electric strategy.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Based on Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a crucial role in developing lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high safety and energy density. Exploring SSEs with excellent comprehensive performance is the key to achieving the practical application of LMBs. In this work, we demonstrate the great potential of Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 (LNFP) as an ideal SSE due to its enhanced ionic conductivity and reliable stability in contact with lithium metal anode. Moreover, LNFP&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are prepared to further improve electronic insulation and interface stability. The CSE containing 50 wt% of LNFP (LNFP50) shows high ionic conductivity (3.58 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and good compatibility with Li metal anode and cathodes. Surprisingly, the LMB of Li|LNFP50|LiFePO4 cell at 0.5 C current density shows good cycling stability (151.5 mAh g&#8722;1 for 500 cycles, 96.5% capacity retention, and 99.3% Coulombic efficiency), and high&#8208;energy LMB of Li|LNFP50|Li[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 cell maintains 80% capacity retention after 170 cycles, which are better than that with traditional liquid electrolytes (LEs). This investigation offers a new approach to commercializing SSEs with excellent comprehensive performance for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Engineering A Boron&#8208;Rich Interphase with Nonflammable Electrolyte Towards Stable Li||NCM811 Cells Under Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the high energy of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode, it still suffers serious decay due to the continuous solvents decomposition and unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers, especially under high temperatures. The intense exothermic reaction between delithiated NCM811 and flammable organic solvents, on the other hand, pushes the batteries to their safety limit. Herein, we tackle these two issues via engineering the electrolytes, i.e., utilizing salts with higher HOMO levels and nonflammable solvents with lower HOMO levels, to reduce the massive decomposition of solvents on the cathode side and improve battery safety under elevated temperatures. Consequently, a thin and boron&#8208;rich CEI was generated on the surface of NCM811, which effectively inhibited the side reactions and particle cracks, thus improving the cycling stability and safety. Deviated from the highly concentrated electrolytes which heavily relies on the usage of massive salts, our electrolyte recipe could introduce a robust inorganic&#8208;rich CEI but use much less salt (i.e., dilute electrolyte), and thus, offer an encouraging alternative towards practical applications. As such, by adopting the proposed electrolyte, the NCM811 cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 81.2% after 950 cycles at 25&#176;C and 75% after 300 cycles at 55&#176;C. This work provides a universal electrolyte design strategy for designing stable and safe high&#8208;temperature electrolytes for the NCM811 cathode.

         <title>Polysulfides in Magnesium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mg&#8208;S batteries hold great promise as a potential alternative to Li&#8208;based technologies. Their further development hinges on solving a few key challenges, including the lower capacity and poorer cycling performance when compared to Li counterparts. At the heart of the issues is the lack of knowledge on polysulfide chemical behaviors in the Mg&#8208;S battery environment. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of polysulfide behaviors in Mg&#8208;S batteries. First, we provide a systematic summary of experimental and computational techniques for polysulfide characterization. Next, conversion pathways for Mg polysulfide species within the battery environment are discussed, highlighting the important role of polysulfide solubility in determining reaction kinetics and overall battery performance. The focus then shifts to negative effects of polysulfide shuttling on Mg&#8208;S batteries. We outline various strategies for achieving an optimal balance between polysulfide solubility and shuttling, including use of electrolyte additives, polysulfide&#8208;trapping materials, and dual&#8208;functional catalysts. Based on the current understanding, we identify directions for further advancing knowledge of Mg polysulfide chemistry, emphasizing the integration of experiment with computation as a powerful approach to accelerate the development of Mg&#8208;S battery technology.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Based Selective Material Processing for Next&#8208;Generation Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The connection between laser&#8208;based material processing and additive manufacturing is quite deeply rooted. In fact, the spark that started the field of additive manufacturing was the idea that two intersecting laser beams could selectively solidify a vat of resin. Ever since, laser has been accompanying the field of additive manufacturing, with its repertoire expanded from processing only photopolymer resin to virtually any material, allowing liberating customizability. As a result, additive manufacturing is expected to take an even more prominent role in the global supply chain in years to come. Herein, an overview of laser&#8208;based selective material processing is presented from various aspects: the physics of laser&#8208;material interactions, the materials currently used in additive manufacturing processes, the system configurations that enable laser&#8208;based additive manufacturing, and various functional applications of next&#8208;generation additive manufacturing. Additionally, current challenges and prospects of laser&#8208;based additive manufacturing are discussed.

Abstract
Developing bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we propose an approach through density functional theory (DFT) pre&#8208;analysis to manipulate electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. The needle&#8208;like Fe&#8208;doped Ni2P with P vacancy (Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv) was successfully synthesized on nickel foam, exhibiting a superior bifunctional HER and OER catalytic activity for seawater electrolysis in alkaline condition. As a result, bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieve the industrially required current densities of 1.0 and 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 at low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73&#160;V, respectively, for seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;M KOH circumstances. The theoretical calculation and the experimental results collectively reveal the reasons for the enhancement of catalyst activity. Specifically, Fe doping and P vacancies could accelerate the reconstruction of OER active species and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) for HER. In addition, the active site of Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. Our study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel&#8208;based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.

         <title>Directional Shunting of Photogenerated Carriers in POM@MOF for Promoting Nitrogen Adsorption and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 composite is prepared by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction, which realizes an effective photocatalyst for storing and relaying oxidation N2 by inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers under mild conditions. The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits the high N2 adsorption capacity (250.5&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1) and superior N2 oxidation performance to produce HNO3 (702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The efficient catalysis of nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing products plays a crucial role in the N economic cycle. However, weak N2 adsorption and invalid N2 activation remain two major bottlenecks in rate&#8208;determining steps, leading to low N2 fixation performance. Herein, an effective dual active sites photocatalyst of polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highlighted via altering coordination microenvironment and inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers to facilitate N2/catalyst interaction and enhance oxidation performance. MOFs create more open unsaturated metal cluster sites with unoccupied d orbital possessing Lewis acidity to accept electrons from the 3&#963;g bonding orbital of N2 for storage by combining with POMs to replace bidentate linkers. POMs act as electron sponges donating electrons to MOFs, while the holes directional flow to POMs. The hole&#8208;rich POMs with strong oxidation capacity are easily involved in oxidizing adsorbed N2. Taking UiO&#8208;66 (C48H28O32Zr6) and Mo72Fe30 ([Mo72Fe30O252(CH3COO)12{Mo2O7(H2O)}2{H2Mo2O8(H2O)}(H2O)91]&#183;150H2O) as an example, Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 shows twofold enhanced adsorption of N2 (250.5&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) than UiO&#8208;66 (122.9&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1) at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1. And, the HNO3 yield of Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 is 702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;7&#160;times and 24 times higher than UiO&#8208;66 and Mo72Fe30. This work provides reliable value for the storage and relaying artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>Toward Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Crystal Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing membrane consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) layers is demonstrated. Two CLCs layers with same helical structure act as reflectors to construct a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. The selective reflection of CLCs leads to polarization selectivity. The membrane device is highly flexible and all&#8208;solution&#8208;processable and exhibits a high dissymmetry factor of 1.4.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultraflexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultraflexibility enables the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from a PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultraflexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases and Hyaluronan Synthase: A Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal dual&#8208;bionic nanozyme (MPMP), mimicking antioxidases and hyaluronan synthase, is developed for effective osteoarthritis (OA) therapy, which can produce heat, scavenge free radical and promote chondrogenesis even if under inflammatory conditions. This nanozyme regulates anabolic and catabolic processes simultaneously, thereby restoring joint homeostasis effectively and demonstrating an admirable photothermally therapeutic&#160; effect on OA.








Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8208;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, a dual&#8208;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) is constructed to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowers the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8208;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contribute to eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;2&#8211;/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF&#8208;&#954;B/IL&#8208;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8208;NIR shows HAS&#8208;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12&#8208;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8208;NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70&#8208;fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8208;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;/DPPH/ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and supplying O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF-&#954;B/IL-17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, MPMP-NIR shows HAS-mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12-fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP-NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70-fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual-bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Observation of Phonon Polaritons in Wafer&#8208;Scale Multilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared nanoimaging reveals propagating phonon polaritons on wafer&#8208;scale nanometer&#8208;thick hexagonal boron nitride grown by chemical vapor deposition. The material quality allows for the fabrication of phonon polariton nanoresonators with quality factors comparable to those fabricated from exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride, paving the way for wafer&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Polaritons in layered materials (LMs) are a promising platform to manipulate and control light at the nanometer scale. Thus, the observation of polaritons in wafer&#8208;scale LMs is critically important for the development of industrially relevant nanophotonics and optoelectronics applications. In this work, phonon polaritons (PhPs) in wafer&#8208;scale multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition are reported. By infrared nanoimaging, the PhPs are visualized, and PhP lifetimes of &#8776;0.6&#160;ps are measured, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. Further, PhP nanoresonators are demonstrated. Their quality factors of &#8776;50 are about 0.7 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices based on exfoliated hBN. These results can enable PhP&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Driven Tribo&#8208;Electrophoresis Enabled Human&#8211;Droplet Interaction in 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel human&#8211;droplet interaction platform rooted in the TEP approach is demonstrated, eliminating the need for complex electrodes and external power sources. By employing a well&#8208;designed triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer, precise and flexible manipulation of droplets in 3D space is achieved through human motion, fostering enhanced synergy and flexibility between humans and droplets.








Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences, and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, a novel method is proposed, which&#160;leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8211;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. The approach involves the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer&#160;that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting and stable transport in the clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with freedom to move in three dimensions but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8211;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

         <title>UV&#8208;Curing&#8208;Enhanced Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy to enhance long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing is reported, by which amorphous organic LPL materials show broader application prospects.








Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, where the luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, a universal strategy is proposed to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing a generation of materials with highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area, and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, nondestructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Mid&#8208;Infrared Bipolar and Unipolar Linear Polarization Detections in Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>

Abstract
Detecting and distinguishing light polarization states, one of the most basic elements of optical fields, have significant importance in both scientific studies and industry applications. Artificially fabricated structures, e.g., metasurfaces with anisotropic absorptions, have shown the capabilities of detecting polarization light and controlling polarization ratios (PRs). However, their operations mainly rely on resonant absorptions based on structural designs that are usually narrow band. Here, we demonstrate a mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) broadband polarization photodetector with high PRs and wavelength&#8208;dependent polarities using a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) anisotropic/isotropic Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructure. It is shown that the photodetector exhibits high PRs of 48 and 34 at 4.6&#160;&#956;m and 11.0&#160;&#956;m wavelengths, respectively, and even a negative PR of &#8208;3.38 for 3.7&#160;&#956;m under the zero bias condition at room temperature. Such interesting results can be attributed to the superimposed effects of a photovoltaic (PV) mechanism in the Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 hetero&#8208;junction region and a bolometric mechanism in the MoS2 layer. Furthermore, the photodetector demonstrates its effectiveness in bipolar and unipolar polarization encoding communications and polarization imaging enabled by its unique and high PRs.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Configurable MXene&#8208;Based Thermoacoustic Loudspeakers with Tunable Sound Directivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Film&#8208;type shape&#8208;configurable speakers with tunable sound directivity are in high demand for wearable electronics. Flexible, thin thermoacoustic (TA) loudspeakers&#8212;which are free from bulky vibrating diaphragms&#8212;show promise in this regard. However, configuring thin TA loudspeakers into arbitrary shapes is challenging because of their low sound pressure level (SPL) under mechanical deformations and low conformability to other surfaces. By carefully controlling the heat&#8208;capacity&#8208;per&#8208;unit&#8208;area and thermal effusivity of an MXene conductor and substrates, respectively, we fabricated an ultrathin MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeaker exhibiting high SPL output (74.5&#160;dB at 15&#160;kHz) and stable sound performance for 14 days. Loudspeakers with the parylene substrate, whose thickness was less than the thermal penetration depth, generated bidirectional and deformation&#8208;independent sound in bent, twisted, cylindrical, and stretched&#8208;kirigami configurations. Furthermore, we constructed parabolic and spherical versions of ultrathin, large&#8208;area (20&#160;cm &#215; 20&#160;cm) MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeakers, which displayed sound&#8208;focusing and 3D omnidirectional&#8208;sound&#8208;generating attributes, respectively.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.








Abstract
Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme&#8208;like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme&#8208;CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. These OSDs' prevention nanozyme&#8208;CCLs can pave the way for CCLs toward powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor deposition method in combination with a solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization technique is presented to fabricate high&#8208;quality larger&#8208;area perovskite film. Efficiency of 19.9% is achieved, which is among the highest values ever reported for minimodules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

         <title>Synergizing Spatial Confinement and Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysis to Boost Sulfur Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Fish&#8208;in&#8208;net&#8221; encapsulation of sulfur nanoparticles in an ordered metal&#8211;organic framework is reported as an efficient strategy for overcoming the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This approach results in long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption, and decent multistep catalytic conversion, thereby significantly improving the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and sulfur conversion rate.








Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues can enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2 C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads with Flexible Spacers: Deciphering Complex Photophysics for Targeted Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads are deciphered for practical use in materials science. In solution, fluorescent exciplexes are formed only for the short spacer (n = 4). Upon freezing, emissive static charge transfer (CT) complexes are formed for all spacer lengths. The molecular solids are stimuli&#8208;responsive, showing on/off fluorescence switching (n &gt; 4) or change of the emission color (n = 4).








Abstract
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads with varying flexible spacer lengths (n = 4&#8211;10 carbon atoms) are investigated in liquid and solid solution, as well as in crystals, by steady&#8208;state and transient fluorescence spectroscopy combined with computational studies. For the short spacer (n = 4) in a liquid solution, dynamic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state formation with subsequent, efficient exciplex emission is observed, effectively competing with quenching through electron transfer (eT) via a radical ion pair. In a solid solution, a fluorescent CT static complex is formed upon freezing for all spacer lengths. This allows the observations of a former seminal report on stimuli&#8208;responsive high&#8208;contrast fluorescence on/off switching in films of the triads to be reassigned (Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 5487), now providing a holistic picture on varying spacer length. In fact, external stimuli of the film by modulating the geometry of the CT complex, which results in on/off fluorescence switching (for n &gt; 4) or in a change of the emission color (n = 4). The work thus demonstrates how in&#8208;depth analysis of complex photophysics can be put to practical use in materials science.

         <title>Highly&#8208;efficient Nitrogen&#8208;Fixing Microbial Hydrogel Device for Sustainable Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conversion of sunlight and organic carbon substrates to sustainable energy sources through microbial metabolism has great potential for the renewable energy industry. Despite recent progress in microbial photosynthesis, the development of microbial platforms that warrant efficient and scalable fuel production remains in its infancy. Efficient transfer and retrieval of gaseous reactants and products to and from microbes are particular hurdles. Here, inspired by water lily leaves floating on water, we present a microbial device designed to operate at the air&#8208;water interface and facilitate concomitant supply of gaseous reactants, smooth capture of gaseous products, and efficient sunlight delivery. The floatable device carrying Rhodopseudomonas parapalustris, of which nitrogen fixation activity is firstly determined through this study, exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 104&#160;mmol/h&#8729;m2, which is 53 times higher than that of a conventional device placed at a depth of 2&#160;cm in the medium. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up device with an area of 144 cm2 generates hydrogen at a high rate of 1.52 L/h&#8729;m2. Efficient nitrogen fixation and hydrogen generation, low fabrication cost, and mechanical durability corroborate the potential of the floatable microbial device toward practical and sustainable solar energy conversion.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) have emerged as a promising optoelectronic Neuromorphic computing paradigm, opening up new opportunities for neurosynaptic devices and optoelectronic systems. These OMs possess a range of desirable features including minimal crosstalk, high bandwidth, low power consumption, zero latency, and the ability to replicate crucial neurological functions such as vision and optical memory. By incorporating large&#8208;scale parallel synaptic structures, OMs are anticipated to greatly enhance high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power in&#8208;memory computing, effectively overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann bottleneck. However, progress in this field necessitates a comprehensive understanding of suitable structures and techniques for integrating low&#8208;dimensional materials into optoelectronic integrated circuit platforms. This review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanisms, design of structures, applications, and integration roadmap of optoelectronic synaptic memristors. By establishing connections between materials, multilayer optoelectronic memristor units, and monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits, this review seeks to provide insights into emerging technologies and future prospects that are expected to drive innovation and widespread adoption in the near future.

         <title>Orderly Nanodendritic Nickel Substitute for Raney Nickel Catalyst Improving Alkali Water Electrolyser</title>

Abstract
The development of nonprecious metal catalysts to meet the activity&#8208;stability balance at industrial&#8208;grade large current densities remains a challenge toward practical alkali&#8208;water electrolysis. Here, we develop an orderly nanodendritic nickel (ND&#8208;Ni) catalyst that consists of ultrafine nanograins in chain&#8208;like&#160;conformation, which shows both excellent activity and robust stability for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, superior to currently&#8208;applied Raney nickel (R&#8208;Ni) catalyst in commercial alkali&#8208;water electrolyser (AWE). The ND&#8208;Ni catalyst featured by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnecting microporous structure endows with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity, which together afford superior charge/mass transport favorable to HER kinetics at high current densities. An actual AWE with ND&#8208;Ni catalyst demonstrates durable water splitting with 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.71&#160;V under industrial conditions and renders a record&#8208;low power consumption of 3.95&#160;kW h/Nm3 with an energy efficiency close to 90%. The hydrogen price per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) is calculated to be &#8764;0.78 US$, which is less than the target of US$2.0/GGE by 2026 from the U.S. Department of Energy. Our results suggest the feasibility of ND&#8208;Ni substitute for R&#8208;Ni catalyst in commercial AWE.

         <title>Identifying a Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal activity descriptor (orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy) is successfully extracted from various materials&#8217; physicochemical properties for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions in multiple electrolytes. Systematic experiments and computations reveal the life&#8208;cycle HER and OER mechanisms and identify the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory as a powerful mechanism analysis tool and foundation.








Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) is not yet developed. Moreover, a unifying concept is not yet established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over ten representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides are rationally bridged through statistical methodologies. The orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8776;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in the OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in the HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in the OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>Flash&#8208;Thermal Shock Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Toward High&#8208;Performance Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flash&#8208;thermal shock (FTS)&#8208;driven synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers and other 2D materials is presented. In particular, the FTS method merits scalability (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2), rapid synthesis (&gt;1800 &#160;&#176;C within 20 ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1), and ambient air processing. To prove their practical utility, high electrocatalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) provide unprecedented physicochemical properties over unary nanoparticles (NPs). According to the conventional alloying guideline (Hume&#8211;Rothery rule), however, only size&#8208;and&#8208;structure similar elements can be mixed, limiting the possible combinations of alloying elements. Recently, it has been reported that based on carbon thermal shocks (CTS) in a vacuum atmosphere at high temperature, ultrafast heating/cooling rates and high&#8208;entropy environment play a critical role in the synthesis of HEAs, ruling out the possibility of phase separation. Since the CTS requires conducting supports, the Joule&#8208;heating efficiencies rely on the carbon qualities, featuring difficulties in uniform heating along the large area. This work proposes a photo&#8208;thermal approach as an alternative and innovative synthetic method that is compatible with ambient air, large&#8208;area, remote process, and free of materials selection. Single flash irradiation on carbon nanofibers induced momentary high&#8208;temperature annealing (&gt;1800&#160;&#176;C within 20&#160;ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1) to successfully decorate HEA NPs up to nine elements with excellent compatibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2 of carbon nanofiber paper). To demonstrate their feasibility toward applications, senary HEA NPs (PtIrFeNiCoCe) are designed and screened, showing high activity (&#951;overall = 777&#160;mV) and excellent stability (&gt;5000 cycles) at the water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Controlling Crystallization Kinetics Simultaneously for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, eliminating I0, Pb0, and uncoordinated Pb2+ defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.








Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

&lt;p&gt;It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, eliminating I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;-tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F-(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high-performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and reducing newly generated I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time-resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurfaces without the Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing metasurface based on orthogonal phase encoding is demonstrated to implement a near&#8208;field optical router. Bragg diffraction, which plays a vital role in traditional volume holography,is replaced by mode&#8208;matching surface waves, resulting in the realization of ultrathin metadevices. The method facilitates further development of an additional degree of freedom in the field of photonic multiplexing.








Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the 2D nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in 3D space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the 2D design. An example of code&#8208;based all&#8208;optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which can find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Constructing Chiral Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional chiral covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (CityU&#8208;7 and CityU&#8208;8) have been developed for the detection of circularly polarized light, where both samples exhibited distinguishable photoresponse toward left&#8208;handed and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (at 405&#160;nm).








Abstract
The use of chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active elements in photodetectors to directly identify circularly polarized light (CPL) can meet the requirement of integration and miniaturization of the as&#8208;fabricated devices. Herein, the design and synthesis of two isoreticular chiral two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs (CityU&#8208;7 and CityU&#8208;8) by introducing photosensitive porphyrin&#8208;based amines (5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin) to enhance the optical absorption and chiral aldehyde linkage (2,5&#8208;bis((S/R))&#8208;2&#8208;methylbutoxy)terephthalaldehyde) to engender chirality for direct CPL detection &#160;are&#160; reported. Their crystalline structures &#160;were&#160; confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and low&#8208;dose transition electron microscopy. Employing both chiral COFs as the active layers in photodetectors, left&#8208;handed circularly (LHC) and right&#8208;handed circularly (RHC) polarized light at 405&#160;nm can be well distinguishable with short response time, high responsivity, and satisfying detectivity. The study provides the first example on the design and synthesis of chiral COFs for direct detection of CPL.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Ferromagnetic Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Programmed Dual&#8208;Anisotropy and Multi&#8208;Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic liquid crystal elastomer (magLCE) ink whose nematic order and magnetization can be independently programmed to be anisotropic via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform is reported. The 3D&#8208;printed magLCE provides designable multimodal shape morphing under different stimuli, which is promising for wireless soft robots and intelligent devices.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and magnetic soft materials are promising active materials in many emerging fields, such as soft robotics. Despite the high demand for developing active materials that combine the advantages of LCE and magnetic actuation, the lack of independent programming of the LCE nematic order and magnetization in a single material still hinders the desired multi&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization is developed that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as &#8220;dual anisotropy&#8221;, via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform. The magLCE ink is fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic microparticles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D&#8208;printing platform is created by integrating a magnet with 3&#8208;DoF motion into an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo&#8208;heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. A programmed magLCE strip robot is demonstrated with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi&#8208;actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multistable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Like Stretchable Nanocomposite Using Locally&#8208;Bundled Nanowires for Skin&#8208;Mountable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable nanocomposite with metal&#8208;like conductivity and high stretchability is proposed. When the nanocomposite is solidified in the highly humid air, silver nanowires are locally&#8208;bundled, minimizing contact resistance. Treatment of dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol improves conductivity further to &#8776;120 000 S cm&#8722;1 while attaining high stretchability of &#8776;200% for skin&#8208;mountable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable conductive nanocomposites have been intensively studied for wearable bioelectronics. However, development of nanocomposites that simultaneously feature metal&#8208;like conductivity(&gt; 100 000 S cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&gt; 100%) for high&#8208;performance skin&#8208;mountable devices is still extremely challenging. Here&#160;a material strategy for such a nanocomposite is&#160;presented by using local bundling of silver nanowires stabilized with dual ligands (i.e., 1&#8208;propanethiols and 1&#8208;decanethiols). When the nanocomposite&#160;is&#160;solidified via solvent evaporation under a highly humid condition, the nanowires in the organic solution are bundled and stabilized. The resulting locally&#8208;bundled nanowires lower contact resistance while maintain their percolation network, leading to high conductivity. Dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol further boost up the conductivity. As a result, a nanocomposite with both high conductivity of &#8776;122,120 S cm&#8722;1 and high stretchability of &#8776;200% is obtained. Such superb electrical and mechanical properties are critical for various applications in skin&#8208;like electronics, and&#160;herein, a wearable thermo&#8208;stimulation device is demonstrated.

         <title>Regulating Exciton De&#8208;Trapping of Te4+&#8208;Doped Zero&#8208;Dimensional Scandium&#8208;Halide Perovskite for Fluorescence Thermometry with Record High Time&#8208;Resolved Thermal Sensitivity</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive fluorescence thermometer is developed by Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O engineering. The rapid de&#8208;trapping process of self&#8208;trapped excitons induced by the soft lattice results in a record high thermal sensitivity for the lifetime&#8208;based detection, reaching up to 27.36% K&#8722;1 at 325 K, with the temperature uncertainty below 0.1 K, enabling remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components.








Abstract
Fluorescence thermometry has been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention due to its high spatial resolution and remote non&#8208;invasive detection. However, recent generations of thermometers still suffer from limited thermal sensitivity (Sr) below 10% change per Kelvin. Herein, this work presents an ideal temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence material through Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O, in which isolated polyhedrons endow highly localized electronic structures, and the strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling facilitates the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). With rising temperature, the dramatic asymmetric expansion of the soft lattice induces increased defects, strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, and low thermal activation energy, which evokes a rapid de&#8208;trapping process of STEs, enabling several orders of magnitude changes in the fluorescence lifetime over a narrow temperature range. After regulating the de&#8208;trapping process with different Te4+ doping, a record&#8208;high Sr (27.36% K&#8722;1) of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based detection is achieved at 325 K. The robust stability against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long&#8208;term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. It is believed that this work constitutes a solid step towards building the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halides.

         <title>Inhibited Grain Growth Through Phase Transition Modulation Enables Excellent Mechanical Properties in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers up to 1700&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase transition modulation strategy is proposed to prepare oxide ceramic nanofibers, which are featured by inhibited grain growth at high temperatures. As a result, a strikingly high average tensile strength of 1.02&#160;GPa is achieved at 1700&#160;&#176;C, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramics for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Oxide ceramics are widely used as thermal protection materials due to their excellent structural properties and earth abundance. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), the explosive growth of grain size causes irreversible damage to the microstructure of oxide ceramics, thus exhibiting poor thermomechanical stability. This problem, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, remains a great challenge for oxide ceramic materials. Here, a novel strategy of phase transition modulation is proposed to control the grain growth at high temperatures in oxide ceramic nanofibers, realizing effective regulation of the crystalline forms as well as the size uniformity of primary grains, and thus suppressing the malignant growth of the grains. The resulting oxide ceramic nanofibers have excellent mechanical strength and flexibility, delivering an average tensile strength as high as 1.02&#160;GPa after being exposed to 1700&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min, and can withstand thousands of flexural cycles without obvious damage. This work may provide new insight into the development of advanced oxide ceramic materials that can serve in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments with long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Universal Strategy of Efficient Intracellular Macromolecule Directional Delivery Using Photothermal Pump Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal pump patch is proposed as a universal structure for a highly efficient, non&#8208;destructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule directional delivery. It is based on poly(dimethyl siloxane) photothermal expansion&#8208;driven pore shrinkage, which directionally delivers macromolecules into the cell to improve intracellular delivery efficiency. It is also suitable for transdermal intracellular delivery and has broad potential in the fields of cell/gene therapy.








Abstract
The development of a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable universal delivery strategy of therapeutic macromolecules into desired cells and tissues is very challenging. Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; is reported. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high&#8208;efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high&#8208;efficiency, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable macromolecule delivery.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Anode&#8208;Free Batteries Enabled by Li Compensation Coupled Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of Li2S as a Li supplement and interfacial promoter facilitates efficient Li compensation coupled interface strengthening against irreversible Li loss, enabling a durable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free battery with long life, high energy, and remarkable safety.








Abstract
Initially, anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges the high production feasibility of Li&#8208;ion batteries with the superb energy capabilities of Li&#8208;metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero&#8208;Li&#8208;excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. A Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy is reported for realizing long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries. The Li2S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry. Meanwhile, it demonstrates remarkable efficacy in establishing a robust yet slender inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid solid&#8208;state interphase for inhibiting cell degradation by dead and dendritic Li. This strategy enables quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries with a long lifespan of 500 cycles. The Ah&#8208;scale quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, featuring a high&#8208;loading LiFePO4 cathode and lean gel polymer electrolyte, exhibit a high specific energy of 300&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1. This achievement translates into an improvement of 46% in gravimetric energy and 94% in volumetric energy compared to LiFePO4||graphite batteries while outperforming LiFePO4||Li&#8208;metal batteries by 22&#8211;47% in volumetric energy. Such quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free cells also demonstrate good safety, showcasing remarkable resistance against nail penetration in ambient air without failure, smoke, or fire accidents.

         <title>Interelectrode Talk in Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new insight into the cross&#8208;talk behavior between cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode is presented by analyzing the non&#8208;uniform Li+ flux induced electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure. A forward&#8208;looking and overturning opinion on the thorny problem of lithium dendrites is that the initiation factor of lithium&#8208;dendrite growth is the reaction inhomogeneity of the cathode, which can be effectively solved by cathode modification.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries have been identified as a strategic research direction for the electric vehicle industry because of their promising high energy density and potential characteristic safety. However, the intrinsic mechanical properties of solid materials cause inevitable electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure of electrodes and electrolytes during charging and discharging; these failure mechanisms include lithium penetration and formation of cracks and voids, which pose a serious challenge for the long cycle life of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a short overview of the recent advances with a view to understand this challenge is provided. Furthermore, new insights into the cross&#8208;talk behavior between the cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode are provided based on the non&#8208;uniform Li+ flux inducing interactional electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure.

&lt;p&gt;A new insight into the cross-talk behavior between cathode and lithium-metal anode is presented by analyzing the non-uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux induced electro-chemo-mechanical failure. A forward-looking and overturning opinion on the thorny problem of lithium dendrites is that the initiation factor of lithium-dendrite growth is the reaction inhomogeneity of the cathode, which can be effectively solved by cathode modification.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium-metal batteries have been identified as a strategic research direction for the electric vehicle industry because of their promising high energy density and potential characteristic safety. However, the intrinsic mechanical properties of solid materials cause inevitable electro-chemo-mechanical failure of electrodes and electrolytes during charging and discharging; these failure mechanisms include lithium penetration and formation of cracks and voids, which pose a serious challenge for the long cycle life of solid-state lithium-metal batteries. Here, a short overview of the recent advances with a view to understand this challenge is provided. Furthermore, new insights into the cross-talk behavior between the cathode and lithium-metal anode are provided based on the non-uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux inducing interactional electro-chemo-mechanical failure. Furthermore, guidelines for designing stable solid-state lithium-metal batteries and research directions to figure out the interelectrode-talk-related electro-chemo-mechanical failure mechanism are presented, which can be significant for accelerating the development of solid-state lithium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferroelectric Switching at Symmetry&#8208;Broken Interfaces by Local Control of Dislocations Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric stacking order domains are observed in marginally twisted WS2. Using a scanning tunnelling microscope, reversible, local control of the domain walls is demonstrated at room temperature, and their evolution is understood with a theoretical model.








Abstract
Semiconducting ferroelectric materials with low energy polarization switching offer a platform for next&#8208;generation electronics such as ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors. Recently discovered interfacial ferroelectricity in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide films provides an opportunity to combine the potential of semiconducting ferroelectrics with the design flexibility of 2D material devices. Here, local control of ferroelectric domains in a marginally twisted WS2 bilayer is demonstrated with a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature, and their observed reversible evolution is understood using a string&#8208;like model of the domain wall network (DWN). Two characteristic regimes of DWN evolution are identified: (i) elastic bending of partial screw dislocations separating smaller domains with twin stackings due to mutual sliding of monolayers at domain boundaries and (ii) merging of primary domain walls into perfect screw dislocations, which become the seeds for the recovery of the initial domain structure upon reversing electric field. These results open the possibility to achieve full control over atomically thin semiconducting ferroelectric domains using local electric fields, which is a critical step towards their technological use.

         <title>Carbon Additive Manufacturing with a Near&#8208;Replica &#8220;Green&#8208;to&#8208;Brown&#8221; Transformation</title>

         <dc:description>
A composite architected mesoscale process (CAMP) process is reported to manufacture composites with a near&#8208;replica &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation, that features a low volume shrinking (9.98%) during &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation. The CAMP manufactures carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/epoxy with a CNTs loading of 25&#160;wt% exhibiting a longitudinal compressive strength of 381 &#177; 30&#160;MPa.








Abstract
Nanocomposites containing nanoscale materials offer exciting opportunities to encode nanoscale features into macroscale dimensions, which produces unprecedented impact in material design and application. However,&#160;conventional methods cannot process nanocomposites with a high particle loading, as well as nanocomposites with the ability to be tailored at multiple scales. A&#160;composite architected mesoscale process strategy that brings particle loading nanoscale materials combined with multiscale features including nanoscale manipulation, mesoscale architecture, and macroscale formation to create spatially programmed nanocomposites with high particle loading and multiscale tailorability is reported. The process features a low&#8208;shrinking (&lt;10%) &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation, making a near&#8208;geometric replica of the 3D design to produce a &#8220;brown&#8221; part with full nanomaterials to allow further matrix infill. This demonstration includes additively manufactured carbon nanocomposites containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and thermoset epoxy, leading to multiscale CNTs tailorability, performance improvement, and 3D complex geometry feasibility. The&#160;process can produce nanomaterial&#8208;assembled architectures with 3D geometry and multiscale features and can incorporate a wide range of matrix materials, such as polymers, metals, and ceramics, to fabricate nanocomposites for new device structures and applications.

         <title>Curved Nanographenes: Multiple Emission, Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence, and Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual photophysics of a class of curved chiral nanographenes (CNG) consisting of a corannulene and a tert&#8208;butylhexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene is investigated by time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent spectroscopy. Dual fluorescence and dual phosphorescence are found, as well as non&#8208;Kasha emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in a narrow temperature range. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide detailed understanding of the experimental findings.








Abstract
The intriguing and rich photophysical properties of three curved nanographenes (CNG 6, 7, and 8) are investigated by time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. CNG 7 and 8 exhibit dual fluorescence, as well as dual phosphorescence at low temperature in the main PL bands. In addition, hot bands are detected in fluorescence as well as phosphorescence, and, in the narrow temperature range of 100&#8211;140 K, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with lifetimes on the millisecond time&#8208;scale is observed. These findings are rationalized by quantum&#8208;chemical simulations, which predict a single minimum of the S1 potential of CNG 6, but two S1 minima for CNG 7 and CNG 8, with considerable geometric reorganization between them, in agreement with the experimental findings. Additionally, a higher&#8208;lying S2 minimum close to S1 is optimized for the three CNG, from where emission is also possible due to thermal activation and, hence, non&#8208;Kasha behavior. The presence of higher&#8208;lying dark triplet states close to the S1 minima provides mechanistic evidence for the TADF phenomena observed. Non&#8208;radiative decay of the T1 state appears to be thermally activated with activation energies of roughly 100&#160;meV and leads to disappearance of phosphorescence and TADF at T&#160;&gt;&#160;140&#160;K.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal Film on Graphene for Percolation&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Limited Thermal Emissivity Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au atoms tend to form a thin, crystalline layer on graphene surfaces via van der Waals epitaxy, resulting in translucent, conductive films. Translucent yet reflective Au/graphene hybrids are invisible to the naked eye but can be clearly identified at IR wavelength. Au/graphene hybrids can be applied to a wide range of thermal management applications ranging from energy harvesting and storage to military applications.








Abstract
Translucent Au/graphene hybrid films are shown to be effective in reducing thermal emission from the underlying surfaces when the deposition thickness of Au is close to the percolation threshold. The critical Au deposition thickness for an abrupt change in emissivity is reduced from 15&#160;nm (Si substrate) to a percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited thickness of 8.5&#160;nm (graphene/Si substrate) because of the chemical inertness of graphene leading to the deposited Au atoms forming a thin, crystalline layer. The effect of the graphene layer on the optical properties of the hybrid film is highlighted by a drastic increase in infrared absorptivity, whereas the visible absorptivity is marginally affected by the presence of a graphene layer. The level of thermal emission from the Au/graphene hybrid films with the percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited Au thickness is stable even with high background temperatures of up to 300 &#176;C and mechanical strains of &#8776;4%. As an example of a thermal management application, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting device is demonstrated; thermal&#8208;camouflage&#8208;masked text fabricated with an Au/graphene hybrid film is discernible only using a thermographic camera. Ultrathin metal film assisted by a graphene layer will provide a facile platform for thermal management with semi&#8208;transparency, flexibility, and transferability to arbitrary surfaces.

         <title>Inducing Single Spin&#8208;Polarized Flat Bands in Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several years of research have demonstrated that graphene is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;gen electronics. In this regard, the capability of rendering it spin&#8208;polarized opens up the doors of the spintronic field. In this work, it is demonstrated that single spin&#8208;polarized bands are formed near the Fermi level by interfacing a graphene layer grown on a cobalt film with europium.








Abstract
Due to the fundamental and technological implications in driving the appearance of non&#8208;trivial, exotic topological spin textures and emerging symmetry&#8208;broken phases, flat electronic bands in 2D materials, including graphene, are nowadays a relevant topic in the field of spintronics. Here, via europium doping, single spin&#8208;polarized bands are generated in monolayer graphene supported by the Co(0001) surface. The doping is controlled by Eu positioning, allowing for the formation of a K&#175;$\bar{\mathrm{K}}$&#8208;valley localized single spin&#8208;polarized low&#8208;dispersive parabolic band close to the Fermi energy when Eu is on top, and of a &#960;* flat band with single spin&#160;character when Eu is intercalated underneath graphene. In the latter case, Eu also induces a bandgap opening at the Dirac point while the Eu 4f states act as a spin filter, splitting the &#960; band into two spin&#8208;polarized branches. The generation of flat bands with single spin character, as revealed by the spin&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, opens up new pathways toward the realization of spintronic devices exploiting such novel exotic electronic and magnetic states.

         <title>A Rapid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing with Hydrophilic Fractal Microchannels to Promote Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel with hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels by a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process is prepared, realizing &#8776;30 times enhancement in draining water than pure hydrogel. The rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing can accelerate burn wound healing by reducing dermal cavity (&#8776;42.5%), accelerating hair follicles (&#8776;13.5 times) and blood vessels (&#8776;6.6 times) regeneration.








Abstract
Burn wounds pose great challenges for conventional dressings because massive exudates oversecreted from swollen tissues and blisters seriously delay wound healing. Herein, a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing with hydrophilic fractal microchannels is reported that can rapidly drain excessive exudates with &#8776;30 times enhancement in efficiency compared with the pure hydrogel, and effectively promote burn wound healing. A creaming&#8208;assistant emulsion interfacial polymerization approach is proposed to create the hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels in the self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel through a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process of organogel precursor droplets. In a murine burn wound model, the rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressings can markedly reduce dermal cavity by &#8776;42.5%, accelerate blood vessel regeneration by &#8776;6.6 times, and hair follicle regeneration by &#8776;13.5 times, compared with the commercial dressing (Tegaderm). This study paves an avenue for designing high&#8208;performance functional burn wound dressings.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;Derived Outer&#8208;Membrane Vesicles Hitchhike Neutrophils to Enhance Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform based on bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle is developed for enhanced brain delivery of pioglitazone. It can be specifically recognized by neutrophils during blood circulation, subsequently hitchhiking on the neutrophils to cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier. The transcription factors Pou2f1 and Nrf1 of oligodendrocytes are identified for the first time to be involved in neural repair.








Abstract
The treatment of reperfusion injury after ischemic stroke remains unsatisfactory since the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) prevents most neuroprotective agents from entering the brain. Here, a strategy is proposed based on bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (OMV) hitchhiking on the neutrophils for enhanced brain delivery of pioglitazone (PGZ) to treat ischemic stroke. By encapsulating PGZ into OMV, the resulting OMV@PGZ nanoparticles inherit the functions associated with the bacterial outer membrane, making them ideal decoys for neutrophil uptake. The results show that OMV@PGZ simultaneously inhibits the activation of nucleotide oligomerization&#8208;like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)&#160;inflammasomes and ferroptosis and reduces the reperfusion injury to exert a neuroprotective effect. Notably, the transcription factors Pou2f1 and Nrf1 of oligodendrocytes are identified for the first time to be involved in this process and promoted neural repair by single&#8208;nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA&#8208;seq).

         <title>Tunable Organic Active Neural Probe Enabling Near&#8208;Sensor Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifier is monolithically integrated with organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a highly flexible substrate. The active neural probe records local field potentials in an experimental rat model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This approach creates a new near&#8208;sensor processing paradigm in neural interface technology.








Abstract
Neural recording systems have significantly progressed to provide an advanced understanding and treatment for neurological diseases. Flexible transistor&#8208;based active neural probes exhibit great potential in electrophysiology applications due to their intrinsic amplification capability and tissue&#8208;compliant nature. However, most current active neural probes exhibit bulky back&#8208;end connectivity since the output is current, and the development of an integrated circuit for voltage output is crucial for near&#8208;sensor signal processing at the abiotic/biotic interface. Here, inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifiers are presented by monolithically integrating organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a single, highly flexible substrate for in vivo brain activity recording. Additive inkjet printing enables the seamless integration of multiple active and passive components on the somatosensory cortex, leading to significant noise reduction over the externally connected typical configuration. It also facilitates fine&#8208;tuning of the voltage amplification and frequency properties. The organic voltage amplifiers are validated as electrocorticography devices in a rat in vivo model, showing their ability to record local field potentials in an experimental model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity. These results bring organic active neural probes to the forefront in applications where efficient sensory data processing is performed at sensor endpoints.

         <title>Enhanced Hot&#8208;Phonon Bottleneck Effect on Slowing Hot Carrier Cooling in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots with Alloyed A&#8208;Site</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controversies regarding the origins and mechanisms of A&#8208;site cation&#8208;dependent hot carrier relaxation dynamics are resolved by comparing the photogenerated carrier dynamics of 6 kinds of pure and mixed A&#8208;site cation halide perovskite quantum dots (i.e., FAPbI3, MAPbI3, CsPbI3, FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 PQDs) at various excitation intensities.








Abstract
A deep understanding of the effect of the A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange on the hot&#8208;carrier relaxation dynamics in perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) has profound implications on the further development of disruptive photovoltaic technologies. In this study, the hot carrier cooling kinetics of pure FAPbI3 (FA+, CH(NH2)2+),&#160;MAPbI3 (MA+, CH3NH3++), CsPbI3 (Cs+, Cesium) and alloyed FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, and MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 QDs are investigated using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy.

     alt="Enhanced Hot-Phonon Bottleneck Effect on Slowing Hot Carrier Cooling in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots with Alloyed A-Site"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversies regarding the origins and mechanisms of A-site cation-dependent hot carrier relaxation dynamics are resolved by comparing the photogenerated carrier dynamics of 6 kinds of pure and mixed A-site cation halide perovskite quantum dots (i.e., FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, FA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, FA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs) at various excitation intensities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep understanding of the effect of the A-site cation cross-exchange on the hot-carrier relaxation dynamics in perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) has profound implications on the further development of disruptive photovoltaic technologies. In this study, the hot carrier cooling kinetics of pure FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;),&#160;MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (MA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;), CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cesium) and alloyed FA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, FA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs are investigated using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy.

         <title>Magnetically Actuated Fiber&#8208;Based Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D magnetic soft robots are demonstrated through a combination of photocurable magnetic elastomer design and fiber&#8208;based fabrication of helical actuators. Fiber&#8208;based robots are engineered for crawling and walking motion under unidirectional fields applied via stationary electromagnets. The versatile design and straightforward control pave the way for applications of magnetic fiber&#8208;based robots in spatially constrained environments.








Abstract
Broad adoption of magnetic soft robotics is hampered by the sophisticated field paradigms for their manipulation and the complexities in controlling multiple devices. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput fabrication of such devices across spatial scales remains challenging. Here, advances in fiber&#8208;based actuators and magnetic elastomer composites are leveraged to create 3D magnetic soft robots controlled by unidirectional fields. Thermally drawn elastomeric fibers are instrumented with a magnetic composite synthesized to withstand strains exceeding 600%. A combination of strain and magnetization engineering in these fibers enables programming of 3D robots capable of crawling or walking in magnetic fields orthogonal to the plane of motion. Magnetic robots act as cargo carriers, and multiple robots can be controlled simultaneously and in opposing directions using a single stationary electromagnet. The scalable approach to fabrication and control of magnetic soft robots invites their future applications in constrained environments where complex fields cannot be readily deployed.

         <title>Manipulation of Charge Dynamics for Efficient and Bright Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Chiral Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the charge dynamics through a novel chiral organic cation passivator and a ladder&#8208;like energy architecture, blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.15%, a luminance of 8170&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 with stable emissions, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) emerge as a promising class of optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation displays and lighting technology. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs lags far behind that of their green and red counterparts, including the unachieved trade&#8208;off between high efficiency and high luminance, severe efficiency roll&#8208;off, and unsatisfactory power efficiency. Here, a multi&#8208;functional chiral ligand of L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride is strategically introduced into quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which can effectively passivate defects, modulate the phase distribution, improve photoluminescence quantum yield, guarantee high&#8208;quality film morphology, and enhance charge transport. Furthermore, ladder&#8208;like hole transport layers are established, boosting charge injection and balance. The resultant sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (the photoluminescence peak is 493&#160;nm and the electroluminescence peak is 497&#160;nm) exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 12.43% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Molecular One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Qubit Systems with Very Long Coherence Times</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very long coherence times of up to 140 &#181;s are reported in perchlorotriphenylmethyl mono&#8208; and diradicals, strongly exceeding previous values. Furthermore, two&#8208;spin coherent manipulations are reported in the biradical systems, as a basic quantum gate operation. These results demonstrate the suitability of these compounds for molecular quantum architectures.








Abstract
General&#8208;purpose quantum computation and quantum simulation require multi&#8208;qubit architectures with precisely defined, robust interqubit interactions, coupled with local addressability. This is an unsolved challenge, primarily due to scalability issues. These issues often derive from poor control over interqubit interactions. Molecular systems are promising materials for the realization of large&#8208;scale quantum architectures, due to their high degree of positionability and the possibility to precisely tailor interqubit interactions. The simplest quantum architecture is the two&#8208;qubit system, with which quantum gate operations can be implemented. To be viable, a two&#8208;qubit system must possess long coherence times, the interqubit interaction must be well defined and the two qubits must also be addressable individually within the same quantum manipulation sequence. Here results are presented on the investigation of the spin dynamics of chlorinated triphenylmethyl organic radicals, in particular the perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical, a mono&#8208;functionalized PTM, and a biradical PTM dimer. Extraordinarily long ensemble coherence times up to 148 &#181;s are found at all temperatures below 100&#160;K. Two&#8208;qubit and, importantly, individual qubit addressability in the biradical system are demonstrated. These results underline the potential of molecular materials for the development of quantum architectures.

         <title>Robust PANI@MXene/GQDs&#8208;Based Fiber Fabric Electrodes via Microfluidic Wet&#8208;Fusing Spinning Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient microfluidic wet&#8208;fusing spinning chemistry (MWSC) method and in&#8208;situ growth process is developed to continuously fabricate high electrochemical performance and high mechanical strength MXene&#8208;based fiber fabrics (MFFs) with hierarchical architecture. This strategy has directive significance to the large&#8208;scale preparation of conductive fabric electrodes and provides a viable solution for the increasing demand of the portable microelectronic energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) as a promising candidate material for batteries and supercapacitors has shown excellent electrochemical performance, but it is difficult to meet practical applications because of its poor morphology structure, low mechanical properties, and expensive process. Here, an applied and efficient method based on microfluidic wet&#8208;fusing spinning chemistry (MWSC) is proposed to construct hierarchical structure of MXene&#8208;based fiber fabrics (MFFs), allowing the availability of MFF electrodes with ultrastrong toughness, high conductivity, and easily machinable properties. First, a dot&#8208;sheet structure constructed by graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and MXene nanosheets with multianchor interaction in the microchannel of a microfluidic device enhances the mechanical strength of MXene fibers; next, the interfused fiber network structure of Ti3C2Tx/GQDs fabrics assembled by the MWSC process enhances the deformability of the whole fabrics; finally, the core&#8211;shell structure of PANI@Ti3C2Tx/GQDs architected by in&#8208;situ polymerization growth of polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers provides more ion&#8208;accessible pathways and sites for kinetic migration and ion accumulation. Through the morphology and microstructure design, this strategy has directive significance to the large&#8208;scale preparation of conductive fabric electrodes and provides a viable solution for simultaneously enhancing mechanical strength and electrochemical performance of conductive fabric electrodes.

This strategy has directive significance to the large-scale preparation of conductive fabric electrodes and provides a viable solution for the increasing demand of the portable microelectronic energy-storage devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional transition metal titanium carbide (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) as a promising candidate material for batteries and supercapacitors has shown excellent electrochemical performance, but it is difficult to meet practical applications because of its poor morphology structure, low mechanical properties, and expensive process. Here, an applied and efficient method based on microfluidic wet-fusing spinning chemistry (MWSC) is proposed to construct hierarchical structure of MXene-based fiber fabrics (MFFs), allowing the availability of MFF electrodes with ultrastrong toughness, high conductivity, and easily machinable properties. First, a dot-sheet structure constructed by graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and MXene nanosheets with multianchor interaction in the microchannel of a microfluidic device enhances the mechanical strength of MXene fibers; next, the interfused fiber network structure of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/GQDs fabrics assembled by the MWSC process enhances the deformability of the whole fabrics; finally, the core&#8211;shell structure of PANI@Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/GQDs architected by in-situ polymerization growth of polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers provides more ion-accessible pathways and sites for kinetic migration and ion accumulation. Through the morphology and microstructure design, this strategy has directive significance to the large-scale preparation of conductive fabric electrodes and provides a viable solution for simultaneously enhancing mechanical strength and electrochemical performance of conductive fabric electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Ferroionics: Conductive Switching Mechanisms and Transition Boundaries in Van der Waals Layered Material CuInP2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full 2D van der Waals heterostructure ferroelectric semimetal junction is fabricated to unravel the conductive mechanism of CuInP2S6, and a detailed phase diagram of the competing mechanisms and transition boundaries with temperature and an external electric field is presented. Based on this understanding, an artificial synapse with automatic gain control is also demonstrated.








Abstract
The recently unfolded ferroionic phenomena in 2D van der Waals (vdW) copper&#8211;indium&#8211;thiophosphate (CuInP2S6 or CIPS) have received widespread interest as they allow for dynamic control of conductive switching properties, which are appealing in the paradigm&#8208;shift computing. The intricate couplings between ferroelectric polarization and ionic conduction in 2D vdW CIPS facilitate the manipulation and dynamic control of conductive behaviors. However, the complex interplays and underlying mechanisms are not yet fully explored and understood. Here, by investigating polarization switching and ionic conduction in the temperature and applied electric field domains, it is discovered that the conducting mechanisms of CIPS can be divided into four distinctive states (or modes) with transitional boundaries, depending on the dynamics of Cu ions in the material. Further, it demonstrates that dynamically&#8208;tunable synaptic responsive behavior can be well implemented by governing the working&#8208;state transition. This research provides an in&#8208;depth, quantitative understanding of the complex phenomena of conductive switching in 2D vdW CIPS with coexisting ferroelectric order and ionic disorder. The developed insights in this work lay the ground for implementing high&#8208;performance, function&#8208;enriched devices for information processing, data storage, and neuromorphic computing based on the 2D ferroionic material systems.

         <title>Direct&#8208;Current Electrical Detection of Surface&#8208;Acoustic&#8208;Wave&#8208;Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrical detection technique is developed for the magneto&#8208;elastic effective field of surface acoustic wave (SAW), showing advantages of better integration compatibility and lower cost than traditional techniques like vector network analyzer. It is made possible by the direct current rectification effect of the SAW&#8208;driven ferromagnetic resonance, paving the way for designable spin acousto&#8208;electronic devices with convenient signal readout.








Abstract
Surface acoustic waves (SAW) provide a promising platform to study spin&#8208;phonon coupling, which can be achieved by SAW&#8208;driven ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) for efficient acoustic manipulation of spin. Although the magneto&#8208;elastic effective field model has achieved great success in describing SAW&#8208;driven FMR, the magnitude of the effective field acting on the magnetization induced by SAW still remains hard to access. Here, by integrating ferromagnetic stripes with SAW devices, direct&#8208;current detection for SAW&#8208;driven FMR based on electrical rectification is reported. By analyzing FMR rectified voltage, the effective fields are straightforwardly characterized and extracted, which exhibits&#160;the advantages of better integration compatibility and lower cost than traditional methods such as vector&#8208;network analyzer&#8208;based techniques. A large nonreciprocal rectified voltage is obtained, which is attributed to the coexistence of in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane effective fields. The effective fields can be modulated by controlling the longitudinal and shear strains within the films to achieve almost 100% nonreciprocity ratio, demonstrating the potential for electrical switches. Besides its fundamental significance, this finding provides a unique opportunity for a designable spin acousto&#8208;electronic device and its convenient signal readout.

         <title>Precision Covalent Organic Frameworks for Surface Nucleation Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanometer&#8208;thick amphiphobic coating using covalent organic frameworks is shown to suppress the nucleation of calcium carbonate and ice crystals through nanoconfinement. The fluorine&#8208;free coating features excellent transparency and resistance to high&#8208;speed jets of water and organic solvents.








Abstract
Unwanted accumulation of ice and lime scale crystals on surfaces is a long&#8208;standing challenge with major economic and sustainability implications. Passive inhibition of icing and scaling by liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces are often inadequate, susceptible to surface failure under harsh conditions, and unsuitable for long&#8208;term/real&#8208;life usages. Such surfaces often require a multiplicity of additional features such as optical transparency, robust impact resistance, and ability to prevent contamination from low surface energy liquids. Unfortunately, most promising advances have relied on using perfluoro compounds, which are bio&#8208;persistent and/or highly toxic. Here it is&#160;shown that organic, reticular mesoporous structures, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), may offer a solution. By exploiting simple and scalable synthesis of defect&#8208;free COFs and rational post&#8208;synthetic functionalization, nanocoatings with precision nanoporosity (morphology) are prepared that can inhibit nucleation at the molecular level without compromising the related contamination prevention and robustness. The results offer a simple strategy to exploit the nanoconfinement effect, which remarkably delays the nucleation of ice and scale formation on surfaces. Ice nucleation is suppressed down to &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C, scale formation is avoided for &gt;2&#160;weeks in supersaturated conditions, and jets of organic solvents impacting at Weber numbers &gt;105 are resisted with surfaces that also offer optical transparency (&gt;92%).

         <title>Meta&#8208;Aerogel Ion Motor for Nanofluid Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic meta&#8208;aerogel ion motors with actuatable &#8220;ion&#8208;express highways&#8221; are fabricated for blue energy harvesting. The nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogels exhibit space&#8208;confined selective ion transport at the sub&#8208;nanometer level, which can produce an excellent output power density of over 30&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 on mixing the natural seawater and river water, and power the devices including the ship model and home&#8208;made maritime safety warning system.








Abstract
Osmotic power, also known as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is a vast, sustainable, and clean energy source that can be directly converted into electricity by nanofluidic membranes. However, the key technological bottleneck for large&#8208;scale osmotic electricity is that macroscopic&#8208;scale bulky membrane cannot synergistically satisfy the demands of high power density and low resistance without sacrificing scalability and mechanical robustness. Here, inspired by the anatomy and working principle of electric eels, which harness osmotic energy through embedded neuron&#8208;mediated fibril nanochannels with nanoconfined transport dynamics. Fibrous nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogel ion motors, 3D&#8208;assembled from nanofluidic cable fibers with actuatable stimulation/transport &#8220;ion highways&#8221; are engineered. The meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits the integrated coupling effect of boosted ion propulsion and surface&#8208;charge&#8208;dominated selective ion transport. Driven by osmosis, the meta&#8208;aerogel ion motor can produce an unprecedented output power density of up to 30.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient. Advancing ultra&#8208;selective ion transport in nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogels may provide a promising roadmap for blue energy harvesting.

         <title>Quantitative Mapping of Chemical Defects at Charged Grain Boundaries in a Ferroelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties and chemical composition at grain boundaries in ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals are studied. Atom probe tomography shows that the chemical structure at grain boundaries is substantially different from the bulk, revealing the microscopic origin of their distinct electronic responses. The work demonstrates the benefit of quantitative atomic&#8208;scale measurements and additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.








Abstract
Polar discontinuities, as well as compositional and structural changes at oxide interfaces can give rise to a large variety of electronic and ionic phenomena. In contrast to earlier work focused on domain walls and epitaxial systems, this work investigates the relation between polar discontinuities and the local chemistry at grain boundaries in polycrystalline ferroelectric ErMnO3. Using orientation mapping and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, the polycrystalline material is demonstrated to develop charged grain boundaries with enhanced electronic conductance. By performing atom probe tomography (APT) measurements, an enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at all grain boundaries are found. The observed compositional changes translate into a charge that exceeds possible polarization&#8208;driven effects, demonstrating that structural phenomena rather than electrostatics determine the local chemical composition and related changes in the electronic transport behavior. The study shows that the charged grain boundaries behave distinctly different from charged domain walls, giving additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.

         <title>An Exciplex&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emission Pathway for Solution&#8208;State Electrochemiluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical generation of exciplex states improves the efficiency and robustness of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in solution. Mesoporous TiO2 electrodes increase the contact area and further enhance ECL. A solution&#8208;state ECL device combining both principles reaches a high luminance of 3790&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and offers a 30&#8208;fold improvement in operational lifetime.








Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) allows the design of unique light&#8208;emitting devices that use organic semiconductors in a liquid or gel state, which allows for simpler and more sustainable device fabrication and facilitates unconventional device form&#8208;factors. Compared to solid&#8208;state organic LEDs, ECL devices (ECLDs) have attracted less attention due to their currently much lower performance. ECLD operation is typically based on an annihilation pathway that involves electron transfer between reduced and oxidized luminophore species; the intermediate radical ions produced during annihilation dramatically reduce device stability. Here, the effects of radical ions are mitigated by an exciplex formation pathway and a remarkable improvement in luminance, luminous efficacy, and operational lifetime is demonstrated. Electron donor and acceptor molecules are dissolved at high concentrations and recombined as an exciplex upon their oxidization/reduction. The exciplex then transfers its energy to a nearby dye, allowing the dye to emit light without undergoing oxidation/reduction. Furthermore, the application of a mesoporous TiO2 electrode increases the contact area and hence the number of molecules participating in ECL , thereby obtaining devices with a very high luminance of 3790&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a 30&#8208;fold improved operational lifetime. This study paves the way for the development of ECLDs into highly versatile light sources.

         <title>Inhalable Capsular Polysaccharide&#8208;Camouflaged Gallium&#8208;Polyphenol Nanoparticles Enhance Lung Cancer Chemotherapy by Depleting Local Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inhalable capsular polysaccharide (CP)&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic network (MON) is designed here to abrogate bacteria&#8208;induced drug resistance. In multiple lung cancer mice models, inhaled MON shows uniform biodistribution and long&#8208;term retention within lung tissues, and Ga3+ releases effectively disrupted bacterial iron respiration to deplete lung microbiota for enhanced lung cancer chemotherapy.








Abstract
Local lung microbiota is closely associated with lung tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. It is found that lung commensal microbes induce chemoresistance in lung cancer by directly inactivating therapeutic drugs via biotransformation. Accordingly, an inhalable microbial capsular polysaccharide (CP)&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;polyphenol metal&#8211;organic network (MON) is designed to eliminate lung microbiota and thereby abrogate microbe&#8208;induced chemoresistance. As a substitute for iron uptake, Ga3+ released from MON acts as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; to disrupt bacterial iron respiration, effectively inactivating multiple microbes. Moreover, CP cloaks endow MON with reduced immune clearance by masquerading as normal host&#8208;tissue molecules, significantly increasing residence time in lung tissue for enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. In multiple lung cancer mice models, microbe&#8208;induced drug degradation is remarkably inhibited when drugs are delivered by antimicrobial MON. Tumor growth is sufficiently suppressed and mouse survival is prolonged. The&#160;work develops a novel microbiota&#8208;depleted nanostrategy to overcome chemoresistance in lung cancer by inhibiting local microbial inactivation of therapeutic drugs.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Null Exciton&#8208;Coupled Diketopyrrolopyrroles Oligo&#8208;Grids</title>

         <dc:description>
Covalent diketopyrrolopyrrole dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid with cyclic rigid structures are synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. They both display null exciton couplings and solvent&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics. In toluene, they exhibit monomer&#8208;like photophysical properties. However, in benzonitrile, especially [2]Grid forms the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state faster and more efficiently, which further recombines to generate the triplet excited state.








Abstract
Exciton coupling in molecular aggregates plays a vital role in impacting and fine&#8208;tuning optoelectronic materials and their efficiencies in devices. A versatile platform to decipher aggregation&#8208;property relationships is built around multichromophoric architectures. Here, a series of cyclic diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) oligomers featuring nanoscale gridarene structures and rigid bifluorenyl spacers are designed and synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. DPP dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid, which are cyclic rigid nanoarchitectures of rather different sizes, are further characterized via steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. They exhibit monomer&#8208;like spectroscopic signatures in the steady&#8208;state measurements, from which null exciton couplings are derived. Moreover, in an apolar solvent, high fluorescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state dynamics that resembled DPP monomer are gathered. In a polar solvent, the localized singlet excited state on a single DPP dissociates into the adjacent null coupling DPP with charge transfer characteristics. This pathway facilitates the evolution of&#160;the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state (SB&#8208;CS). Notable is the fact that the SB&#8208;CS of [2]Grid is, on one hand, in equilibrium with the singlet excited state and promotes, on the other hand, the formation of the triplet excited state with a yield of 32% via charge recombination.

         <title>Homogeneous Phase Distribution in Q&#8208;2D Perovskites via Co&#8208;Assembly of Spacer Cations for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spacer cations are tailored by adjusting the chain length and steric hindrance, which is proved to systematically affect the assembling of low&#8208;n phase perovskite via in situ absorption measurement. Homogeneous phase distribution is achieved through incorporating TPMA+, which restricts the stacking of PEA+ and eliminates the nucleation of the low&#8208;n phase, achieving the highest EQE of 23.9% for green PeLED.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising candidates to apply in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, delicate control on crystallization kinetics is needed to suppress severe phase segregation.

&lt;p&gt;The spacer cations are tailored by adjusting the chain length and steric hindrance, which is proved to systematically affect the assembling of low-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; phase perovskite via in situ absorption measurement. Homogeneous phase distribution is achieved through incorporating TPMA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which restricts the stacking of PEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and eliminates the nucleation of the low-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; phase, achieving the highest EQE of 23.9% for green PeLED.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-2D (Q-2D) perovskites are promising candidates to apply in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, delicate control on crystallization kinetics is needed to suppress severe phase segregation. Here, the crystallization kinetics of Q-2D perovskites are investigated via in situ absorbance spectroscopy and for the first time find the multiphase distribution is governed by the arrangement, rather than diffusion, of spacer cations at the nucleation stage, which associate with its assembling ability determined by molecular configuration. A &#8220;co-assembly&#8221; strategy is conceived by combining co-cations with different configuration characteristics, where bulky cations disturb the assembling between slender cations and lead&#8211;bromide sheet, contributing to homogeneous emitting phase with effective passivation. Correspondingly, in the phenylethylammonium (PEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-based Q-2D perovskites (&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;&#160;=&#160;3), homogeneous phase distribution is achieved by incorporating co-cation triphenylmethaneammonium (TPMA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the branching terminals of which suppress cations assembling into low-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; phases and afford adequate cations as passivating ligands. Therefore, the champion external quantum efficiency of the LED device reaches 23.9%, which is among the highest performance of green Q-2D perovskite LEDs. This work reveals that the arrangement of spacer cations determines the crystallization kinetics in Q-2D perovskites, providing further guidance on the molecular design and phase modulation of Q-2D perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Color Mixing in Microcapsules through Exclusive Crystallization of Binary and Ternary Colloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic microcapsules with dual or triple stopbands are created by exclusively crystallizing binary or ternary colloids in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. The controlled depletion attraction induces homogeneous particle association to produce distinct crystalline grains, preventing glassy alloy formation. The resulting microcapsules exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors that can be controlled through the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals are designed as photonic microparticles for various applications. However, conventional microparticles generally have only one stopband from a single lattice constant, which restricts the range of colors and optical codes available. Here, photonic microcapsules are created that contain two or three distinct crystalline grains, resulting in dual or triple stopbands that offer a wider range of colors through structural color mixing. To produce distinct colloidal crystallites from binary or ternary colloidal mixtures, the interparticle interaction is manipulated using depletion forces in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. Aqueous dispersions of binary or ternary colloidal mixtures in the innermost droplet are gently concentrated in the presence of a depletant and salt by imposing hypertonic conditions. Different&#8208;sized particles crystallize into their own crystals rather than forming random glassy alloys to minimize free energy. The average size of the crystalline grains can be adjusted with osmotic pressure, and the relative ratio of distinct grains can be controlled with the mixing ratio of particles. The resulting microcapsules with small grains and high surface coverage are almost optically isotropic and exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors and multiple reflectance peaks. The mixed color and reflectance spectrum are controllable with the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.

         <title>A Deformable Additive on Defects Passivation and Phase Segregation Inhibition Enables the Efficiency of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>

A deformable coumarin has been successfully employed to passivate anion/cation defects and release residual stress, endowing that phase segregation can be effectively inhibited. Moreover, the benefit of the larger grain size and less trap&#8208;assisted recombination, yielding an exceptional efficiency of over 24% for rigid inverted perovskite solar cells and an efficiency of over 23% for flexible inverted perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The defects and phase segregation in perovskite will significantly reduce the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a deformable coumarin is employed as a multifunctional additive for formamidinium&#8211;cesium (FA&#8208;Cs) perovskite. During the annealing process of perovskite, the partial decomposition of coumarin passivates the Pb2+, iodine, and organic cation defects. Additionally, coumarin can affect colloidal size distributions, resulting in relatively large grain size and good crystallinity of target perovskite film. Hence, the carrier extraction/transport can be promoted, trap&#8208;assisted recombination is reduced, and energy levels are optimized in target perovskite films. Furthermore, the coumarin treatment can significantly release residual stress. As a result, the champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.18% and 24.14% are obtained for Br&#8208;rich (FA0.88Cs0.12PbI2.64Br0.36) and Br&#8208;poor (FA0.96Cs0.04PbI2.8Br0.12) based devices, respectively. The flexible PSCs based on Br&#8208;poor perovskite exhibit an excellent PCE of 23.13%, one of the highest values for flexible PSCs reported to date. Due to the inhibition of phase segregation, the target devices exhibit excellent thermal and light stability. This work provides new insights into the additive engineering of passivating defects, stress relief, and inhibition of phase segregation of perovskite films, offering a reliable method to develop state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Microscale Imaging of Thermal Conductivity Suppression at Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity imaging via frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance enables the detection of localized microscale suppression in thermal conductivity at the grain boundaries of thermoelectric SnTe. By employing a Gibbs excess approach, a thermal boundary resistance is extracted from the images, establishing a correlation between misorientation angle and thermal resistance. These findings demonstrate the capability of thermal imaging in extracting structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Grain&#8208;boundary engineering is an effective strategy to tune the thermal conductivity of materials, leading to improved performance in thermoelectric, thermal&#8208;barrier coatings, and thermal management applications. Despite the central importance to thermal transport, a clear understanding of how grain boundaries modulate the microscale heat flow is missing, owing to the scarcity of local investigations. Here, thermal imaging of individual grain boundaries is demonstrated in thermoelectric SnTe via spatially resolved frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance. Measurements with microscale resolution reveal local suppressions in thermal conductivity at grain boundaries. Also, the grain&#8208;boundary thermal resistance &#8211; extracted by employing a Gibbs excess approach &#8211; is found to be correlated with the grain&#8208;boundary misorientation angle. Extracting thermal properties, including thermal boundary resistances, from microscale imaging can provide comprehensive understanding of how microstructure affects heat transport, crucially impacting the materials design of high&#8208;performance thermal&#8208;management and energy&#8208;conversion devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Modulation with Covalent Organic Framework Enables Efficient and Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;interface modulation strategy is demonstrated using functional covalent organic frameworks to fabricate the high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells; a champion efficiency of 24.26% is obtained together with enhanced long&#8208;term stability due to released tensile stress, reduced trap state density, as well as enhanced resistance of humidity and ultraviolet irradiation.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;interface modulation including buried interface as well as the top surface has recently been proven to be crucial for obtaining high photovoltaic performance in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time, the strategy of using functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely HS&#8208;COFs for dual&#8208;interface modulation, is reported to further understand its intrinsic mechanisms in optimizing the bottom and top surfaces. Specifically, the buried HS&#8208;COFs layer can enhance the resistance against ultraviolet radiation, and more importantly, release the tensile strain, which is beneficial for enhancing device stability and improving the order of perovskite crystal growth. Furthermore, the detailed characterization results reveal that the HS&#8208;COFs on the top surface can effectively passivate the surface defects and suppress non&#8208;radiation recombination, as well as optimize the crystallization and growth of the perovskite film. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the dual&#8208;interface modified devices deliver champion efficiencies of 24.26% and 21.30% for 0.0725 cm2 and 1 cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively. Moreover, they retain 88% and 84% of their initial efficiencies after aging for 2000 h under the ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, relative humidity: 35&#8211;45%) and a nitrogen atmosphere with heating at 65&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the dual-interface modified devices deliver champion efficiencies of 24.26% and 21.30% for 0.0725 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sized devices, respectively. Moreover, they retain 88% and 84% of their initial efficiencies after aging for 2000 h under the ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, relative humidity: 35&#8211;45%) and a nitrogen atmosphere with heating at 65&#160;&#176;C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cancer Stem&#8208;Like Cells&#8208;Oriented Surface Self&#8208;Assembly to&#160;Conquer Radioresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MMP&#8208;2 responsive peptide&#8208;based radiosensitizer is proposed to achieve deep tumor penetration and in situ self&#8208;assemble into functional nanofibers on the surface of hypoxic cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs), which finally induces the hypoxic CSC differentiation and boosts the radiotherapeutic efficiency. This strategy provides a general nanoplatform to conquer CSCs&#8208;mediated radioresistance.








Abstract
Cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs), capable of indefinite self&#8208;renewal and differentiation, are considered to be the root cause of tumor radiotherapy (RT) resistance. However, the CSCs&#8208;targeted therapy still remains to be a great challenge because they are commonly located in the deep tumor making drugs hard to approach, and their hypoxic and acidic niche can further aggravate radioresistance. Herein, based on the finding that hypoxic CSCs highly express carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) on the cell membrane, a CAIX&#8208;targeted induced in situ self&#8208;assembly system on the surface of CSC is reported to overcome hypoxic CSC&#8208;mediated radioresistance. Via the sequential processes of &#8220;monomer release&#8208;target accumulation&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly&#8221;, the constructed peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system (CA&#8208;Pt) exhibits the advantages of deep penetration, amplified CAIX inhibition, and enhanced cellular uptake, which greatly relieves the hypoxic and acidic microenvironment to promote the hypoxic CSC differentiation and combines with platinum to boost the RT&#8208;inducing DNA damage. In both lung cancer tumor mouse and zebrafish embryo models, CA&#8208;Pt treatment can effectively assist RT in suppressing tumor growth and preventing tumor invasion and metastasis. This study uses a surface&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy to differentiate hypoxic CSCs, which may provide a universal treatment strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance.

         <title>Photoelectron &#8220;Bridge&#8221; in Van Der Waals Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterojunctions as photocatalysts by traditional wet chemical methods encounter the challengeof charge transfer, because of steric hindrance and barriers caused by a large interfacial spacing. Introducing phosphoric acid molecules at the heterojunction interface acts as an electron "bridge" to eliminate the interfacial potential difference and create a photoelectron transport channel to promote the photocatalytic reaction.








Abstract
Constructing Van der Waals heterojunction is a crucial strategy to achieve excellent photocatalytic activity. However, in most Van der Waals heterojunctions synthesized by ex situ assembly, electron transfer encounters huge hindrances at the interface between the two components due to the large spacing and potential barrier. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;bridged Van der Waals heterojunction of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/tungsten disulfide (WS2) bridged by phosphate (xCoPc&#8208;nPO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2) is designed and prepared by the traditional wet chemistry method. By introducing a small phosphate molecule into the interface of CoPc and WS2, creates an electron &#8220;bridge&#8221;, resulting in a compact combination and eliminating the space barrier. Therefore, the phosphate (PO4&#8722;) bridge can serve as an efficient electron transfer channel in heterojunction and can efficiently transmit photoelectrons from WS2 to CoPc under excited states. These excited photoelectrons are captured by the catalytic central Co2+ in CoPc and subsequently convert CO2 molecules into CO and CH4 products, achieving&#160;17&#8208;fold enhancement on the 3CoPc&#8208;0.6PO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2 sample compared to that of pure WS2. Introducing a small molecule &#8220;bridge&#8221; to create an electron transfer channel provides a new perspective in designing efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into valuable products.

         <title>PdNi Biatomic Clusters from Metallene Unlock Record&#8208;Low Onset Dehydrogenation Temperature for Bulk&#8208;MgH2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented initial dehydrogenation temperature of bulk MgH2&#8208;PdNi is 422 K, which is lower than the most bulk MgH2&#8208;based composites. PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers are used as the main active sites, which together with Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms in situ enhance the desorption/absorption process.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage has long been a priority on the renewable energy research agenda. Due to its high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen density, MgH2 is a desirable candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. However, its practical use is constrained by high thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. Here, PdNi bilayer metallenes are reported as catalysts for hydrogen storage of bulk&#8208;MgH2 near ambient temperature. Unprecedented 422 K beginning dehydrogenation temperature and up to 6.36&#160;wt.% reliable hydrogen storage capacity are achieved. Fast hydrogen desorption is also provided by the system (5.49&#160;wt.% in 1&#160;h, 523 K). The in situ generated PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers are identified as the main active sites during the de/re&#8208;hydrogenation process by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and theoretical simulations, while other active species including Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms obtained via metallene ball milling, also enhance the reaction. These findings present fundamental insights into active species identification and rational design of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials.

         <title>In situ Electropolymerized 3D Microporous Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Nanofilm for Highly Effective Molecular Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D microporous polymer nanofilms of cobalt(II)&#8208;porphyrin are directly and uniformly deposited on the cathode via thickness&#8208;controlled, green, and catalyst&#8208;free electropolymerization. The films exhibit high activity and durability in electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion mainly due to tightly adhered abundant active sites. This work provides an effective way to fabricate molecular catalysts on electrodes for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) based on molecular catalysts, for example, cobalt porphyrin, is promising to enhance the carbon cycle and mitigate current climate crisis. However, the electrocatalytic performance and accurate evaluations remain problems because of either the low loading amount or the low utilization rate of the electroactive CoN4 sites. Herein a monomer is synthesized, cobalt(II)&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(3,5&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)porphyrin (CoP), electropolymerized onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks, affording a molecular electrocatalyst of 3D microporous nanofilm (EP&#8208;CoP, 2&#8211;3&#160;nm thickness) with highly dispersed CoN4 sites. The new electrocatalyst shortens the electron transfer pathway, accelerates the redox kinetics of CoN4 sites, and improves the durability of the electrocatalytic CO2RR. From the intrinsic redox behavior of CoN4 sites, the effective utilization rate is obtained as 13.1%, much higher than that of the monomer assembled electrode (5.8%), and the durability is also promoted dramatically (&gt;40&#160;h) in H&#8208;type cells. In commercial flow cells, EP&#8208;CoP can achieve a faradic efficiency for CO (FECO) over 92% at an overpotential of 160&#160;mV. At a higher overpotential of 620&#160;mV, the working current density can reach 310&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a high FECO of 98.6%, representing the best performance for electrodeposited molecular porphyrin electrocatalysts.

In commercial flow cells, EP-CoP can achieve a faradic efficiency for CO (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) over 92% at an overpotential of 160&#160;mV. At a higher overpotential of 620&#160;mV, the working current density can reach 310&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a high FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; of 98.6%, representing the best performance for electrodeposited molecular porphyrin electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Amphiphilic Structure of Zwitterionic AIE Photosensitizers to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A philosophy of balanced hydrophobicity&#8211;hydrophilicity is proposed to design aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers for promoting antitumor immunity. A membrane&#8208;targeted AIE photosensitizer called TPS&#8208;2 could induce cell death and membrane rupture by photodynamic therapy. Its aggregate size controllability promotes the release and delivery of antigens to boost in vivo antitumor immunity with only one dose of vaccination.








Abstract
Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) for thorough cancer treatment is hindered by the limited generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with short lifetime from photosensitizers, PDT&#8208;induced antitumor immune response remedies the defects. Previous studies show that inducing immunogenic cell deaths is an attractive approach to activate antitumor immunity, which confers a robust adjuvanticity to dying cancer cells. In this work, amphiphilic luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics (AIEgens) are rationally designed and synthesized. By modulating the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;bridge and zwitterionic functional groups, these AIEgens exhibit tunable organelle specificity to lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane and enhance ROS generation ability. Notably, the membrane&#8208;targeting AIEgen namely TPS&#8208;2 induces cell death and membrane rupture via PDT to facilitate the release of antigens and activation of immune cells. Furthermore, the size&#8208;controlled TPS&#8208;2 nanoaggregates are found to serve as an adjuvant, promoting antigen accumulation and delivery to sufficiently boost the in vivo antitumor immunity by only one dose injection in a prophylactic tumor vaccination model. This work thus provides new insights into optimizing AIE photosensitizers via a hydrophobicity&#8211;hydrophilicity balance strategy for evoking an antitumor immunity and directly suppressing the distanced tumor. A single small&#8208;molecular system for PDT&#8208;stimulated antitumor immunity is envisioned.

         <title>Engineering Functionalized 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets with Fast Li+ Conduction for Advanced Solid Li&#160;Batteries</title>

Functionalized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) sheets have been designed through molecular engineering to construct high&#8208;performance composite electrolytes, where the electron&#8208;donating effect of substituents in 2D&#8208;MOFs effectively limits the movement of ClO4&#8208; and promotes mechanical properties and ion migration numbers (0.36 up to 0.64) of poly(ethylene oxide), delivering largely enhanced electrochemical performance. 








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries can ensure high energy density and safety in lithium metal batteries, while polymer electrolytes are plagued by slow ion kinetics and low selective transport of Li+. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are proposed as emerging fillers for solid&#8208;state poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO) electrolytes, however, developing functionalized MOFs and understanding their roles on ion transfer has proven challenging. Herein, combining computational and experimental results, the functional group regulation in MOFs can effectively change surficial charge distribution and limit anion movement is revealed, providing a potential solution to these issues. Specifically, functionalized 2D MOF sheets are designed through molecular engineering to construct high&#8208;performance composite electrolytes, where the electron&#8208;donating effect of substituents in 2D&#8208;MOFs effectively limits the movement of ClO4&#8722; and promotes mechanical properties and ion migration numbers (0.36 up to 0.64) of PEO. As a result, Li/Li cells with composite electrolyte exhibit superior cyclability for 1000&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the solid LiFePO4/Li battery delivers highly reversible capacities of 148.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 200&#160;cycles. These findings highlight a new approach for anion confinement through the use of functional group electronic effects, leading to enhanced ionic conductivity, and a feasible direction for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency of Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting by Structural Vibration Entropy in Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a promising energy harvesting system converting low&#8208;grade heat to usable electrochemical energy. In this work, the structural water molecules' influence is confirmed on the bond covalency. As a result, the small amount of water molecules induces strong A1g vibration which can enhance structural vibration, improving the performance of the TREC system.








Abstract
The majority of waste&#8208;heat energy exists in the form of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C), which is immensely difficult to convert into usable energy using conventional energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC), which integrate battery and thermal&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting functionalities, are considered an attractive system for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. Herein, the role of structural vibration modes in enhancing the efficacy of TREC systems is investigated. How changes in bonding covalency, influenced by the number of structural water molecules, impact the vibration modes is analyzed. It is discovered that even small amounts of water molecules can induce the A1g stretching mode of cyanide ligands with strong structural vibration energy, which significantly contributes to a larger temperature coefficient (&#593;) in a TREC system. Leveraging these insights, a highly efficient TREC system using a sodium&#8208;ion&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte is designed and implemented. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of TREC systems, offering a deeper understanding of the intrinsic properties of Prussian Blue analogs regulated by structural vibration modes. These insights open up new possibilities for enhancing the energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities of TREC systems.

         <title>Extreme &#947;&#8208;Ray Radiation Tolerance of Spectrometer&#8208;Grade CsPbBr3 Perovskite Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the new radiation detector material, CsPbBr3, holds up to high radiation doses often found in industrial settings and extreme radiation in space is evaluated. Remarkable stability is observed in detector performance after exposure to 1&#160;Mrad of Co&#8208;60 gamma radiation, with many devices still functional after being exposed to a 10&#160;Mrad dose over 3 days. Those that do not survive can still be refabricated into working detectors.








Abstract
The perovskite compound CsPbBr3 has recently been discovered as a promising room&#8208;temperature semiconductor radiation detector, offering an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture alternative to the current benchmark material Cd1&#8722;xZnxTe (CZT). The performance of CsPbBr3 sensors is evaluated under harsh conditions, such as high radiation doses often found in industrial settings and extreme radiation in space. Results show minimal degradation in detector performance after exposure to 1&#160;Mrad of Co&#8208;60 gamma radiation, with no significant change to energy resolution or hole mobility and lifetime. Additionally, many of the devices are still functional after being exposed to a 10&#160;Mrad dose over 3 days, and those that do not survive can still be refabricated into working detectors. These results suggest that the failure mode in these devices is likely related to the interface between the electrode and material and their reaction, or the electrode itself and not the material itself. Overall, the study suggests that CsPbBr3 has high potential as a reliable and efficient radiation detector in various applications, including those involving extreme fluxes and energies of gamma&#8208;ray radiation.

         <title>A Stretchable Polymer Conductor Through the Mutual Plasticization Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stretchable and conductive thin film electrodes are prepared by combing PEDOT:PSS with a mutually plasticized polyrotaxane dopant. Harsh acid&#8208;treatment for conductivity enhancement is avoided, and good solvent tolerance and high optical transparency are realized. The transparent electrochromic display that can bear stretching up to 80% strain is further developed, demonstrating its promising application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable conductors play key roles in the dynamic interfacing of electronic devices with soft human tissues. However, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve high electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability. Here, highly stretchable and conductive thin film electrodes are prepared by combining PEDOT:PSS and a mutually plasticized polymer dopant. Notably, harsh acid treatment for conductivity enhancement is avoided, and good solvent tolerance and high optical transparency are realized, all of which are essential to device fabrication. A transparent electrochromic display is further developed that can bear stretching up to 80% strain, demonstrating its promising application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Oxygen Compounds Coordinated Ruthenium Sites with Deprotonated and Low Oxophilic Microenvironments for Membrane Electrolyzer&#8208;Based H2&#8208;Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;oxygen compounds coordinated ruthenium sites (MOC&#8208;Ru) with deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments are created for modulating the adsorption&#8211;desorption of H* and OH*. Benefiting from the unique advantages of MOC, the MOC&#8208;Ru exhibits extremely low overpotential and ultralong stability in both acidic and alkaline hydrogen evolution. The MOC&#8208;Ru catalyst&#8208;equipped membrane electrolyzer displays outstanding activity and stability for continuous H2&#8208;production.








Abstract
Among the platinum&#8208;group metals, ruthenium (Ru), with a low water dissociation energy, is considered a promising alternative to substitute Pt for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, optimizing the adsorption&#8211;desorption energies of H* and OH* intermediates on Ru catalytic sites is extremely desirable but remains challenging. Inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of Mn&#8208;oxygen complex, this study reports to design Mn&#8208;oxygen compounds coordinated Ru sites (MOC&#8208;Ru) with deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments for modulating the adsorption&#8211;desorption of H* and OH* to promote HER kinetics. Benefiting from the unique advantages of MOC structures, including weakened H&#63743;OH bond at interface, electron donation ability, and deprotonation capability, the MOC&#8208;Ru exhibits extremely low overpotential and ultralong stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations elucidate that the MOC can accelerate water dissociation kinetics and promote OH* desorption in alkaline conditions and trigger the long&#8208;range H* spillover for H2&#8208;release in acid conditions. The outstanding activity and stability of membrane electrolyzer display that the MOC&#8208;Ru catalyst holds great potential as cathode for H2&#8208;production. This study provides essential insights into the crucial roles of deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments in HER catalysis and offers a new pathway to create an efficient water&#8208;splitting cathode.

         <title>Unique Tridentate Coordination Tailored Solvation Sheath Toward Highly Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates bi/tridentate coordination by designing a single&#8208;solvent electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. A newly developed bis(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)methane solvent featuring multiple oxygen ligand sites enables more anions access the solvation sheath, facilitating stable interfacial chemistryand fast de&#8208;solvation kinetics. The electrolyte exhibits good compatibility with high&#8208;loading cathodes and limited Li metal anodes, as well as wide&#8208;temperature adaptability for practical applications.








Abstract
Electrolyte optimization by solvent molecule design is recognized as an effective approach for stabilizing lithium (Li) metal batteries. However, the coordination pattern of Li ions&#160;(Li+) with solvent molecules is sparsely considered. Here, an electrolyte design strategy is reported based on bi/tridentate chelation of Li+ and solvent to tune the solvation structure. As a proof of concept, a novel solvent with multi&#8208;oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anion&#8208;aggregated solvation shell, enhancing the interfacial stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics. As a result, the as&#8208;developed electrolyte exhibits ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 1400&#160;h in symmetric cells with 50&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thin Li foils. When paired with high&#8208;loading LiFePO4, full cells maintain 92% capacity over 500 cycles and deliver improved electrochemical performances over a wide temperature range from &#8722;10 to 60&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the concept is validated in a pouch cell (570&#160;mAh), achieving a capacity retention of 99.5% after 100 cycles. This brand&#8208;new insight on electrolyte engineering provides guidelines for practical high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

         <title>Flagella of Tumor&#8208;Targeting Bacteria Trigger Local Hemorrhage to Reprogram Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages for Improved Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;specific and persistent hemorrhage is induced by flagella of tumor&#8208;targeting multiflagellate bacteria. The erythrophagocytosis of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) can increase intracellular heme accumulation. Artesunate forms a complex by specifically combining with heme to generate reactive oxygen species, which can enhance the pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization of TAMs and remodel tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment to improve antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype and lead to failure of antitumor therapy. Infiltrated erythrocytes during hemorrhage are recognized as a promising strategy for polarizing TAMs. However, novel materials that precisely induce tumor hemorrhage without affecting normal coagulation still face challenges. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria (flhDC VNP) are genetically constructed to realize precise tumor hemorrhage. FlhDC VNP colonizes the tumor and overexpresses flagella during proliferation. The flagella promote the expression of tumor necrosis factor &#945;, which induces local tumor hemorrhage. Infiltrated erythrocytes during the hemorrhage temporarily polarize macrophages to the M1 subtype. In the presence of artesunate, this short&#8208;lived polarization is transformed into a sustained polarization because artesunate and heme form a complex that continuously produces reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the flagella of active tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria may open up new strategies for reprogramming TAMs and improving antitumor therapy.

         <title>Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett&#8208;Mediated Formation of Antibacterial Microneedles for Long&#8208;Term Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial microneedles are developed via a simple strategy by depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto microneedles for risk reduction of microneedle&#8208;induced skin infection with long&#8208;term transdermal administration. This functional nanoparticle coating strategy, which features controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and simplicity of fabrication, provides a versatile platform for the expansion of microneedle applications.








Abstract
Microneedles (MNs) have become versatile platforms for minimally invasive transdermal drug delivery devices. However, there are concerns about MN&#8208;induced skin infections with long&#8208;term transdermal administration. Using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique, a simple method for depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto MNs is developed. This strategy has merits over conventional dip coating techniques, including controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and a straightforward fabrication process. This provides MNs with a fast&#8208;acting and long&#8208;lasting antibacterial effect. This&#160;study demonstrates that antibacterial MNs achieve superior bacterial elimination in vitro and in vivo without sacrificing payload capacity, drug release, or mechanical strength.

&lt;p&gt;Antibacterial microneedles are developed via a simple strategy by depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto microneedles for risk reduction of microneedle-induced skin infection with long-term transdermal administration. This functional nanoparticle coating strategy, which features controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and simplicity of fabrication, provides a versatile platform for the expansion of microneedle applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microneedles (MNs) have become versatile platforms for minimally invasive transdermal drug delivery devices. However, there are concerns about MN-induced skin infections with long-term transdermal administration. Using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique, a simple method for depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto MNs is developed. This strategy has merits over conventional dip coating techniques, including controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and a straightforward fabrication process. This provides MNs with a fast-acting and long-lasting antibacterial effect. This&#160;study demonstrates that antibacterial MNs achieve superior bacterial elimination in vitro and in vivo without sacrificing payload capacity, drug release, or mechanical strength. It is&#160;believed that such a functional nanoparticle coating technique offers a platform for the expansion of MNs function, especially in long-term transdermal drug delivery fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Luminescent HOF&#8208;Based Foam as Ultrafast and Ultrasensitive Pressure and Acoustic Bimodal Sensor for Human&#8211;Machine Interactive Object and Information Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent HOF&#8208;based foam is utilized as a pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor, which exhibits great sensitivity and a fast response time in pressure and sound sensing processes. The sensing mechanisms toward pressure and auditory are analyzed in detail by finite element simulation. The pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor is applied for object and word information recognition by human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Bionic sensors have extensively served smart robots, medical equipment, and flexible wearable devices. The luminescent pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor can be treated as a remarkable, multifunctional, integrated bionic device. Here, a blue&#8208;emitting hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;TTA) as luminogen combines with melamine foam (MF), generating the flexible and elastic HOF&#8208;TTA@MF (1 and 2) as a pressure&#8211;auditory bimodal sensor. In the luminescent pressure sensing process, 1 has excellent maximum sensitivity (132.02&#160;kPa&#8722;1), low minimum detection limit (0.0&#8239;1333&#160;Pa), fast response time (20&#160;ms), high precision and great recyclability. 2 as a luminescent auditory sensor exhibits the highest response to the 520&#160;Hz sound at 255&#8722;1453&#160;Hz. In the process of sensing sound at 520&#160;Hz, 2 possesses high sensitivity (1&#8239;648&#8239;441.3&#160;cps&#160;Pa&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2), low detection limit (0.36&#160;dB) and ultrafast response time (10&#160;ms) within 11.47&#8722;91.77&#160;dB. The sensing mechanisms toward pressure and auditory are analyzed in detail by finite element simulation. Furthermore, 1 and 2, as a human&#8211;machine interactive bimodal sensor, can recognize nine different objects and word information of &#8220;Health&#8221;, &#8220;Phone&#8221;, and &#8220;TongJi&#8221; with high accuracy and strong robustness. This work provides a facile fabricated method of luminescent HOF&#8208;based pressure&#8211;auditory bimodal sensors and endows them with new recognition functions and dimensions.

         <title>Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Printing of Anomalous Nernst Thermopile for Direct Sensing of Perpendicular Heat Flux</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel circuit design that counteracts the Seebeck effect has enabled the direct sensing of perpendicular heat flux using the anomalous Nernst effect thermopile. This allows for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of flexible and practical thermoelectric devices, with advantages including mass production, large area coverage, and reduced cost. Its applications are expected to drive future advances in thermal management technology.








Abstract
The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) converts heat flux perpendicular to the plane into electricity, in sharp contrast with the Seebeck effect (SE), enabling mass production, large area, and flexibility of their devices through ordinary thin&#8208;film fabrication techniques. Heat flux sensors, one of the most promising applications of ANE, are powerful devices for evaluating heat flow and can lead to energy savings through efficient thermal management. In reality, however, SE caused by the in&#8208;plane heat flux is always superimposed on the measurement signal, making it difficult to evaluate the perpendicular heat flux. Here, ANE&#8208;type heat flux sensors that selectively detect a perpendicular heat flux are fabricated by adjusting the net Seebeck coefficient in their thermopile circuit with mass&#8208;producible roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll sputtering methods. The direct sensing of perpendicular heat flux using ANE&#8208;based flexible thermopiles, as well as their simple fabrication process, paves the way for the practical application of thin&#8208;film thermoelectric devices.

         <title>Defect Engineering of a High&#8208;Entropy Metallic Glass Surface for High&#8208;Performance Overall Water Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect engineering strategy is presented to construct nanoporous high&#8208;entropy metallic glass with nanocrystalline surface structure that contains lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve ultralow overpotentials at ampere&#8208;level current density. It retains a long&#8208;term durability of 200&#160;h. The excellent performance is attributed to the defects for optimizing atomic configuration while the nanoporous architecture providing abundant active sites.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts possess high water electrolysis activity and are essential components for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A major challenge, however, is how to break the cost&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off. Here, a novel defect engineering strategy is presented to construct a nanoporous (FeCoNiB0.75)97Pt3 (atomic %) high&#8208;entropy metallic glass (HEMG) with a nanocrystalline surface structure that contains large amounts of lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance using only 3&#160;at% of Pt. The defect&#8208;rich HEMG achieves ultralow overpotentials at ampere&#8208;level current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER (104&#160;mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (301&#160;mV) under alkaline conditions, while retains a long&#8208;term durability exceeding 200&#160;h at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it only requires 81 and 122&#160;mV to drive the current densities of 1000 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively. Modelling results reveal that lattice distortion and stacking fault defects help to optimize atomic configuration and modulate electronic interaction, while the surface nanoporous architecture provides abundant active sites, thus synergistically contributing to the reduced energy barrier for water electrolysis. This defect engineering approach combined with a HEMG design strategy is expected to be widely applicable for development of high&#8208;performance alloy catalysts.

         <title>Engineering the Structural Uniformity of Gel Polymer Electrolytes via Pattern&#8208;Guided Alignment for Durable, Safe Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin gel polymer electrolyte (P&#8208;PPL) with patterned structure and superior mechanical toughness (&#8776;613%) for durable and safe solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery is developed. The special patterned structure enables rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li+ flux. The solid&#8208;state LiFePO4||P&#8208;PPL||Li batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, high rate capacity as well as high safety.








Abstract
Ultrathin and super&#8208;toughness gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are the key enabling technology for durable, safe, and high&#8208;energy density solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) but extremely challenging. However, GPEs with limited uniformity and continuity exhibit an uneven Li+ flux distribution, leading to nonuniform deposition. Herein, a fiber patterning strategy for developing and engineering ultrathin (16&#160;&#181;m) fibrous GPEs with high ionic conductivity (&#8776;0.4 mS cm&#8722;1) and superior mechanical toughness (&#8776;613%) for durable and safe SSLMBs is proposed. The special patterned structure provides fast Li+ transport channels and tailoring solvation structure of traditional LiPF6&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li+ flux, and boosting stability against Li anodes, thus realizing ultralong Li plating/stripping in the symmetrical cell over 3000&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the SSLMBs with high LiFePO4 loading of 10.58&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 deliver ultralong stable cycling life over 1570 cycles at 1.0 C with 92.5% capacity retention and excellent rate capacity of 129.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.2&#160;V (100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge).

&lt;p&gt;An ultrathin gel polymer electrolyte (P-PPL) with patterned structure and superior mechanical toughness (&#8776;613%) for durable and safe solid-state lithium metal battery is developed. The special patterned structure enables rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux. The solid-state LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||P-PPL||Li batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, high rate capacity as well as high safety.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin and super-toughness gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are the key enabling technology for durable, safe, and high-energy density solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) but extremely challenging. However, GPEs with limited uniformity and continuity exhibit an uneven Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux distribution, leading to nonuniform deposition. Herein, a fiber patterning strategy for developing and engineering ultrathin (16&#160;&#181;m) fibrous GPEs with high ionic conductivity (&#8776;0.4 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and superior mechanical toughness (&#8776;613%) for durable and safe SSLMBs is proposed. The special patterned structure provides fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channels and tailoring solvation structure of traditional LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-based carbonate electrolyte, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux, and boosting stability against Li anodes, thus realizing ultralong Li plating/stripping in the symmetrical cell over 3000&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the SSLMBs with high LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; loading of 10.58&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; deliver ultralong stable cycling life over 1570 cycles at 1.0 C with 92.5% capacity retention and excellent rate capacity of 129.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5.0 C with a cut-off voltage of 4.2&#160;V (100% depth-of-discharge). Patterned GPEs systems are powerful strategies for producing durable and safe SSLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dry&#8208;Transferable Photoresist Enabled Reliable Conformal Patterning for Ultrathin Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfabrication approach using synthesized high&#8208;resolution and environmentally friendly photoresists is demonstrated. This approach allows the transfer of photoresists onto various substrates to enable reliable conformal manufacturing of thin&#8208;film flexible electronics. Various exemplary demonstrations suggest the potential of this technology for many emerging applications, including flexible electronics, smart devices, bioelectronics, as well as human&#8208;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Photolithographic techniques, which are widely used in the silicon&#8208;based semiconductor industry, enable the manufacture of high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;resolution features at the micrometer and nanometer scales. However, conventional photolithographic processes cannot accommodate the micro/nanofabrication of flexible and stretchable electronics. In this study, a microfabrication approach that uses a synthesized, environmentally friendly, and dry&#8208;transferable photoresist to enable the reliable conformal manufacturing of thin&#8208;film electronics is reported, which is also compatible with the existing cleanroom processes. Photoresists with high&#8208;resolution, high&#8208;density, and multiscale patterns can be transferred onto various substrates in a defect&#8208;free and conformal&#8208;contact manner, thus enabling multiple wafer reuses. Theoretical studies are conducted to investigate the damage&#8208;free peel&#8208;off mechanism of the proposed approach. The in situ fabrication of various electrical components, including ultralight and ultrathin biopotential electrodes, has been demonstrated, which offer lower interfacial impedance, durability, and stability, and the components are applied to collect electromyography signals with superior signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) and quality. Additionally, an exemplary demonstration of a human&#8208;machine interface indicates the potential of these electrodes in many emerging applications, including healthcare, sensing, and artificial intelligence.

         <title>Boosting the Photoluminescence Efficiency of InAs Nanocrystals Synthesized with Aminoarsine via a ZnSe Thick&#8208;Shell Overgrowth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino&#8208;As based synthesis of InAs@ZnSe core@shell nanocrystals with shell thickness up to seven monolayers is reported. The InAs@ZnSe nanocrystals exhibit photoluminescence quantum yields up to 70%, a record value for such system, thanks to an In&#63743;Zn&#63743;Se interlayer featuring a structure similar to that of In2ZnSe4, which dampens the strain between the InAs core and the ZnSe shell.








Abstract
InAs&#8208;based nanocrystals can enable restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) compliant optoelectronic devices, but their photoluminescence efficiency needs improvement.&#160;We&#160;report an optimized synthesis of InAs@ZnSe core@shell nanocrystals allowing to tune the ZnSe shell thickness up to seven mono&#8208;layers (ML) and to boost the emission, reaching a quantum yield of &#8776;70% at &#8776;900&#160;nm. It is demonstrated that a high quantum yield can be attained when the shell thickness is at least &#8776;3ML. Notably, the photoluminescence lifetimeshows only a minor variation as a function of shell thickness, whereas the Auger recombination time (a limiting aspect in technological applications when fast) slows down from 11 to 38&#160;ps when increasing the shell thickness from 1.5 to 7MLs. Chemical and structural analyses evidence that InAs@ZnSe nanocrystals do not exhibit any strain at the core&#8208;shell interface, likely due to the formation of an In&#63743;Zn&#63743;Se interlayer. This is supported by atomistic modeling, which indicates the interlayer as being composed of In, Zn, Se and cation vacancies, alike to the In2ZnSe4 crystal structure. The simulations reveal an electronic structure consistent with that of type&#8208;I heterostructures, in which localized trap states can be passivated by a thick shell (&gt;3ML) and excitons are confined in the core.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;Jet&#8208;Printable Covalent Organic Framework Colloidal Inks and Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Nanocomposite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;synthesized, solution&#8208;processable covalent organic framework (COF) colloidal ink is demonstrated that enables aerosol jet printing of COFs with micron&#8208;scale resolution. The ink formulation is also compatible with other colloidal nanomaterials, thus facilitating the integration of COFs into printable nanocomposite films with highly tunable properties such as strongly temperature&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity.








Abstract
With molecularly well&#8208;defined and tailorable 2D structures, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as leading material candidates for chemical sensing, storage, separation, and catalysis. In these contexts, the ability to directly and deterministically print COFs into arbitrary geometries will enable rapid optimization and deployment. However, previous attempts to print COFs have been restricted by low spatial resolution and/or post&#8208;deposition polymerization that limits the range of compatible COFs. Here, these limitations are overcome with a pre&#8208;synthesized, solution&#8208;processable colloidal ink that enables aerosol jet printing of COFs with micron&#8208;scale resolution. The ink formulation utilizes the low&#8208;volatility solvent benzonitrile, which is critical to obtaining homogeneous printed COF film morphologies. This ink formulation is also compatible with other colloidal nanomaterials, thus facilitating the integration of COFs into printable nanocomposite films. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, boronate&#8208;ester COFs are integrated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form printable COF&#8208;CNT nanocomposite films, in which the CNTs enhance charge transport and temperature sensing performance, ultimately resulting in high&#8208;sensitivity temperature sensors that show electrical conductivity variation by 4 orders of magnitude between room temperature and 300&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work establishes a flexible platform for COF additive manufacturing that will accelerate the incorporation of COFs into technologically significant applications.

         <title>Chiral MOF Derived Wearable Logic Sensor for Intuitive Discrimination of Physiologically Active Enantiomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective wearable membrane sensor with dual colorimetric response to lactate enantiomers is developed. The sensor can intuitively index the exercise intensity via the dual colorimetric changes readable to naked eyes, and a chiral IMPLICATION logic gate can be further achieved for smart sensor design.








Abstract
Chiral sensors have attracted growing interest due to their application in health monitoring. However, rational design of wearable logic chiral sensors remains a great challenge. In this work, a dual responsive chiral sensor RT@CDMOF is prepared through in situ self&#8208;assembly of chiral &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework (CDMOF), rhodamine 6G hydrazide (RGH), and tetracyanovinylindane (TCN). The embedded RGH and TCN inherit the chirality of host CDMOF, producing dual changes both in fluorescence and reflectance. RT@CDMOF is explored as a dual channel sensor for chiral discrimination of lactate enantiomers. Comprehensive mechanistic studies reveal the chiral binding process, and carboxylate dissociation is confirmed by impedance and solid&#8208;state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A flexible membrane sensor is successfully fabricated based on RT@CDMOF for wearable health monitoring. Practical evaluation confirms the potential of fabricated membrane sensor in point&#8208;of&#8208;care health monitoring by indexing the exercise intensity. Based on above, a chiral IMPLICATION logic unit can be successfully achieved, demonstrating the promising potential of RT@CDMOF in design and assembly of novel smart devices. This work may open a new avenue to the rational design of logic chiral sensors for wearable health monitoring applications.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral sensors have attracted growing interest due to their application in health monitoring. However, rational design of wearable logic chiral sensors remains a great challenge. In this work, a dual responsive chiral sensor RT@CDMOF is prepared through in situ self-assembly of chiral &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (CDMOF), rhodamine 6G hydrazide (RGH), and tetracyanovinylindane (TCN). The embedded RGH and TCN inherit the chirality of host CDMOF, producing dual changes both in fluorescence and reflectance. RT@CDMOF is explored as a dual channel sensor for chiral discrimination of lactate enantiomers. Comprehensive mechanistic studies reveal the chiral binding process, and carboxylate dissociation is confirmed by impedance and solid-state &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A flexible membrane sensor is successfully fabricated based on RT@CDMOF for wearable health monitoring. Practical evaluation confirms the potential of fabricated membrane sensor in point-of-care health monitoring by indexing the exercise intensity. Based on above, a chiral IMPLICATION logic unit can be successfully achieved, demonstrating the promising potential of RT@CDMOF in design and assembly of novel smart devices. This work may open a new avenue to the rational design of logic chiral sensors for wearable health monitoring applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 Lateral Heterostructures and Their Tunable Optoelectronic Properties</title>

2H&#8208;1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 lateral heterostructures are grown by a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition method, and the optoelectronic properties of 2H&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2, 1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2, and MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures are thoroughly studied. Under 405&#8201;nm laser irradiation, 2H&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 exhibits a positive photoconductive effect, while 1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 shows a negative photoconductive effect. The optoelectronic response characteristics of MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage.








Abstract
Constructing heterostructures and doping are valid ways to improve the optoelectronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and optimize the performance of TMDs&#8208;based photodetectors. Compared with transfer techniques, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has higher efficiency in preparing heterostructures. As for the one&#8208;step CVD growth of heterostructures, cross&#8208;contamination between the two materials may occur during the growth process, which may provide the possibility of one&#8208;step simultaneous realization of controllable doping and formation of alloy&#8208;based heterostructures by finely tuning the growth dynamics. Here, 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy lateral heterostructures are synthesized through this one&#8208;step CVD growth method, utilizing the cross&#8208;contamination and different growth temperatures of the two alloys. Due to the doping of a small amount of Re atoms in 2H MoS2, 2H MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 has a high response rejection ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV) region and exhibits a positive photoconductive (PPC) effect. While the 1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 formed by heavily doping Mo atoms into 1T' ReS2 will produce a negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect under UV laser irradiation. The optoelectronic property of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage. These findings are expected to expand the functionality of traditional optoelectronic devices and have potential applications in optoelectronic logic devices.

         <title>Doping Engineering to Modulate Lattice and Electronic Structure for Enhanced Piezocatalytic Therapy and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable, mesoporous, piezoelectric Mn&#8208;doped ZnO nanocluster is first constructed via a facile doping engineering strategy. The peizocatalytic performance of Mn&#8211;ZnO is significantly enhanced due to the generation of built&#8208;in electric field and oxygen vacancy by regulation of lattice space and electronic structure, thereby remarkably enhancing the ROS generation for piezocatalytic therapy and ferroptosis.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mechanical force, has garnered extensive attention for its use in cancer therapy owing to its deep tissue penetration depth and less O2&#8208;dependence. However, the piezocatalytic therapeutic efficiency is limited owing to the poor piezoresponse, low separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs, and complicated tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a biodegradable, porous Mn&#8208;doped ZnO (Mn&#8211;ZnO)&#160;nanocluster with enhanced piezoelectric effect is constructed via doping engineering. Mn&#8208;doping not only induces lattice distortion to increase polarization but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (OV) for suppressing the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs, leading to high&#8208;efficiency generation of ROS under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, Mn&#8208;doped ZnO shows TME&#8208;responsive multienzyme&#8208;mimicking activity&#160;and&#160;glutathione (GSH) depletion ability owing to the mixed valence of Mn (II/III), further aggravating oxidative stress. Density functional theory calculations show that Mn&#8208;doping can improve the piezocatalytic performance and enzyme activity of Mn&#8211;ZnO due to the presence of OV. Benefiting from the boosting of ROS generation and GSH depletion ability, Mn&#8211;ZnO can significantly accelerate the accumulation of lipid peroxide and inactivate glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to induce ferroptosis. The work may provide new guidance for exploring novel piezoelectric sonosensitizers for tumor therapy.

Curved Nanographene
In article number 2212064, Sergio Ram&#237;rez&#8208;Barroso, David Garc&#237;a&#8208;Fresnadillo, In&#233;s Corral, Nazario Mart&#237;n, Reinhold Wannemacher, and co&#8208;workers scrutinize the photophysics of curved nanographenes. The intricate topography of their potential energy surfaces facilitates multiple and non&#8208;Kasha emission from singlets and triplets and TADF phenomena, which are expected to bring about breakthroughs in material science, as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and theranostics, combining bioimaging and photosensitization.

Monolayer Graphene
In article number 2301441, Matteo Jugovac, Paolo Perna, and co&#8208;workers experimentally discover the existence of a single spin&#8208;polarized flat band in monolayer graphene. The flat band is formed by controlling the doping level of graphene grown on a ferromagnetic cobalt film via europium intercalation. Due to the peculiar adsorption geometry at the interface, the experimental Fermi surfaces resemble Alhambra&#8208;style mosaics.

Core@shell Nanocrystals
In article number 2303621, Gabriele Saleh, Luca De Trizio, Liberato Manna, and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting InAs@ZnSe core@shell nanocrystals with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). The high PLQY stems from the in situ formation of an In&#8211;Zn&#8211;Se interlayer which plays a key role in dampening the strain between the InAs core and the ZnSe shell.

3D Printing
In article number 2208230, Chunyan Zhang, Baohui Shi, Kun Kelvin Fu, and co&#8208;workers present a composite fabrication technique that involves printing a &#8220;green&#8221; part that contains a polymer&#8208;bonded mesoscale carbon architecture, followed by de&#8208;binding and pyrolysis (carbonization) to remove the binder component and obtain a &#8220;brown&#8221; part (near replica). The process can produce nanomaterial&#8208;assembled architectures with 3D geometry and multiscale features.

         <title>Recent Progress in Colloidal Quantum Dot Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable semiconducting quantum dots possess numerous fascinating properties sought for emerging thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics. Herein, key recent developments in colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) for thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics are discussed. The challenges and opportunities in developing efficient CQD&#8208;based thin&#8208;film thermoelectric generators operating near room temperature are highlighted.








Abstract
Semiconducting colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) represent an emerging class of thermoelectric materials for use in a wide range of future applications. CQDs combine solution processability at low temperatures with the potential for upscalable manufacturing via printing techniques. Moreover, due to their low dimensionality, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and a high density of grain boundaries, which can be independently exploited to tune the Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity, respectively. This unique combination of attractive attributes makes CQDs very promising for application in emerging thermoelectric generator (TEG) technologies operating near room temperature. Herein, recent progress in CQDs for application in emerging thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics is reviewed. First,&#160;the fundamental concepts of thermoelectricity in nanostructured materials are outlined, followed by an overview of the popular synthetic methods used to produce CQDs with controllable sizes and shapes. Recent strides in CQD&#8208;based thermoelectrics are then discussed with emphasis on their application in thin&#8208;film TEGs. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives for further enhancing the performance of CQD&#8208;based thermoelectric materials for future applications are discussed.

         <title>Defect Engineering in Biomedical Sciences</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;engineering of nanomaterials has become a hot topic in recent years because of the resulting excellent physical and chemical properties. Importantly, the properties of nanomaterials can be improved by adjusting the type and concentration of defects. An overview about defect engineering in biomedical science is presented with a view to provide researchers with new ideas from the perspective of materials science.








Abstract
With the promotion of nanochemistry research, large numbers of nanomaterials have been applied in vivo to produce desirable cytotoxic substances in response to endogenous or exogenous stimuli for achieving disease&#8208;specific therapy. However, the performance of nanomaterials is a critical issue that is difficult to improve and optimize under biological conditions. Defect&#8208;engineered nanoparticles have become the most researched hot materials in biomedical applications recently due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as optical properties and redox reaction capabilities. Importantly, the properties of nanomaterials can be easily adjusted by regulating the type and concentration of defects in the nanoparticles without requiring other complex designs. Therefore, this tutorial review focuses on biomedical defect engineering and briefly discusses defect classification, introduction strategies, and characterization techniques. Several representative defective nanomaterials are especially discussed in order to reveal the relationship between defects and properties. A series of disease treatment strategies based on defective engineered nanomaterials are summarized. By summarizing the design and application of defective engineered nanomaterials, a simple but effective methodology is provided for researchers to design and improve the therapeutic effects of nanomaterial&#8208;based therapeutic platforms from a materials science perspective.

         <title>Tuning the Coordination Environment of Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Doping with Multiple Heteroatoms and Their Applications in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of the coordination environment of carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) by doping multi&#8208;heteroatoms and its application in electrochemical reactions are systematically reviewed. The reaction mechanism and structure&#8211;activity relationship of carbon&#8208;based SACs are discussed by combining experimental results and theoretical calculations. Some suggestions are proposed regarding the challenges facing this strategy for the future development of carbon&#8208;based SACs.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered to be a perfect platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationship of different reactions due to the adjustability of their coordination environment. Multi&#8208;heteroatom doping has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for tuning the coordination environment of carbon&#8208;based SACs and enhancing catalytic performance in electrochemical reactions. Herein, recently developed strategies for multi&#8208;heteroatom doping, focusing on the regulation of single&#8208;atom active sites by heteroatoms in different coordination shells, are summarized. In addition, the correlation between the coordination environment and the catalytic activity of carbon&#8208;based SACs are investigated through representative experiments and theoretical calculations for various electrochemical reactions. Finally, concerning certain shortcomings of the current strategies of doping multi&#8208;heteroatoms, some suggestions are put forward to promote the development of carbon&#8208;based SACs in the field of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Carbonization &#8211; A Powerful Tool for Micro&#8208;Fabrication of Patterned Electronic Carbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on fundamentals and potential applications: Laser&#8208;induced carbonization is a versatile tool for the direct fabrication of functional carbon patterns. By selection of precursors and process parameters, the properties of the laser&#8208;patterned carbons are tuned to meet the materials requirements for different applications like micro&#8208;energy storage, electrocatalysis, sensors, or antenna&#8208;related devices.








Abstract
Fabricating electronic devices from natural, renewable resources is a common goal in engineering and materials science. In this regard, carbon is of special significance due to its biocompatibility combined with electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability. In microelectronics, however, carbon's device application is often inhibited by tedious and expensive preparation processes and a lack of control over processing and material parameters. Laser&#8208;assisted carbonization is emerging as a tool for the precise and selective synthesis of functional carbon&#8208;based materials for flexible device applications. In contrast to conventional carbonization via in&#8208;furnace pyrolysis, laser&#8208;carbonization is induced photo&#8208;thermally and occurs on the time&#8208;scale of milliseconds. By careful selection of the precursors and process parameters, the properties of this so&#8208;called laser&#8208;patterned carbon (LP&#8208;C) such as porosity, surface polarity, functional groups, degree of graphitization, charge&#8208;carrier structure, etc. can be tuned. In this critical review, a common perspective is generated on laser&#8208;carbonization in the context of general carbonization strategies, fundamentals of laser&#8208;induced materials processing, and flexible electronic applications, like electrodes for sensors, electrocatalysts, energy storage, or antennas. An attempt is made to have equal emphasis on material processing and application aspects such that this emerging technology can be optimally positioned in the broader context of carbon&#8208;based microfabrication.

         <title>In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in the in situ transmission electron microscopy investigations on dynamic transformation and the corresponding morphological, structural, and chemical evolutions during the sodium storage process in the sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) including cathode materials, anode materials, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface. This review aims to clarify the structure/composition&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship and to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attentions in recent years due to the abundance and wide distribution of Na resource on the earth. However, SIBs still face the critical issues of low energy density and unsatisfactory cyclic stability at present. The enhancement of electrochemical performance of SIBs depends on comprehensive and precise understanding of the underlying sodium storage mechanism. Although extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations have been performed to reveal the sodium storage property and mechanism of SIBs, a dedicated review on the in situ TEM investigations of SIBs has not been reported. In this review, recent progress in the in situ TEM investigations on the morphological, structural, and chemical evolutions of cathode materials, anode materials, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface during the sodium storage of SIBs is comprehensively summarized. The detailed relationship between structure/composition of electrode materials and electrochemical performance of SIBs has been clarified. This review aims to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.

The detailed relationship between structure/composition of electrode materials and electrochemical performance of SIBs has been clarified. This review aims to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high-performance SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microfluidic&#8208;Assembled Covalent Organic Frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene Vertical Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance electrochemical supercapacitor based on vertically structured covalent organic frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene fiber is developed via one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis. Due to vertical ion transport channels, sufficient ion&#8208;accessible area, decreased ion adsorption energy, excellent pseudocapacitive activity, and strong interfacial electron migration, the supercapacitors exhibit large capacitance, high energy density, excellent cycling stability, and wearable applications.








Abstract
The delicate design of innovative and sophisticated fibers with vertical porous skeleton and eminent electrochemical activity to generate directional ionic pathways and good faradic charge accessibility is pivotal but challenging for realizing high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Here, hierarchically ordered hybrid fiber combined vertical&#8208;aligned and conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene (VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) with interstratified electroactive covalent organic frameworks LZU1 (COF&#8208;LZU1) by one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis is developed. Due to the incorporation of vertical channels, abundant redox active sites and large accessible surface area throughout the electrode, the VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx@COF&#8208;LZU1 fibers express exceptional gravimetric capacitance of 787&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 in a three&#8208;electrode system. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state asymmetric FSCs deliver a prominent energy density of 27&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, capacitance of 398&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 and cycling life of 20&#160;000 cycles. The key to high energy storage ability originates from the decreased ions adsorption energy and ameliorative charge density distribution in vertically aligned and active hybrid fiber, accelerating ions transportation/accommodation and interfacial electrons transfer. Benefiting from excellent electrochemical performance, the FSCs offer sufficient energy supply to power watches, flags, and digital display tubes as well as be integrated with sensors to detect pulse signals, which opens a promising route for architecting advanced fiber toward the carbon neutrality market beyond energy&#8208;storage technology.

         <title>Ductile Oligomeric Acceptor&#8208;Modified Flexible Organic Solar Cells Show Excellent Mechanical Robustness and Near 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligomeric acceptors with different flexible alkyl chains (DOY&#8208;C2, DOY&#8208;C4, and TOY&#8208;C4) are synthesized. When doped into D18:N3 system, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.01% and 17.91% are achieved in rigid and flexible devices based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of ternary films are also successfully improved due to form tie and entangled chain networks.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (PD) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs are fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the PD:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs are characterized. By introducing DOA DOY&#8208;C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4&#8208;based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3&#8208;based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Perovskite&#8208;Based Photodetector and Memristor for Visual Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor is designed, realizing visual perception and memory capacities. The dual&#8208;functional device exhibit excellent performance in both PD and memristor. Such a device provides new opportunities for the mimicry of human visual memory in future multifunctional application.








Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. However, the combination&#160;of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor are designed to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realizes an ultrahigh self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276&#160;mA W&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;100 (&#177;2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultrahigh on/off ratio (&#8776;105), an ultralow power consumption of 3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000&#160;s) are realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. This device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provides new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Molecular Orbitals and Spatial Symmetry in an Optically Controlled Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry enables the optical control of two ferroelectric states between the closed&#8208;ring and open&#8208;ring forms of a photochromic organic ferroelectric, which is an unprecedented mechanism in ferroelectrics and brings a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
As particles carry quantified energy, photon radiation enables orbital transitions of energy levels, leading to changes in the spin state of electrons. The resulting switchable structural bistability may bring a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. However, the studies on molecular orbital breaking in the ferroelectric field remain blank. Here, for the first time, a new mechanism of ferroelectrics&#8212;dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry, demonstrated in a photochromic organic crystal with light&#8208;induced polarization switching, is formally proposed. By alternating the ultraviolet/visible light irradiation, the states of electron spin and the radial distribution p atomic orbitals experience a change, showing a reversible switch from &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; form to a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; form. This reflects a reversible conversion between &#960; and &#963; bonds, which induces and couples with the variation of spatial symmetry. The intersection of spatial symmetry breaking and molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics present in this work will be more conducive to data encryption and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction of (Fe,Ni)OOH via Defect Engineering for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis Under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst is prepared through an energy&#8208;saving cation exchange method. It exhibits good catalytic durability and structural stability for large&#8208;scale alkaline water oxidation under industrial conditions. When coupled with NiMoN and assembled in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH&#8208;NiMoN pair shows outstanding overall water electrolysis performance.








Abstract
Developing non&#8208;precious catalysts with long&#8208;term catalytic durability and structural stability under industrial conditions is the key to practical alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. Here, an energy&#8208;saving approach is proposed to synthesize defect&#8208;rich iron nickel oxyhydroxide for stability and efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from in situ cation exchange, the nanosheet&#8208;nanoflake&#8208;structured catalyst is homogeneously embedded in, and tightly bonded to, its substrate, making it ultrastable at high current densities. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the introduction of Ni in FeOOH reduces the activation energy barrier for the catalytic reaction and that the purposely created oxygen defects not only ensure the exposure of active sites and maximize the effective catalyst surface but also modulate the local coordination environment and chemisorption properties of both Fe and Ni sites, thus lowering the energy barrier from *O to *OOH. Consequently, the optimized d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with long&#8208;term durability under both laboratory and industrial conditions. The large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH||NiMoN pair requires 1.795&#160;V to reach a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an absolute current of 12.5 A in an AEM electrolyzer for overall water electrolysis, showing great potential for industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Bacteriochlorin Nanosheet as a Specific Pyroptosis Inducer for Robust Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheets as a specific pyroptosis inducer exhibit the ability to induce both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy to produce potent reactive oxygen species, leading to pyroptosis of primary tumors while promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity for inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases with minimal systemic side effects.








Abstract
Pyroptosis is increasingly considered a new weathervane in cancer immune therapy. However, triggering specific pyroptotic tumor cell death while preserving normal cells still remains a major challenge. Herein, a brand&#8208;new pyroptosis inducer, copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheet (Cu&#8208;TBB), is designed. The synthesized Cu&#8208;TBB can&#160;be activated to an &#8220;on&#8221; state in the tumor microenvironment with glutathione (GSH) overexpression, leading to the release of Cu+ and TBB, respectively. Intriguingly, the released Cu+ can&#160;drive cascade reactions to produce O2&#8722;&#8226; and highly toxic &#183;OH in cells. Additionally, the released TBB can&#160;also generate O2&#8722;&#8226; and 1O2 upon 750&#160;nm laser irradiation. Encouragingly, both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy pathways result in potent pyroptosis along with dendritic cell maturation and T cell priming, thus simultaneously eliminating the primary tumors and inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases. Conclusively, the well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;TBB nanosheet is shown to trigger specific pyroptosis in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo, leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.

         <title>Rational Design of Orally Administered Cascade Nanozyme for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Materials Project is used as a candidate database to establish a rational nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening method for multifaceted therapeutic demands for IBD. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching nanozyme, with 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold higher activity than natural superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively, and its therapeutic effectiveness is demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;inflammatory models.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of individuals worldwide annually. Enteric reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in the physiology and pathology of IBD. Nanozymes hold great promise for the treatment of IBD because of their exceptional ability to regulate redox homeostasis during ROS&#8208;related inflammation. However, the rapid development of orally administered, acid&#8208;tolerant, antioxidant nanozymes for IBD therapy is challenging. Here, a nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening strategy is established to address the multifaceted IBD treatment demands, including intrinsic stability, radioactivity, solubility, gut microbiome toxicity, biomimetic elements, intermediate frontier molecular orbitals, reaction energy barriers, negative charges, and acid tolerance. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching material from 146&#160;323 candidates, which exhibits superoxide dismutase&#8208;catalase bienzyme&#8208;like activity and is 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold more active than natural enzymes. As demonstrated in a mouse model, Ni3S4 is stable in the gastrointestinal tract without toxicity and specifically targets the diseased colon to alleviate oxidative stress. RNA and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that Ni3S4 effectively inhibits the cellular pathways of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and restores the gut microbiota. This study not develops a highly efficient orally administered cascade nanozyme for IBD therapy and offers a next&#8208;generation paradigm for the rational design of nanomedicine through data&#8208;driven approaches.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Perovskite LEDs with an Integrated Distributed Feedback Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave lasing in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator is achieved, showing a low threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. The LED can also work well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.








Abstract
Realization of electrically pumped laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processed semiconductors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Metal halide perovskites have shown great potential toward this goal due to their&#160;excellent optoelectronic properties. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) optically pumped lasing in a real electroluminescent device represents a key step to current&#8208;injection laser diodes, but it has not yet been realized. This is mainly due to the challenge of incorporating a resonant cavity into an efficient light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) able to sustain intensive carrier injection. Here, CW lasing is reported in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator, which shows a low lasing threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. Importantly, the LED works well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.

Abstract
Efficient blue phosphors remain a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To circumvent this obstacle, a series of Ir(III)&#8208;based carbene complexes bearing asymmetric di&#8208;N&#8208;aryl 6&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;b]pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene chelates, namely, f&#8208;ct6a&#8210;c, are synthesized, and their structures and photophysical properties are comprehensively investigated. Moreover, these emitters can undergo interconversion in refluxing 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, catalyzed by a mixture of sodium acetate (NaOAc) and p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH&#183;H2O) without decomposition. All Ir(III) complexes present good photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL = 83&#8211;88%) with peak maximum (max.) at 443&#8211;452&#160;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM = 66&#8211;73&#160;nm). Among all the fabricated OLED devices, f&#8208;ct6b delivers a max. external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage CIEx,y coordinates of (0.14, 0.12), whereas the hyper&#8208;OLED device based on f&#8208;ct6a and 5H,9H,11H,15H&#8208;[1,4] benzazaborino [2,3,4&#8208;kl][1,4]benzazaborino[4&#8242;,3&#8242;,2&#8242;:4,5][1,4]benzazaborino[3,2&#8208;b]phenazaborine&#8208;7,13&#8208;diamine, N7,N7,N13,N13,5,9,11,15&#8208;octaphenyl (&#957;&#8208;DABNA) exhibits max. EQE of 26.2% and CIEx,y of (0.12, 0.13). Finally, the corresponding tandem OLED with f&#8208;ct6b as dopant gives a max. luminance of over 10&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2 and max.

         <title>Evidence of Nodal Superconductivity in Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 with Hidden Order Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconventional, nodal superconductors appear in many strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. However, nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have not yet been reported. The scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on 1H&#8208;TaS2 demonstrate nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting states.








Abstract
Unconventional superconductors represent one of the fundamental directions in modern quantum materials research. In particular, nodal superconductors are known to appear naturally in strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. Van der Waals materials hosting superconducting states are well known, yet nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have remained elusive. Here, using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, it is shown that pristine monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 realizes a nodal superconducting state. Non&#8208;magnetic disorder drives the nodal superconducting state to a conventional gapped s&#8208;wave state. Furthermore, many&#8208;body excitations emerge close to the gap edge, signalling a potential unconventional pairing mechanism. The results demonstrate the emergence of nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting&#160;states.

         <title>A Bionic Skin for Health Management: Excellent Breathability, In Situ Sensing, and Big Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, an intelligent bionic skin patch for health management is developed by integrating bionic structures, nano&#8208;welding technology, and flexible circuit design. The smart breathable membrane closely resembles human skin, exhibiting excellent air/moisture permeability, one&#8208;side sweat&#8208;wicking properties, multifunctional sensing functions, and big data analysis.








Abstract
Developing an intelligent wearable system is of great significance to human health management. An ideal health&#8208;monitoring patch should possess key characteristics such as high air permeability, moisture&#8208;wicking function, high sensitivity, and a comfortable user experience. However, such a patch that encompasses all these functions is rarely reported. Herein, an intelligent bionic skin patch for health management is developed by integrating bionic structures, nano&#8208;welding technology, flexible circuit design, multifunctional sensing functions, and big data analysis using advanced electrospinning technology. By controlling the preparation of nanofibers and constructing bionic secondary structures, the resulting nanofiber membrane closely resembles human skin, exhibiting excellent air/moisture permeability, and one&#8208;side sweat&#8208;wicking properties. Additionally, the bionic patch is endowed with a high&#8208;precision signal acquisition capabilities for sweat metabolites, including glucose, lactic acid, and pH; skin temperature, skin impedance, and electromyographic signals can be precisely measured through the in situ sensing electrodes and flexible circuit design. The achieved intelligent bionic skin patch holds great potential for applications in health management systems and rehabilitation engineering management. The design of the smart bionic patch not only provides high practical value for health management but also has great theoretical value for the development of the new generation of wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of Au/Co dual single atom (DSA) loaded CdS for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A reversed electron transfer mechanism is confirmed for this Au/Co DSA that leads to localized electrons around Co, and delocalized electrons from Au. This boosts electron transfer and CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction leading to a highly significant increase in reduction.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO2 photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts is reported. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated electrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts, however, electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO2 molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO2 reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &#8776;2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH4 compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO2. Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in DSA&#8208;loaded catalysts for the generation of solar fuels.

         <title>Virus&#8208;Based Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of heat&#8208;induced electrical potential generation and detection of a virus is demonstrated. Bio&#8208;pyroelectricity is manifested by the unfolding of &#945;&#8208;helical protein structure and can be tuned by genetic engineering. This biopyroelectrics introduce novel opportunities to detect various viral particles and facilitate the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.








Abstract
The first observation of heat&#8208;induced electrical potential generation on a virus and its detection through pyroelectricity are presented. Specifically, the authors investigate the pyroelectric properties of the M13 phage, which possesses inherent dipole structures derived from the noncentrosymmetric arrangement of the major coat protein (pVIII) with an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation. Unidirectional polarization of the phage is achieved through genetic engineering of the tail protein (pIII) and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly techniques. By modifying the pVIII proteins with varying numbers of glutamate residues, the structure&#8208;dependent tunable pyroelectric properties of the phage are explored. The most polarized phage exhibits a pyroelectric coefficient of 0.13 &#181;C m&#8722;2 &#176;C&#8722;1. Computational modeling and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy analysis confirm that the unfolding of &#945;&#8208;helices within the pVIII proteins leads to changes in phage polarization upon heating. Moreover, the phage is genetically modified to enable its pyroelectric function in diverse chemical environments. This phage&#8208;based approach not only provides valuable insights into bio&#8208;pyroelectricity but also opens up new opportunities for the detection of various viral particles.

     alt="Virus-Based Pyroelectricity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first observation of heat-induced electrical potential generation and detection of a virus is demonstrated. Bio-pyroelectricity is manifested by the unfolding of &#945;-helical protein structure and can be tuned by genetic engineering. This biopyroelectrics introduce novel opportunities to detect various viral particles and facilitate the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first observation of heat-induced electrical potential generation on a virus and its detection through pyroelectricity are presented. Specifically, the authors investigate the pyroelectric properties of the M13 phage, which possesses inherent dipole structures derived from the noncentrosymmetric arrangement of the major coat protein (pVIII) with an &#945;-helical conformation. Unidirectional polarization of the phage is achieved through genetic engineering of the tail protein (pIII) and template-assisted self-assembly techniques. By modifying the pVIII proteins with varying numbers of glutamate residues, the structure-dependent tunable pyroelectric properties of the phage are explored. The most polarized phage exhibits a pyroelectric coefficient of 0.13 &#181;C m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; &#176;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Computational modeling and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy analysis confirm that the unfolding of &#945;-helices within the pVIII proteins leads to changes in phage polarization upon heating. Moreover, the phage is genetically modified to enable its pyroelectric function in diverse chemical environments. This phage-based approach not only provides valuable insights into bio-pyroelectricity but also opens up new opportunities for the detection of various viral particles. Furthermore, it holds great potential for the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquids with High Compressibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional liquids are barely compressible. However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.








Abstract
Compressibility is a fundamental property of all materials. For fluids, that is, gases and liquids, compressibility forms the basis of technologies such as pneumatics and hydraulics and determines basic phenomena such as the propagation of sound and shock waves. In contrast to gases, liquids are almost incompressible. If the compressibility of liquids could be increased and controlled, new applications in hydraulics and shock absorption could result. Here, it is shown that dispersing hydrophobic porous particles into water gives aqueous suspensions with much greater compressibilities than any normal liquids such as water (specifically, up to 20 times greater over certain pressure ranges). The increased compressibility results from water molecules being forced into the hydrophobic pores of the particles under applied pressure. The degree of compression can be controlled by varying the amount of porous particles added. Also, the pressure range of compression can be reduced by adding methanol or increased by adding salt. In all cases, the liquids expand back to their original volume when the applied pressure is released. The approach shown here is simple and economical and could potentially be scaled up to give large amounts of highly compressible liquids.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte is developed to realize cycle&#8208;stable Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with fast kinetics. Polyanionic hydrogel with high zincophilicity uniformizes Zn2+ flux and retards polyiodides/SO42&#8211; transport, leading to a dendrite&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;free Zn anode. Iodophilic polycationic hydrogel alleviates the shuttling of polyiodides and boosts the reaction kinetics at hydrogel/carbon interface for iodine species.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (ZIB) are regarded as a promising energy storage candidate. However, soluble polyiodide shuttling and rampant Zn dendrite growth hamper its commercial implementation. Herein, a hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel is designed as the electrolyte for ZIBs. On the cathode side, iodophilic polycationic hydrogel (PCH) effectively alleviates the shuttle effect and facilitates the redox kinetics of iodine species. Meanwhile, polyanionic hydrogel (PAH) toward Zn metal anode uniformizes Zn2+ flux and prevents surface corrosion by electrostatic repulsion of polyiodides. Consequently, the Zn symmetric cells with PAH electrolyte demonstrate remarkable cycling stability over 3000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (1 mAh cm&#8211;2) and 800&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (5 mAh cm&#8211;2). Moreover, the Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with PAH&#8208;PCH hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte deliver a low&#8208;capacity decay of 0.008 &#8240; per cycle during 18&#160;000 cycles at 8 C. This work sheds light on hydrogel electrolytes design for long&#8208;life conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.

         <title>Bifacial and Semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells for Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells exhibit exceptional bifaciality of 0.86 and satisfactory long&#8208;wavelength transmittance exceeding 60%, highly suitable for initial real&#8208;world applications that leverage their ability to effectively absorb tilted incident illumination and enhance performance by exploiting albedo. Furthermore, their compatibility with silicon solar cells enables their integration in tandem applications, unlocking further potential for promoted efficiency.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film solar cells are expected to play a significant role in the space industry, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), indoor applications, and tandem solar cells, where bifaciality and semitransparency are highly desired. Sb2(S,Se)3 has emerged as a promising new photovoltaic (PV) material for its high absorption coefficient, tunable bandgap, and nontoxic and earth&#8208;abundant constituents. However, high&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells exclusively employ monofacial architectures, leaving a considerable gap toward large&#8208;scale application in aforementioned fields. Here, a bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell and its extended application in tandem solar cells are reported. The transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and the ultrathin inner n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure provide high long&#8208;wavelength transmittance. Despite the MnS/ITO Schottky junction, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.41% and 6.36% are achieved with front and rear illumination, respectively, contributing to a great bifaciality of 0.86. Consequently, the reported device gains great enhancement in PV performance by exploiting albedo of surroundings and shows exceptional capability in absorbing tilt incident light. Moreover, an&#160;Sb2(S,Se)3/Si tandem solar cell with a PCE of 11.66% is achieved in preliminary trials. These exciting findings imply that bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells possess tremendous potential in practical applications based on their unique characteristics.

         <title>Colossal Optical Anisotropy from Atomic&#8208;Scale Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle atomic&#8208;scale structural modulations of a crystal can dramatically change its optical properties. Single&#8208;crystal plates of modulated quasi&#8208;1D chalcogenide Sr9/8TiS3 are shown to have a record in&#8208;plane birefringence &#916;n = ne &#8722; no = 2.1 (ne = 4.5,&#8197;no = 2.4) within a broad transparent window in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. Structural modulation will be a new tool in realizing materials with large degrees of optical and optoelectronic anisotropy.








Abstract
Materials with large birefringence (&#916;n, where n is the refractive index) are sought after for polarization control (e.g., in wave plates, polarizing beam splitters, etc.), nonlinear optics, micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional light&#8211;matter coupling, such as hyperbolic phonon polaritons. Layered 2D&#160;materials can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy; however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optical axis is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached. This work demonstrates that a bulk crystal with subtle periodic modulations in its structure&#8212;Sr9/8TiS3&#8212;is transparent and positive&#8208;uniaxial, with extraordinary index ne = 4.5 and ordinary index no = 2.4 in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6 trigonal&#8208;prismatic units that break the chains of face&#8208;sharing TiS6 octahedra in SrTiS3 into periodic blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr form highly oriented electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index ne and result in record birefringence (&#916;n &gt; 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive&#8208;index modulation.

The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, results in the formation of TiS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; trigonal-prismatic units that break the chains of face-sharing TiS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra in SrTiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into periodic blocks of five TiS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr form highly oriented electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and result in record birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive-index modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Memristors&#8208;Based Dendritic Neuron&#160;for High&#8208;Efficiency Spatial&#8208;Temporal Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the microscopic dynamics in biological system, a dynamic memristor as an artificial dendrite and a Mott memristor as a spike&#8208;firing soma are integrated to construct a dendritic neuron for high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Furthermore, a bio&#8208;plausible dendritic neural network is hardware implemented to demonstrate human&#8208;motion recognition, showing nearly 20% improvement in accuracy and 1000&#215;&#160;higher powerefficiency than a&#160;graphics processing unit.








Abstract
Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in memristors based on transition metal oxide are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a titanium oxide (TiOx)&#8208;based interface&#8208;type dynamic memristor and an niobium oxide (NbOx)&#8208;based Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spike&#8208;firing soma, respectively, to construct a dendritic neuron unit for realizing high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Further, a dendritic neural network is hardware&#8208;implemented for spatial&#8208;temporal information processing to highlight the computational advantages achieved by incorporating dendritic functions in the network. Human motion recognition is demonstrated using the Nanyang Technological University&#8208;Red Green Blue&#160;(NTU&#8208;RGB) dataset as a benchmark spatial&#8208;temporal task; it shows a nearly 20% improvement in accuracy for the memristors&#8208;based hardware incorporating dendrites and a 1000&#215; advantage in power efficiency compared to that of the graphics processing unit (GPU). The dendritic neuron developed in this study can be considered a critical building block for implementing more bio&#8208;plausible neural networks that can manage complex spatial&#8208;temporal tasks with high efficiency.

The paradigm of in&#8208;sensor computing integrates computing functions into sensory networks, exhibiting high speed, energy efficiency, and computation throughout. The hardware implementation of in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm at the device and array levels, and their integration technology are discussed, and perspectives on future development of in&#8208;sensor computing are provided.








Abstract
The number of sensor nodes in the Internet of Things is growing rapidly, leading to a large volume of data generated at sensory terminals. Frequent data transfer between the sensors and computing units causes severe limitations on the system performance in terms of energy efficiency, speed, and security. To efficiently process a substantial amount of sensory data, a novel computation paradigm that can integrate computing functions into sensor networks should be developed. The in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm reduces data transfer and also decreases the high computing complexity by processing data locally. Here, the hardware implementation of the in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm at the device and array levels is discussed. The physical mechanisms that lead to unique sensory response characteristics and their corresponding computing functions are illustrated. In particular, bioinspired device characteristics enable the implementation of the functionalities of neuromorphic computation. The integration technology is also discussed and the perspective on the future development of in&#8208;sensor computing is provided.

         <title>Probabilistic Neural Computing with Stochastic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern computing assumes that materials, devices, and circuits will be operated in a fully deterministic manner, providing predictable and reliable outputs, with any desired random behavior re&#8208;introduced in software. This perspective describes how the integration of tunable stochastic devices into neuromorphic computing architectures can allow future microelectronics to enable more efficient probabilistic computing calculations for scientific computing and artificial&#8208;intelligence applications.








Abstract
The brain has effectively proven a powerful inspiration for the development of computing architectures in which processing is tightly integrated with memory, communication is event&#8208;driven, and analog computation can be performed at scale. These neuromorphic systems increasingly show an ability to improve the efficiency and speed of scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications. Herein, it is proposed that the brain's ubiquitous stochasticity represents an additional source of inspiration for expanding the reach of neuromorphic computing to probabilistic applications. To date, many efforts exploring probabilistic computing have focused primarily on one scale of the microelectronics stack, such as implementing probabilistic algorithms on deterministic hardware or developing probabilistic devices and circuits with the expectation that they will be leveraged by eventual probabilistic architectures. A co&#8208;design vision is described by which large numbers of devices, such as magnetic tunnel junctions and tunnel diodes, can be operated in a stochastic regime and incorporated into a scalable neuromorphic architecture that can impact a number of probabilistic computing applications, such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian neural networks. Finally, a framework is presented to categorize increasingly advanced hardware&#8208;based probabilistic computing technologies.

         <dc:description>
Unlike two&#8208;terminal memristors, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) tunes conductance through ion injection into the channel through a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the challenging fundamental questions, and how ECRAM could be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low power neuromorphic computing are reviewed.








Abstract
Non&#8208;von&#8208;Neumann computing using neuromorphic systems based on two&#8208;terminal resistive nonvolatile memory elements has emerged as a promising approach, but its full potential has not been realized due to the lack of materials and devices with the appropriate attributes. Unlike memristors, which require large write currents to drive phase transformations or filament growth, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) decouples the &#8220;write&#8221; and &#8220;read&#8221; operations using a &#8220;gate&#8221; electrode to tune the conductance state through charge&#8208;transfer reactions, and every electron transferred through the external circuit in ECRAM corresponds to the migration of &#8776;1 ion used to store analogue information. Like static dopants in traditional semiconductors, electrochemically inserted ions modulate the conductivity by locally perturbing a host's electronic structure; however, ECRAM does so in a dynamic and reversible manner. The resulting change in conductance can span orders of magnitude, from gradual increments needed for analog elements, to large, abrupt changes for dynamically reconfigurable adaptive architectures. In this in&#8208;depth perspective, the history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the rich portfolio of challenging, fundamental questions, and how ECRAM can be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing are discussed.

         <title>Energy and Space Efficient Parallel Adder Using Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest functional crossbars incorporating molecular materials to date are fabricated, in which all the memristors are consistent, robust, and reliable. An 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders are experimentally demonstrated. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit adder with 268&#160;million inputs is simulated that outperformed a multicore complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) platform.








Abstract
A breakthrough in in&#8208;memory computing technologies hinges on the development of appropriate material platforms that can overcome their existing limitations, such as larger than optimal footprint and multiple serial computational steps, with potential accumulation of errors. Using a molecular switching element with multiple non&#8208;monotonic and deterministic transitions, the device count and the number of computational steps can be substantially reduced. With molecular materials, however, the realization of a reliable and robust platform is&#160;an unattained goal for decades. Here, crossbar arrays with up to 64 molecular memristors are fabricated to experimentally demonstrate 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders&#160;that operate for thousands of measurement cycles with an estimated error probability of 10&#8722;16. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit parallel adder is designed and simulated with 268&#160;million inputs including contributions from the peripheral circuitry showing a 47&#215; higher energy efficiency, 93&#215; faster operation, and 9% of the footprint, leading to 4390 times improved energy&#8211;delay product compared to a special purpose complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;based multicore adder.

&lt;p&gt;The largest functional crossbars incorporating molecular materials to date are fabricated, in which all the memristors are consistent, robust, and reliable. An 8-bit serial and 4-bit parallel adders are experimentally demonstrated. For performance benchmarking, a 32-bit adder with 268&#160;million inputs is simulated that outperformed a multicore complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) platform.

         <title>Mechanism and Impact of Bipolar Current Voltage Asymmetry in Computational Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonvolatile memristive memory devices are emerging computational blocks for brain&#8208;inspired and in&#8208;memory computing. Using examples of phase&#8208;change memory, it is shown that there is a previously overlooked non&#8208;ideality of the bias&#8208;polarity&#8208;dependent current flow that can impact the numerical computational precision achievable for useful matrix&#8208;vector multiplication operations.








Abstract
Nanoscale resistive memory devices are being explored for neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing. However, non&#8208;ideal device characteristics of read noise and resistance drift pose significant challenges to the achievable computational precision. Here, it is shown that there is an additional non&#8208;ideality that can impact computational precision, namely the bias&#8208;polarity&#8208;dependent current flow. Using phase&#8208;change memory (PCM) as a model system, it is shown that this &#8220;current&#8211;voltage&#8221; non&#8208;ideality arises both from the material and geometrical properties of the devices. Further, we&#160;discuss the detrimental effects of such bipolar asymmetry on in&#8208;memory matrix&#8208;vector multiply (MVM) operations and provide a scheme to compensate for&#160;it.

         <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Memory Devices Using Ultrafast, Non&#8208;Volatile Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated photonic memory based on a novel phase&#8208;change material&#8212;namely, Sc0.2Sb2Te3 (SST)&#8212;showing distinct optical contrast between two stable phases, amorphous and crystalline states is reported. Using an optical pulse as fast as 2 ns, information can be written and erased in the photonic memory. This ultrafast photonic memory has enormous application potential in photonic computing and neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
The search for ultrafast photonic memory devices is inspired by the ever&#8208;increasing number of cloud&#8208;computing, supercomputing, and artificial&#8208;intelligence applications, together with the unique advantages of signal processing in the optical domain such as high speed, large bandwidth, and low energy consumption. By embracing silicon photonics with chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), non&#8208;volatile integrated photonic memory is developed with promising potential in photonic integrated circuits and nanophotonic applications. While conventional PCMs suffer from slow crystallization speed, scandium&#8208;doped antimony telluride (SST) has been recently developed for ultrafast phase&#8208;change random&#8208;access memory applications. An ultrafast non&#8208;volatile photonic memory based on an SST thin film with a 2 ns write/erase speed is demonstrated, which is the fastest write/erase speed ever reported in integrated phase&#8208;change photonic devices. SST&#8208;based photonic memories exhibit multilevel capabilities and good stability at room temperature. By mapping the memory level to the biological synapse weight, an artificial neural network based on photonic memory devices is successfully established for image classification. Additionally, a reflective nanodisplay application using SST with optoelectronic modulation capabilities is demonstrated. Both the optical and electrical changes in SST during the phase transition and the fast&#8208;switching speed demonstrate their potential for use in photonic computing, neuromorphic computing, nanophotonics, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Molecular Interactions in a Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By maneuvering the supramolecular dynamics in a molecular memristor, a wide variation of functionalities starting from diode and passing between nonvolatile and volatile, unipolar and bipolar memristors with sharp and gradual transitions within a single circuit element is captured. A mathematical design space evolves thereof that can enable almost all possible characteristic variations, desirable in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Electronic transitions in molecular&#8208;circuit elements hinge on complex interactions between molecules and ions, offering a multidimensional parameter space to embed, access, and optimize material functionalities for target&#8208;specific applications. This opportunity is not cultivated in molecular memristors because their low&#8208;temperature charge transport, which is a route to decipher molecular many&#8208;body interactions, is unexplored. To address this, robust, temperature&#8208;resilient molecular memristors based on a Ru complex of an azo aromatic ligand are designed, and current&#8211;voltage sweep measurements from room temperature down to 2 K with different cooling protocols are performed. By freezing out or activating different components of supramolecular dynamics, the local Coulombic interactions between the molecules and counterions that affect the electronic transport can be controlled. Operating conditions are designed where functionalities spanning bipolar, unipolar, nonvolatile, and volatile memristors with sharp as well as gradual analog transitions are captured within a single device. A mathematical design space evolves, thereof comprising 36 tuneable parameters in which all possible steady&#8208;state functional variations in a memristor characteristic can be attainable. This enables a deterministic design route to engineer neuromorphic devices with unprecedented control over the transformation characteristics governing their functional flexibility and tunability.

         <title>Diffusive Memristors with Uniform and Tunable Relaxation Time for Spike Generation in Event&#8208;Based Pattern Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive memristors with highly uniform and widely tunable relaxation time are demonstrated. The dynamic relaxation behavior of such diffusive memristors is used as exponential decay kernels to implement the hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm for high&#8208;accuracy event&#8208;based pattern recognition.








Abstract
A diffusive memristor is a promising building block for brain&#8208;inspired computing hardware. However, the randomness in the device relaxation dynamics limits the wide&#8208;range adoption of diffusive memristors in large arrays. In this work, the device stack is engineered to achieve a much&#8208;improved uniformity in the relaxation time (standard deviation &#963; reduced from &#8776;12 to &#8776;0.32&#160;ms). The memristor is further connected with a resistor or a capacitor and the relaxation time is tuned between 1.13 &#181;s and 1.25&#160;ms, ranging from three orders of magnitude. The hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, to utilize the tunable and uniform relaxation behavior for spike generation, is implemented. An accuracy of 77.3% is achieved in recognizing moving objects in the neuromorphic MNIST (N&#8208;MNIST) dataset. The work paves the way for building emerging neuromorphic computing hardware systems with ultralow power consumption.

         <title>One&#8208;Phototransistor&#8211;One&#8208;Memristor Array with High&#8208;Linearity Light&#8208;Tunable Weight for Optic Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor array is proposed that works as an artificial optic neural network for image recognition. The device shows highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable conductance weight during the online training process of the optic artificial neural network and yields a recognition accuracy of 99.33% after only ten training epochs, indicating the potential in highly efficient optic neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy&#8208;efficient artificial&#8208;vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross&#8208;talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, a highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable, cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free, and silicon&#8208;compatible one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor is experimentally demonstrated for the implementation of an optic artificial neural network (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment, an OANN is constructed using a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it is trained on an online platform. The model yields an accuracy of 99.3% after only ten training epochs. The 1PT1R memristor, which shows good performance, demonstrates its ability as an excellent hardware solution for highly efficient optic neuromorphic and edge computing.

         <title>An Aqueous Analog MAC Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 16 &#215; 16 array of ionic transistors that electrochemically functions in aqueous quinone solution is reported. It executes analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This demonstrates the use of ions in the aqueous milieu for analog computing is a step toward developing a more complex bioinspired information processing platforms.








Abstract
Using ions in aqueous milieu for signal processing, like in biological circuits, may potentially lead to a bioinspired information processing platform. Studies, however, have focused on individual ionic diodes and transistors rather than circuits comprising many such devices. Here a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of new ionic transistors is developed in an aqueous quinone solution. Each transistor features a concentric ring electrode pair with a disk electrode at the center. The electrochemistry of these electrodes in the solution provides the basis for the transistor operation. The ring pair electrochemically tunes the local electrolytic concentration to modulate the disk's Faradaic reaction rate. Thus, the disk current as a Faradaic reaction to the disk voltage is gated by the ring pair. The 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of these transistors performs analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This exploits the transistor's operating regime where the disk current is a multiplication of the disk voltage and a weight parameter tuned by the ring pair gating. Such disk currents from multiple transistors are summated in a global reference electrode to complete a MAC task. This ionic circuit demonstrating analog computing is a step toward sophisticated aqueous ionics.

         <title>Reservoir Computing with Charge&#8208;Trap Memory Based on a MoS2 Channel for Neuromorphic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a&#160;charge&#8208;trap memory (CTM) based on MoS2 where the memory operation arises thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. The CTM device displays synaptic potentiation/depression induced by pulses applied to the gate or drain terminal with excellent linearity. The synaptic characteristics are used in a reservoir computing system for visual pattern recognition, which makes MoS2&#8208;based CT emerge as one of the most promising technologies&#160;for neuromorphic engineering.








Abstract
Novel memory devices are essential for developing low power, fast, and accurate in&#8208;memory computing and neuromorphic engineering concepts that can compete with the conventional complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS) digital processors. 2D semiconductors provide a novel platform for advanced semiconductors with atomic thickness, low&#8208;current operation, and capability of 3D integration. This work presents a charge&#8208;trap memory (CTM) device with a MoS2 channel where memory operation arises, thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. Transistor operation, memory characteristics, and synaptic potentiation/depression for neuromorphic applications are demonstrated. The CTM device shows outstanding linearity of the potentiation by applied drain pulses of equal amplitude. Finally, pattern recognition is demonstrated by reservoir computing where the input pattern is applied as a stimulation of the MoS2&#8208;based CTMs, while the output current after stimulation is processed by a feedforward readout network. The good accuracy, the low current operation, and the robustness to input random bit flip makes the CTM device a promising technology for future high&#8208;density neuromorphic computing concepts.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Thermal Characterization of Dynamical VO2 Memristors via Local Activity Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact model connecting measurable material properties and device dimensions to circuit behavior of locally active memristors is presented, thus enabling rapid screening of neuromorphic materials for desired applications.








Abstract
Translating the surging interest in neuromorphic electronic components, such as those based on nonlinearities near Mott transitions, into large&#8208;scale commercial deployment faces steep challenges in the current lack of means to identify and design key material parameters. These issues are exemplified by the difficulties in connecting measurable material properties to device behavior via circuit element models. Here, the principle of local activity is used to build a model of VO2/SiN Mott threshold switches by sequentially accounting for constraints from a minimal set of quasistatic and dynamic electrical and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal data obtained via in situ thermoreflectance mapping. By combining independent data sets for devices with varying dimensions, the model is distilled to measurable material properties, and device scaling laws are established. The model can accurately predict electrical and thermal conductivities and capacitances and locally active dynamics (especially persistent spiking self&#8208;oscillations). The systematic procedure by which this model is developed has been a missing link in predictively connecting neuromorphic device behavior with their underlying material properties, and should enable rapid screening of material candidates before employing expensive manufacturing processes and testing procedures.

         <title>Memristive Field&#8208;Programmable Analog Arrays for Analog Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) is the analog counterpart of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). FPAA can be used to quickly prototyping analog circuit designs and greatly enhance analog computing development. A memristor based FPAA (memFPAA) has been demonstrated in this work with memristive devices and arrays serving as multiple core analog components, ranging from programmable analog resistors, routing networks, and analog vector&#8208;matrix multipliers.








Abstract
The increasing interests in analog computing nowadays call for multipurpose analog computing platforms with reconfigurability. The advancement of analog computing, enabled by novel electronic elements like memristors, has shown its potential to sustain the exponential growth of computing demand in the new era of analog data deluge. Here, a platform of a memristive field&#8208;programmable analog array (memFPAA) is experimentally demonstrated with memristive devices serving as a variety of core analog elements and CMOS components as peripheral circuits. The memFPAA is reconfigured to implement a first&#8208;order band pass filter, an audio equalizer, and an acoustic mixed frequency classifier, as application examples. The memFPAA, featured with programmable analog memristors, memristive routing networks, and memristive vector&#8208;matrix multipliers, opens opportunities for fast prototyping analog designs as well as efficient analog applications in signal processing and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Tunable Intervalence Charge Transfer in Ruthenium Prussian Blue Analog Enables Stable and Efficient Biocompatible Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyanide&#8208;linked ruthenium coordination framework undergoes a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold change in electronic conductivity in response to electrochemical charging or redox reaction with dopamine, enabling battery&#8208;transistor synaptic nonvolatile memory devices that switch via electrical impulses or dopamine reaction. (Electro)chemically tunable mixed valence states dictate the degree of electron delocalization.








Abstract
Emerging concepts for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and brain&#8208;computer interfacing inspire new research avenues aimed at understanding the relationship between oxidation state and conductivity in unexplored materials. This report expands the materials playground for neuromorphic devices to include a mixed valence inorganic 3D coordination framework, a ruthenium Prussian blue analog (RuPBA), for flexible and biocompatible artificial synapses that reversibly switch conductance by more than four orders of magnitude based on electrochemically tunable oxidation state. The electrochemically tunable degree of mixed valency and electronic coupling between N&#8208;coordinated Ru sites controls the carrier concentration and mobility, as supported by density functional theory computations and application of electron transfer theory to in situ spectroscopy of intervalence charge transfer. Retention of programmed states is improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to extensively studied organic polymers, thus reducing the frequency, complexity, and energy costs associated with error correction schemes. This report demonstrates dopamine&#8208;mediated plasticity of RuPBA synapses and biocompatibility of RuPBA with neuronal cells, evoking prospective application for brain&#8208;computer interfacing.

Neuromorphic Computing
Programmable analog memories based on emerging materials enable neuromorphic circuits capable of growing like biological intelligent systems. In the near future, such neuromorphic circuits implemented with nonvolatile static memories are expected to be able to accelerate machine&#8208;learning algorithms with much improved energy efficiency and throughput over traditional digital systems. In the long run, these neuromorphic circuits implemented with dynamic memristors may eventually realize mortal computers.

Probabilistic Neuromorphic Computing
Unlike modern computers that are engineered to be fully deterministic, the brain leverages stochasticity at immense scales to achieve energy&#8208;efficient intelligence. In article number 2204569, Shashank Misra, James B. Aimone, and co&#8208;workers describe how the incorporation of materials and devices that exhibit stochastic behaviors into brain&#8208;inspired circuits can enable neuromorphic systems that natively perform probabilistic computations.

Designing artificial neurons and synapses with on demand properties is considered crucial for the development of new&#8208;type hardware for the future neuromorphic computing. This review discusses the common electrochemical fundamentals between biological and redox&#8208;based memristive cells and the ways to control and tune the device functionalities. Examples on recent achievements in the array implementation of these systems are provided.








Abstract
Artificial neurons and synapses are considered essential for the progress of the future brain&#8208;inspired computing, based on beyond von Neumann architectures. Here, a discussion on the common electrochemical fundamentals of biological and artificial cells is provided, focusing on their similarities with the redox&#8208;based memristive devices. The driving forces behind the functionalities and the ways to control them by an electrochemical&#8208;materials approach are presented. Factors such as the chemical symmetry of the electrodes, doping of the solid electrolyte, concentration gradients, and excess surface energy are discussed as essential to understand, predict, and design artificial neurons and synapses. A variety of two&#8208; and three&#8208;terminal memristive devices and memristive architectures are presented and their application for solving various problems is shown. The work provides an overview of the current understandings on the complex processes of neural signal generation and transmission in both biological and artificial cells and presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications, including signal transmission between biological and artificial cells. This example is showcasing the possibility for creating bioelectronic interfaces and integrating artificial circuits in biological systems. Prospectives and challenges of the modern technology toward low&#8208;power, high&#8208;information&#8208;density circuits are highlighted.

         <title>Complex Oxides for Brain&#8208;Inspired Computing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computers inspired by the brain offer the exciting prospect of energy efficiency. Complex oxides can serve as building blocks for brain&#8208;inspired computing owing to their adaptive electronic structure and high sensitivity to environmental stimuli.








Abstract
The fields of brain&#8208;inspired computing, robotics, and, more broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) seek to implement knowledge gleaned from the natural world into human&#8208;designed electronics and machines. In this review, the opportunities presented by complex oxides, a class of electronic ceramic materials whose properties can be elegantly tuned by doping, electron interactions, and a variety of external stimuli near room temperature, are discussed. The review begins with a discussion of natural intelligence at the elementary level in the nervous system, followed by collective intelligence and learning at the animal colony level mediated by social interactions. An important aspect highlighted is the vast spatial and temporal scales involved in learning and memory. The focus then turns to collective phenomena, such as metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions (MITs), ferroelectricity, and related examples, to highlight recent demonstrations of artificial neurons, synapses, and circuits and their learning. First&#8208;principles theoretical treatments of the electronic structure, and in situ synchrotron spectroscopy of operating devices are then discussed. The implementation of the experimental characteristics into neural networks and algorithm design is then revewed. Finally, outstanding materials challenges that require a microscopic understanding of the physical mechanisms, which will be essential for advancing the frontiers of neuromorphic computing, are highlighted.

         <title>Compute in&#8208;Memory with Non&#8208;Volatile Elements for Neural Networks: A Review from a Co&#8208;Design Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep learning drives an increasing demand on compute resources. A key operation, matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplication, can potentially be accelerated using cross&#8208;bar interconnects with nodal non&#8208;volatile memory. However, its application today is limited by the properties of the memory elements. Taking a co&#8208;design view, this review addresses the interdependencies of materials and architecture for such cross&#8208;bar hardware for training and inference.








Abstract
Deep learning has&#160;become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from compute&#8208;unit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a cross&#8208;bar architecture with nodal non&#8208;volatile&#8208;memory elements that performs an analog multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate operation, enabling the matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplications repeatedly used in all neural network workloads. The memory materials can significantly influence final system&#8208;level characteristics and chip performance, including speed, power, and classification accuracy. With an over&#8208;arching co&#8208;design viewpoint, this review assesses the use of cross&#8208;bar based CIM for neural networks, connecting the material properties and the associated design constraints and demands to application, architecture, and performance. Both digital and analog memory are considered, assessing the status for training and inference, and providing metrics for the collective set of properties non&#8208;volatile memory materials will need to demonstrate for a successful CIM technology.

         <title>Artificial Neuronal Devices Based on Emerging Materials: Neuronal Dynamics and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the latest research progress on artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials. The neuronal dynamics demonstrated in these devices, the hardware implementation of various artificial neural networks, and their potentials in computational and sensing applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Artificial neuronal devices are critical building blocks of neuromorphic computing systems and currently the subject of intense research motivated by application needs from new computing technology and more realistic brain emulation. Researchers have proposed a range of device concepts that can mimic neuronal dynamics and functions. Although the switching physics and device structures of these artificial neurons are largely different, their behaviors can be described by several neuron models in a more unified manner. In this paper, the reports of artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials are reviewed from the perspective of the demonstrated neuron models, with a focus on the neuronal functions implemented in these devices and the exploitation of these functions for computational and sensing applications. Furthermore, the neuroscience inspirations and engineering methods to enrich the neuronal dynamics that remain to be implemented in artificial neuronal devices and networks toward realizing the full functionalities of biological neurons are discussed.

         <title>Thermal Management in Neuromorphic Materials, Devices, and Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current state of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology is described and the challenges and opportunities of energy efficient implementation of neuromorphic devices are addressed. The fundamental features of the brain's thermal regulation and their further physical implementation are discussed. It is believed that the underlined importance of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology will guide researchers in this field.








Abstract
Machine learning has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, often referred to as an &#8220;artificial intelligence revolution.&#8221; Biological systems inspire the fundamental approach for this new computing paradigm: using neural networks to classify large amounts of data into sorting categories. Current machine&#8208;learning schemes implement simulated neurons and synapses on standard computers based on a von Neumann architecture. This approach is inefficient in energy consumption, and thermal management, motivating the search for hardware&#8208;based systems that imitate the brain. Here, the present state of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology and the challenges and opportunities of the energy&#8208;efficient implementation of neuromorphic devices are considered. The main features of brain&#8208;inspired computing and quantum materials for implementing neuromorphic devices are briefly described, the brain criticality and resistive switching&#8208;based neuromorphic devices are discussed, the energy and electrical considerations for spiking&#8208;based computation are presented, the fundamental features of the brain's thermal regulation are addressed, the physical mechanisms for thermal management and thermoelectric control of materials and neuromorphic devices are analyzed, and challenges and new avenues for implementing energy&#8208;efficient computing are described.

         <title>Electrochemical Ionic Synapses: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical ionic synapses (EISs) are programmable resistors whose conductivity is controlled deterministically by electrochemical charge insertion. Their repeatable conductance modulation and low energy consumption render them promising for enabling analog deep learning architectures with uncompromised accuracy and superior energy efficiency. Here, we&#160;present the progress on EIS devices in the field, a physical model to provide guidelines for targeted material properties, and strategies for further advancing these devices.








Abstract
Artificial neural networks based on crossbar arrays of analog programmable resistors can address the high energy challenge of conventional hardware in artificial intelligence applications. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art two&#8208;terminal resistive switching devices based on conductive filament formation suffer from high variability and poor controllability. Electrochemical ionic synapses are three&#8208;terminal devices that operate by electrochemical and dynamic insertion/extraction of ions that control the electronic conductivity of a channel in a single solid&#8208;solution phase. They are promising candidates for programmable resistors in crossbar arrays because they have shown uniform and deterministic control of electronic conductivity based on ion doping, with very low energy consumption. Here, the desirable specifications of these programmable resistors are presented. Then, an overview of the current progress of devices based on Li+, O2&#8722;, and H+ ions and material systems is provided. Achieving nanosecond speed, low operation voltage (&#8776;1&#160;V), low energy consumption, with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor compatibility all simultaneously remains a challenge. Toward this goal, a physical model of the device is constructed to provide guidelines for the desired material properties to overcome the remaining challenges. Finally, an outlook is provided, including strategies to advance materials toward the desirable properties and the future opportunities for electrochemical ionic synapses.

         <title>Optical Memory, Switching, and Neuromorphic Functionality in Metal Halide Perovskite Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically addressable neuromorphic devices and systems are proposed as alternatives for next&#8208;generation visual perception applications. This review covers recent progress toward memory and neuromorphic functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and neuromorphic functionality.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite based materials have emerged over the past few decades as remarkable solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic materials with many intriguing properties and potential applications. These emerging materials have recently been considered for their promise in low&#8208;energy memory and information processing applications. In particular, their large optical cross&#8208;sections, high photoconductance contrast, large carrier&#8208;diffusion lengths, and mixed electronic/ionic transport mechanisms are attractive for enabling memory elements and neuromorphic devices that are written and/or read in the optical domain. Here, recent progress toward memory and neuromorphic functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and neuromorphic functionality is reviewed.

         <title>From Ferroelectric Material Optimization to Neuromorphic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>

Ferroelectric materials combine a voltage driven switching mechanism with nonvolatility making them promising for nonvolatile devices. Here the material basics and the three different memory devices are described as a starting point for an in&#8208;depth discussion of the current status of implementing ferroelectric devices for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Due to the voltage driven switching at low voltages combined with nonvolatility of the achieved polarization state, ferroelectric materials have a unique potential for low power nonvolatile electronic devices. The competitivity of such devices is hindered by compatibility issues of well&#8208;known ferroelectrics with established semiconductor technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide changed this situation. The natural application of nonvolatile devices is as a memory cell. Nonvolatile memory devices also built the basis for other applications like in&#8208;memory or neuromorphic computing. Three different basic ferroelectric devices can be constructed: ferroelectric capacitors, ferroelectric field effect transistors and ferroelectric tunneling junctions. In this article first the material science of the ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide will be summarized with a special focus on tailoring the switching characteristics towards different applications.The current status of nonvolatile ferroelectric memories then lays the ground for looking into applications like in&#8208;memory computing. Finally, a special focus will be given to showcase how the basic building blocks of spiking neural networks, the neuron and the synapse, can be realized and how they can be combined to realize neuromorphic computing systems. A summary, comparison with other technologies like resistive switching devices and an outlook completes the paper.

         <title>Harnessing the Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition of VO2 in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
VO2 manifests a remarkable metal&#8211;insulator transition that affords the nonlinear, dynamical response needed to emulate the function of biological neurons and synapses. Neuromorphic function is tunable through site&#8208;selective modification, stress, tuning of interfaces, and modification of external circuit elements. Strategies for modulating transformation characteristics are reviewed and inverse design approaches across decades of length and time scales are outlined.








Abstract
Future&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing seeks to overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures by colocating logic and memory functions, thereby emulating the function of neurons and synapses in the human brain. Despite remarkable demonstrations of high&#8208;fidelity neuronal emulation, the predictive design of neuromorphic circuits starting from knowledge of material transformations remains challenging. VO2 is an attractive candidate since it manifests a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature, discontinuous, and hysteretic metal&#8211;insulator transition. The transition provides a nonlinear dynamical response to input signals, as needed to construct neuronal circuit elements. Strategies for tuning the transformation characteristics of VO2 based on modification of material properties, interfacial structure, and field couplings, are discussed. Dynamical modulation of transformation characteristics through in situ processing is discussed as a means of imbuing synaptic function. Mechanistic understanding of site&#8208;selective modification; external, epitaxial, and chemical strain; defect dynamics; and interfacial field coupling in modifying local atomistic structure, the implications therein for electronic structure, and ultimately, the tuning of transformation characteristics, is emphasized. Opportunities are highlighted for inverse design and for using design principles related to thermodynamics and kinetics of electronic transitions learned from VO2 to inform the design of new Mott materials, as well as to go beyond energy&#8208;efficient computation to manifest intelligence.

         <title>Spotlight on Luminescence Thermometry: Basics, Challenges, and Cutting&#8208;Edge Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest emerging trends of luminescence (nano)thermometry are reviewed from a perspective that has not been considered so far. The theoretical framework covering ratiometric and lifetime&#8208;based luminescent thermometers, recommendable standardization practices, reliability, and reproducibility, as well as the advancing use of algorithms for thermal readout improvement are discussed. These backgrounds are complemented by cutting&#8208;edge applications, current challenges, and future directions.








Abstract
Luminescence (nano)thermometry is a remote sensing technique that relies on the temperature dependency of the luminescence features (e.g., bandshape, peak energy or intensity, and excited state lifetimes and risetimes) of a phosphor to measure temperature. This technique provides precise thermal readouts with superior spatial resolution in short acquisition times. Although luminescence thermometry is just starting to become a more mature subject, it exhibits enormous potential in several areas, e.g., optoelectronics, photonics, micro&#8208; and nanofluidics, and nanomedicine. This work reviews the latest trends in the field, including the establishment of a comprehensive theoretical background and standardized practices. The reliability, repeatability, and reproducibility of the technique are also discussed, along with the use of multiparametric analysis and artificial&#8208;intelligence algorithms to enhance thermal readouts. In addition, examples are provided to underscore the challenges that luminescence thermometry faces, alongside the need for a continuous search and design of new materials, experimental techniques, and analysis procedures to improve the competitiveness, accessibility, and popularity of the technology

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow via Phosphorescence F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband organic afterglow materials are achieved via a phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process by the combination of the long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donor and narrowband emission feature of the fluorescence acceptor. The resulting materials exhibit high color purity and multicolor narrowband afterglow, demonstrating potential in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and instant information identification.








Abstract
Achieving multicolor organic afterglow materials with narrowband emission and high color purity is important in various optoelectronic fields but remains a great challenge. Here, an efficient strategy is presented to obtain narrowband organic afterglow materials via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donors to narrowband fluorescence acceptors in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The resulting materials exhibit narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) as small as 23&#160;nm and the longest lifetime of 721.22&#160;ms. Meanwhile, by pairing the appropriate donors and acceptors, multicolor and high color purity afterglow ranging from green to red with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67.1% are achieved. Moreover, given their long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and flexibility, the potential applications are demonstrated in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and dynamic and quick information identification in low&#8208;light conditions. This work provides a facile approach for developing multicolor and narrowband afterglow materials as well as expands the features of organic afterglow.

         <title>Achieving Superior Tensile Performance in Individual Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Crystals</title>

The single&#8208;crystal tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework nanobelts are found to exhibit unprecedented mechanical properties beyond theoretical limits and the origins of these mechanical properties are revealed by simulations.








Abstract
Rapid advances in the engineering application prospects of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) materials necessitate an urgent in&#8208;depth understanding of their mechanical properties. This work demonstrates unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni&#8208;TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength&#8208;to&#8208;Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8776;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first&#8208;principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. The investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nanoelectromechanical devices.

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Transistor Immunosensor with Highly Selective Multiparametric Detection of Anti&#8208;Drug Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor immunosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO&#8208;EGT) for the detection of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ATIs) against the drug Infliximab is reported. The multiparametric analysis of the immunosensor response, with a theoretical limit of detection of 10 am, allows for the discrimination between ATIs and interfering agents.








Abstract
The advent of immunotherapies with biological drugs has revolutionized the treatment of cancers and auto&#8208;immune diseases. However, in some patients, the production of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ADAs) hampers the drug efficacy. The concentration of ADAs is typically in the range of 1&#8211;10 pm; hence their immunodetection is challenging. ADAs toward Infliximab (IFX), a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other auto&#8208;immune diseases, are focussed. An ambipolar electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor (EGT) immunosensor is reported based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) channel and IFX bound to the gate electrode as the specific probe. The rGO&#8208;EGTs are easy to fabricate and exhibit low voltage operations (&#8804; 0.3&#160;V), a robust response within 15&#160;min, and ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (10 am limit of detection). A multiparametric analysis of the whole rGO&#8208;EGT transfer curves based on the type&#8208;I generalized extreme value distribution is proposed. It is demonstrated that it allows to selectively quantify ADAs also in the co&#8208;presence of its antagonist tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), the natural circulating target of IFX.

         <title>Diatomite&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Doped MoS2/Carbon Composites to Boost Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy to prepare SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C toward high&#8208;performance sodium storage is developed. Because of the hierarchical structure, high conductivity, and abundant active sites, SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity, high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrodes for energy conversion/storage because of the layered structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency. However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here, an ingenious diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C) composites toward the high&#8208;performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium&#8208;ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (&#8776;604.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density functional theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of synthesizing SACs on 2D TMDCs but also provides a crucial step toward the practical sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

&lt;p&gt;2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrodes for energy conversion/storage because of the layered structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency. However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here, an ingenious diatomite-templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single-atom cobalt-doped MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/carbon (SA Co-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C) composites toward the high-performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium-ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (&#8776;604.0 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium-ion full cell composed of SA Co-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C anode and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density functional theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of synthesizing SACs on 2D TMDCs but also provides a crucial step toward the practical sodium-ion battery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Engineering of a Se/Te Nanochaperone for Reinvigorating Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

A facile and universal method for synthesizing nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with well&#8208;controlled structure is reported. Dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs effectively facilitate radiotherapy by directly damaging tumor cells and shaping the tumor immuno&#8208;microenvironment, which endows&#160;combination treatment with great abscopal effects to combat distant tumor progression.








Abstract
Facilely synthesized nanoradiosensitizers with well&#8208;controlled structure and multifunctionality are greatly desired to address the challenges of cancer radiotherapy. In this work, a universal method is developed for synthesizing chalcogen&#8208;based TeSe nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with rod&#8208;, spindle&#8208;, or dumbbell&#8208;like morphologies by engineering the surfactant and added selenite. Interestingly, dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs (TeSe NDs) as chaperone exhibit better radio&#8208;sensitizing activities than the other two nanostructural shapes. Meanwhile, TeSe NDs can serve as cytotoxic chemodrugs that degrade to highly toxic metabolites in acidic environment and deplete GSH within tumor to facilitate radiotherapy. More importantly, the combination of TeSe NDs with radiotherapy significantly decreases regulatory T cells and M2&#8208;phenotype tumor&#8208;associated macrophage infiltrations within tumors to reshape the immunosuppressive microenvironment and induce robust T lymphocytes&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in great abscopal effects on combating distant tumor progression. This study provides a universal method for preparing NHJ with well&#8208;controlled structure and developing nanoradiosensitizers to overcome the clinical challenges of cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Acid and Hypoxia Tandem&#8208;Activatable Deep Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoprobe for Two&#8208;Step Signal Amplification and Early Detection of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>

A phosphorescent nanoprobe comprised of oxygen&#8208;sensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR)&#8208;emitting phosphorescence cores and acid&#8208;cleavable polyethene glycol (PEG) shells, that is ultrasensitive to tumor acidity and hypoxia. This tandem&#8208;activatable probe design specifically amplifies tumor signals and enables early tumor detection, the signal in deep NIR region promoting contrast and resolution of hypoxia imaging as well.








Abstract
The early detection of cancers can significantly change outcomes even with existing treatments. However, ~50% of cancers still cannot be detected until they reach an advanced stage, highlighting the great challenges in the early detection. Here, an ultrasensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR) nanoprobe that is successively responsive to tumor acidity and hypoxia is reported. It is demonstrated that the new nanoprobe specifically detects tumor hypoxia microenvironment based on deep NIR imaging in ten different types of tumor models using cancer cell lines and patient&#8208;tissue derived xenograft tumors. By combining the acidity and hypoxia specific two&#8208;step signal amplification with a deep NIR detection, the reported nanoprobe enables the ultrasensitive visualization of hundreds of tumor cells or small tumors with a size of 260&#160;&#181;m in whole&#8208;body imaging or 115&#160;&#181;m metastatic lesions in lung imaging. As a result, it reveals that tumor hypoxia can occur as early as the lesions contain only several hundred cancer cells.

         <title>Biomimetic Spun Silk Ionotronic Fibers for Intelligent Discrimination of Motions and Tactile Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by liquid crystal spinning of animal silks, the highly stretchable, tough, and resilient spun silk ionotronic fibers are prepared by dry spinning with nematic silk microfibril dope solution. They are further incorporated into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers to sort and recognize objects made of different materials.








Abstract
Innovation in the ionotronics field has significantly accelerated the development of ultraflexible devices and machines. However, it is still challenging to develop efficient ionotronic&#8208;based fibers with necessary stretchability, resilience, and conductivity due to inherent conflict in producing spinning dopes with both high polymer and ion concentrations and low viscosities. Inspired by the liquid crystalline spinning of animal silk, this study circumvents the inherent tradeoff in other spinning methods by dry spinning a nematic silk microfibril dope solution. The liquid crystalline texture allows the spinning dope to flow through the spinneret and form free&#8208;standing fibers under minimal external forces. The resultant silk&#8208;sourced ionotronic fibers (SSIFs) are highly stretchable, tough, resilient, and fatigue&#8208;resistant. These mechanical advantages ensure a rapid and recoverable electromechanical response of SSIFs to kinematic deformations. Further, the incorporation of SSIFs into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers provides outstanding stable and sensitive triboelectric response to precisely and sensitively perceive small pressures. Moreover, by implementing a combination of machine learning and Internet of Things techniques, the SSIFs can sort objects made of different materials. With these structural, processing, performance, and functional merits, the SSIFs prepared herein are expected to be applied in human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogel Electrolyte for All&#8208;Flexible Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolytes are systematically explored, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. The optimal hydrogel electrolytes endow the Zn metal anode with a superior cycling lifespan and demonstrate great potential in wearable electronics with all flexible features.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes are widely explored in Zn metal batteries for application in wearable electronics. While extensive studies have been conducted on optimizing the chemical structure and boosting the tensile elasticity, the mechanical stability of the hydrogel under repeated deformation is largely overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory performance at large cycling capacity. This work systematically analyzes the compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolyte, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. It shows that, on the premise of homogeneous Zn deposition, an improved anti&#8208;fatigue property is essential to achieve high&#8208;capacity Zn metal anodes. The optimal Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel electrolyte (C&#8208;PAMCS) exhibits an unprecedented lifespan of 1500&#160;h for Zn//Zn cells at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. The potential application of C&#8208;PAMCS is exemplified in all&#8208;flexible Zn&#8208;ion batteries enabled by a flexible current collector consisting of a Ag nanowires embedded elastomer. This study provides the rationale under hydrogel electrolyte engineering toward advanced Zn&#8208;ion battereis and the application in flexible devices.

         <dc:description>
A smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem with an siRNA&#8208;mediated regulation pathway that upregulates mRNA translation and enhances mRNA transfection is reported. The DNA&#8208;based nanosystem disassembles and releases siRNA and mRNA in response to intracellular stimuli and promotes ribosome biogenesis through intracellular glutathione depletion, which facilitates the mRNA delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is the prerequisite for the application of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics. In hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, such as macrophages, the effective transfection of mRNA remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, a smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem is reported containing ribosome biogenesis&#8208;promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers are copolymerized to form a nanoframework (NF), including N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as the skeleton and acrydite&#8208;DNA as the initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1&#8208;polyT and H2&#8208;siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8776;34&#160;&#176;C), the NF swells to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, the NF deswells to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in the NF responds to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA are released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down&#8208;regulates the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up&#8208;regulates the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. The nanosystem shows satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model. It is envisioned that the DNA&#8208;based nanosystem will provide a promising carrier to deliver mRNA in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells and promote the development of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;dimensional Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method is developed to effectively suppress the multiple nucleation behavior of the molecules and enhance the 2D growth of organic crystals. In consequence, wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer organic single crystals are successfully fabricated on the viscous liquid substrate. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the crystal exhibit high device performance with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
The success of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronics and optoelectronics relies heavily on the capability to fabricate semiconductor single&#8208;crystal wafers. However, the conventional epitaxial growth strategy for inorganic wafers is invalid for growing organic semiconductor single crystals due to the lack of lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial substrates and intricate nucleation behaviors, severely impeding the advancement of organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. Here, an anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method for wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D organic semiconductor single crystals is developed for the first time. The crystal seed is firmly anchored on the viscous liquid surface, ensuring the steady epitaxial growth of organic single crystals from the crystal seed. The atomically flat liquid surface effectively eliminates the disturbance from substrate defects and greatly enhances the 2D growth of organic crystals. Using this approach, a wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer bis(triethylsilythynyl)&#8208;anthradithphene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) single crystal is formed, yielding a breakthrough for organic field&#8208;effect transistors with a high reliable mobility up to 8.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an ultralow mobility variable coefficient of 8.9%. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate organic single&#8208;crystal wafers for high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Organic Photodetectors with a Solution&#8208;Processed Integration Circuit toward Ubiquitous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed integration circuit consisting of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency, an organic photoconductor, and an organic resistor is proposed to dramatically boost the photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling the accurate extraction of physiological information from the photoplethysmographic waveforms, which can promote the development of ubiquitous health monitoring.








Abstract
Organic photodetectors, as an emerging wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology, offer exciting opportunities for next&#8208;generation photonic healthcare electronics. However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution&#8208;processed integration circuit for health monitoring application is reported. Through creating an ideal metal&#8211;semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, solution&#8208;printed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are achieved with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermionic limit. Consequently, monolithic integration of the OFET with an organic photoconductor enables the remarkable amplification of photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by more than four orders of magnitude from 5.5 to 4.6 &#215; 105, which is able to meet the demand for accurately extracting physiological information from the PPG waveforms. This work offers an effective and versatile approach to greatly enhance the photodetector performance, promising to revolutionize health monitoring technologies.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Encoding Hydrogels With DNA to Control Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synthesis and photopatterning of hydrogels with multiple, discrete DNA domains, single&#8208;micron resolution spatial control is achieved over chemical composition and function. DNA's sequence specificity is used to reversibly tether DNA and direct protein attachment in patterned domains. Importantly, it is shown that reporter cells preferentially activate in regions of patterned hydrogels containing biomolecular signals.








Abstract
Patterning biomolecules in synthetic hydrogels offers routes to visualize and learn how spatially&#8208;encoded cues modulate cell behavior (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis). However, investigating the role of multiple, spatially defined biochemical cues within a single hydrogel matrix remains challenging because of the limited number of orthogonal bioconjugation reactions available for patterning. Herein, a method to pattern multiple oligonucleotide sequences in hydrogels using thiol&#8208;yne photochemistry is introduced. Rapid hydrogel photopatterning of hydrogels with micron resolution DNA features (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and control over DNA density are achieved over centimeter&#8208;scale areas using mask&#8208;free digital photolithography. Sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions are then used to reversibly tether biomolecules to patterned regions, demonstrating chemical control over individual patterned domains. Last, localized cell signaling is shown using patterned protein&#8211;DNA conjugates to selectively activate cells on patterned areas. Overall, this work introduces a synthetic method to achieve multiplexed micron resolution patterns of biomolecules onto hydrogel scaffolds, providing a platform to study complex spatially&#8208;encoded cellular signaling environments.

         <title>Less&#8208;Suture Vascular Anastomosis: Development of Alternative Protocols with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Wrapping, Transparent, Adhesive, and Elastic Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adhesive, hemostatic, transparent, and elastic films are developed in this study to be used in &#8220;less&#8208;suture anastomosis&#8221; for blood vessels. It extensively decreases the number of sutures for vascular anastomosis and overall surgical time to a life&#8208;saving level in both normal and coagulopathy animal models.








Abstract
Blood vessel anastomosis by suture is a life&#8208;saving, yet time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive operation. While suture&#8208;less alternatives utilizing clips or related devices are developed to address these shortcomings, suture anastomosis is still overwhelmingly used in most cases. In this study, practical &#8220;less&#8208;suture&#8221; strategies are proposed, rather than ideal &#8220;suture&#8208;less&#8221; methods, to reflect real&#8208;world clinical situations. In the case of rat artery (d = 0.64&#160;mm) anastomosis, the less&#8208;suture anastomosis involves the application of thin, adhesive, transparent, and self&#8208;wrapping films to the site. This surprisingly reduces the number of stitches required from ten (without films) to four (with films), saving 27&#160;min of operating time per vessel. Furthermore, the decreased number of stitches largely alleviates fibrosis&#8208;mediated wall&#8208;thickening. Thus, a less&#8208;suture strategy is particularly useful for anastomosis of multiple vessels in emergency conditions and small&#8208;diameter vessels.

In this study, practical &#8220;less-suture&#8221; strategies are proposed, rather than ideal &#8220;suture-less&#8221; methods, to reflect real-world clinical situations. In the case of rat artery (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.64&#160;mm) anastomosis, the less-suture anastomosis involves the application of thin, adhesive, transparent, and self-wrapping films to the site. This surprisingly reduces the number of stitches required from ten (without films) to four (with films), saving 27&#160;min of operating time per vessel. Furthermore, the decreased number of stitches largely alleviates fibrosis-mediated wall-thickening. Thus, a less-suture strategy is particularly useful for anastomosis of multiple vessels in emergency conditions and small-diameter vessels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Activation of Snap&#8208;Through Instability in Multi&#8208;Response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contact&#8208;induced topological transformation is leveraged to introduce a highly versatile multistable metamaterial capable of switching its mechanical response post fabrication. The authors demonstrate how the in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of snap&#8208;through instability enable to generate non&#8208;volatile mechanical logic operations and to reprogram energy dissipation.








Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post&#8208;fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on&#8208;the&#8208;fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.

         <title>Targeted Reprogramming of Vitamin B3 Metabolism as a Nanotherapeutic Strategy towards Chemoresistant Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) maintain cancer stem cell stemness and promote immunosuppression, leading to chemoresistance and immune escape. Gemini&#8208;like nanoparticles are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF reprogramming and cancer cell elimination. CAF&#8208;targeting nanoparticles transform CAFs into quiescent fibroblasts via a cascade of Vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling and thereby rehabilitate chemosensitivity and immune activation in chemoresistant breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer stem cell (CSC)&#8208;mediated chemoresistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, direct depletion of CAFs may increase cancer invasiveness and metastasis. As a generalized strategy against chemoresistant cancers, Gemini&#8208;like homotypic targeting nanoparticles (NPs) are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF transformation and cancer cell elimination. The CAF&#8208;targeted NPs couple vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming to epigenetic modulation of secreted pro&#8208;stemness and immunosuppressive factors, thereby diminishing CSC and suppressive immune cell populations to enhance cancer cell drug susceptibility and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. In mouse models of breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers that are resistant to their respective first&#8208;line chemotherapeutics, a single dose of hydrogel co&#8208;delivering the Gemini&#8208;like NPs can rehabilitate chemosensitivity, induce immune activation, and achieve tumor regression. Moreover, it stimulates robust T cell memory for long&#8208;term protection against tumor rechallenge. This study thus represents an innovative approach with broad applicability for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.

         <title>Tailored Lattice Compressive Strain of Pt&#8208;Skins by the L12&#8208;Pt3M Intermetallic Core for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong confinement effect induced by modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC effectively ensures the ultrasmall size of Pt&#8208;based intermetallics and enhances the durability of the catalyst. The strain of Pt skins imposed by intermetallic cores is tailored to optimize the adsorption properties of the catalyst for intermediates of oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in highly effective and durable oxygen reduction.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and unsatisfactory durability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are severely hindering the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, the lattice compressive strain of Pt&#8208;skins imposed by Pt&#8208;based intermetallic cores is tailored for highly effective ORR through the confinement effect of the activated nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (a&#8208;NPC). The modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC not only promote Pt&#8208;based intermetallics with ultrasmall size (average size of &lt;4&#160;nm), but also efficiently stabilizes intermetallic nanoparticles&#160;and sufficient exposure of active sites during the ORR process. The optimized catalyst (L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10) achieves excellent mass activity (1.72 A mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (3.49&#160;mA cmPt&#8722;2), which are 11&#8208; and 15&#8208;fold that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Besides, owing to the confinement effect of a&#8208;NPC and protection of Pt&#8208;skins, L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10 retains 98.1% mass activity after 30&#160;000 cycles, and even 95% for 100&#160;000 cycles, while Pt/C retains only 51.2% for 30&#160;000 cycles. Rationalized by density functional theory, compared with other metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, and Zn), L12&#8208;Pt3Co closer to the top of &#8220;volcano&#8221; induces a more suitable compressive strain and electronic structure on Pt&#8208;skin, leading to an optimal oxygen adsorption energy and a remarkable ORR performance.

         <title>Induction of Metabolic Reprogramming in Kidney by Singlet Diradical Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible nanoparticles are assembled from a diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene compound with a singlet diradical ground state. It is found that such nanoparticles can induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids by promoting fatty acid degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation under redox homeostasis with an increased level of glutathione.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic compounds with an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, namely singlet diradicals, have recently gained attention in the fields of organic electronics, photovoltaics, and spintronics owing to their unique electronic structures and properties. Notably, singlet diradicals exhibit tunable redox amphoterism, which makes them excellent redox&#8208;active materials for biomedical applications. However, the safety and therapeutic efficacy of singlet diradicals in biological systems have not yet been explored. Herein, the study presents a newly designed singlet diradical nanomaterial, diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene (BO&#8208;Ph), exhibiting low cytotoxicity in vitro, non&#8208;significant acute nephrotoxicity in vivo, and the ability to induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal that the metabolism of BO&#8208;Ph stimulates glutathione (GSH) synthesis and fatty acid degradation, increases the levels of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and carnitine cycles, and eventually boosts oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) under redox homeostasis. Benefits of BO&#8208;Ph&#8208;induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids include enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity and promoting mitochondrial function. The results of this study can facilitate the application of singlet diradical materials in the treatment of clinical conditions induced by mitochondrial abnormalities in kidney.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are produced via topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. The resultant a&#8208;CN layers possess a low density of 0.55 g cm&#8722;3 and a high sp3 C level of 35.7%. As a result, a very low dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz is achieved for the 310&#8208;nm&#8208;thickness a&#8208;CN film with a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8776;4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

         <title>Unique Chirality Selection in Neural Cells for D&#8208;Matrix Enabling Specific Manipulation of Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;matrix chirality enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival of neural cells by attenuating the interaction between cytoskeleton proteins and matrixes, subsequently activating JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways, while the proliferation and adhesion of non&#8208;neural cells are promoted on the L&#8208;matrix, which provides a specific method to universally manipulate neural cell behaviors with chiral biomaterial systems.








Abstract
Manipulating neural cell behaviors is a critical issue to various therapies for neurological diseases and damages, where matrix chirality has long been overlooked despite the proven adhesion and proliferation improvement of multiple non&#8208;neural cells by L&#8208;matrixes. Here, it is reported that the D&#8208;matrix chirality specifically enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival in four different types of neural cells, contrasting its inhibition in non&#8208;neural cells. This universal impact on neural cells is defined as &#8220;chirality selection for D&#8208;matrix&#8221; and is achieved through the activation of JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways by the cellular tension relaxation resulting from the weak interaction between D&#8208;matrix and cytoskeleton proteins, particularly actin. Also, D&#8208;matrix promotes sciatic nerve repair effectively, both with or without non&#8208;neural stem cell implantation, by improving the population, function, and myelination of autologous Schwann cells. D&#8208;matrix chirality, as a simple, safe, and effective microenvironment cue to specifically and universally manipulate neural cell behaviors, holds extensive application potential in addressing neurological issues such as nerve regeneration, neurodegenerative disease treatment, neural tumor targeting, and neurodevelopment.

         <title>A Recyclable Standalone Microporous Layer with Interpenetrating Network for Sustainable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes interpenetrating network is employed to prepare a standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with high strength and gas permeability. The high&#8208;performance standalone MPL can greatly extend the service lifetime of gas diffusion layers and reduce the costs of recovering catalyst coated membranes. Therefore, the standalone MPL is promising to significantly improve the sustainability of fuel cells.








Abstract
The commercialization of fuel cells inevitably brings recycling problems. Therefore, achieving high recyclability of fuel cells is particularly important for their sustainable development. In this work, a recyclable standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with interpenetrating network that can significantly enhance the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells is prepared. The interpenetrating network enables the standalone MPL to have high strength (17.7&#160;MPa), gas permeability (1.55&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;13&#160;m2), and fuel&#8208;cell performance (peak power density 1.35&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2), providing the basic guarantee for its application in high&#8208;performance and highly recyclable fuel cells. Additionally, the standalone MPL is highly adaptable to various gas&#8208;diffusion backings (GDBs), providing high possibility to select highly recyclable GDBs. Outstandingly, anode standalone MPLs and GDBs can be easily detached from the spent membrane electrode assembly (MEA). This not only saves &gt;90 vol% solvent in the recovery of the catalyst&#8208;coated membrane (CCM), but also extends the service life of the GDBs and the anode standalone MPL at least 138 times (2 760 000&#160;h assuming 20 000&#160;h of CCM) comparing to CCM. Therefore, the standalone MPL significantly enhances the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells and is promising to be an indispensable component in the next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

         <title>Fabrication of Single&#8208;Crystalline CoCrFeNi Thin Films by DC Magnetron Sputtering: A Route to Surface Studies of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epitaxial growth of the high&#8208;entropy alloy CoCrFeNi on MgO(100) by DC magnetron sputtering is demonstrated. The surface reconstruction and electronic band structure of the CoCrFeNi(100) surface is investigated by low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, demonstrating the potential of epitaxial films for fundamental studies of low&#8208;index HEA surfaces.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with their almost limitless number of possible compositions have raised widespread attention in material science. Next to wear and corrosion resistive coatings, their application as tunable electrocatalysts has recently moved into the focus. On the other hand, fundamental properties of HEA surfaces like atomic and electronic structure, surface segregation and diffusion as well as adsorption on HEA surfaces are barely explored. The lack of research is caused by the limited availability of single&#8208;crystalline samples. In the present work, the epitaxial growth of face centered cubic (fcc) CoCrFeNi films on MgO(100) is reported. Their characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates that the layers with a homogeneous and close to equimolar elemental composition are oriented in [100] direction and aligned with the substrate to which they form an abrupt interface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low&#8208;energy electron diffraction (LEED), and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to study chemical composition and atomic and electronic structure of CoCrFeNi(100). It is demonstrated that epitaxially grown HEA films have the potential to fill the sample gap, allowing for fundamental studies of properties of and processes on well&#8208;defined HEA surfaces over the full compositional&#160;space.

         <title>Flowthrough Capture of Microplastics through Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Interfacial Interactions on Wood Sawdust</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are developed based on wood sawdust support for the removal of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water. Due to the unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions, bioCap is capable of capturing a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics with various types (six types), surface charges (anionic, cationic, and neutral), and shapes (spherical and irregular).








Abstract
Nano&#8208;/microplastics accumulate in aquatic bodies and raise increasing threats to ecosystems and human health. The limitation of existing water cleanup strategies, especially in the context of nano&#8208;/microplastics, primarily arises from their complexity (morphological, compositional, and dimensional). Here, highly efficient and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are reported to remove a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water: polyethylene terephthalate (anionic, irregular shape), polyethylene (net neutral, irregular shape), polystyrene (anionic and cationic, spherical shape), and other anionic and spherical shaped particles (polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride). Highly efficient bioCap systems that adsorb the ubiquitous particles released from beverage bags are demonstrated. As evidence of removal from drinking water, the in vivo biodistribution of nano&#8208;/microplastics is profiled, confirming a significant reduction of particle accumulation in main organs. The unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions is employed in sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and facile strategies based on wood sawdust support for the removal of challenging nano&#8208;/microplastics pollutions.

&lt;p&gt;A sustainable, cost-effective, highly efficient, and bio-based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are developed based on wood sawdust support for the removal of nano-/microplastics from water. Due to the unique advantage of phenolic-mediated multi-molecular interactions, bioCap is capable of capturing a broad spectrum of nano-/microplastics with various types (six types), surface charges (anionic, cationic, and neutral), and shapes (spherical and irregular).

         <title>Printable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;Integrated Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ intermediate phase transition&#8208;controlled blade&#8208;coating method for FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is introduced, which obtains a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.86% based on hole transport layer&#8208;free structures of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Semitransparent devices are fabricated and obtain high PCE of 8.61% at average visible light transmittance (AVT) =&#160;45% and PCE of 5.55% at AVT&#160;=&#160;53% for small devices and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, the study proposes an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimizes the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V is obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrate high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

         <title>Efficient Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with Highly Specific and Durable Targeted Ta2C Modified with Chondroitin Sulfate (TACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
TACS keeps stable in gastrointestinal tract and targets the inflammatory lesions efficiently and accurately. TACS has specific CT imaging for IBD and alleviates the five major pathological features of IBD including alleviating oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, anti&#8208;inflammation, restoring barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiome.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta2C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) is evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS is modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion&#8208;specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptors. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function, and strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non&#8208;invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first&#8208;line drug 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.

         <title>Surface Electronic Structure Engineering of Manganese Bismuth Tellurides Guided by Micro&#8208;Focused Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dramatic modifications of the surface electronic structures of the magnetic topological insulator compounds MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 are directly visualized using micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. A general method to achieve a minimal dispersion with topological bands close to the Fermi energy is demonstrated across the compounds.








Abstract
Modification of the electronic structure of quantum matter by ad atom deposition allows for directed fundamental design of electronic and magnetic properties. This concept is utilized in the present study in order to tune the surface electronic structure of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi2Te4. The topological bands of these systems are typically strongly electron&#8208;doped and hybridized with a manifold of surface states that place the salient topological states out of reach of electron transport and practical applications. In this study, micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) provides direct access to the termination&#8208;dependent dispersion of MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 during in situ deposition of rubidium atoms. The resulting band structure changes are found to be highly complex, encompassing coverage&#8208;dependent ambipolar doping effects, removal of surface state hybridization, and the collapse of a surface state band gap. In addition, doping&#8208;dependent band bending is found to give rise to tunable quantum well states. This wide range of observed electronic structure modifications can provide new ways to exploit the topological states and the rich surface electronic structures of manganese bismuth&#160;tellurides.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Hydrogel Electrolytes Based on Slide&#8208;Ring Pseudo&#8208;Polyrotaxane for Ultralong&#8208;Cycling Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte is developed by confining the anions between two ring&#8208;shaped cyclodextrins to allow Zn2+ transfer along the outside of the rings. It delivers a large Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles in flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries at 5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with high capacity and long cycle stability are essential for wearable electronic devices. Hydrogel electrolytes have been developed to provide ion&#8208;transfer channels while maintaining the integrity of ZIBs under mechanical strain. However, hydrogel matrices are typically swollen with aqueous salt solutions to increase ionic conductivity, which can hinder intimate contact with electrodes and reduce mechanical properties. To address this, a single&#8208;Zn&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) is developed by integrating polyacrylamide network and pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxane structure.

&lt;p&gt;A single-Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-conducting hydrogel electrolyte is developed by confining the anions between two ring-shaped cyclodextrins to allow Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer along the outside of the rings. It delivers a large Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.923 and exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles in flexible zinc-ion batteries at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) with high capacity and long cycle stability are essential for wearable electronic devices. Hydrogel electrolytes have been developed to provide ion-transfer channels while maintaining the integrity of ZIBs under mechanical strain. However, hydrogel matrices are typically swollen with aqueous salt solutions to increase ionic conductivity, which can hinder intimate contact with electrodes and reduce mechanical properties. To address this, a single-Zn-ion-conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) is developed by integrating polyacrylamide network and pseudo-polyrotaxane structure. The SIHE exhibits a high Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.923 and a high ionic conductivity of 22.4 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. Symmetric batteries with SIHE demonstrate stable Zn plating/stripping performance for over 160 h, with a homogenous and smooth Zn deposition layer. Full cells with La-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes exhibit a high capacity of 439 mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the flexible ZIBs display stable electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, such as bending, cutting, puncturing, and soaking. This work provides a simple design strategy for single-ion-conducting hydrogel electrolytes, which could pave the way for long-life aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow&#8208;Bandwidth Deep&#8208;Red Electroluminescence Based on Green Plant&#8208;Derived Carbon Dots</title>

         <dc:description>
Bright deep&#8208;red fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with an ultra&#8208;narrow FWHM of 21 nm and a high quantum yield of 52% are prepared by readily available green plants. High color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these CDs are demonstrated for the first time with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307) by using an exciplex host.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (DR&#8208;LEDs, &gt;660&#160;nm) with high color&#8208;purity and narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission are promising for full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting applications. Currently, the DR&#8208;LEDs are mainly based on conventional emitters such as organic materials and heavy&#8208;metal based quantum dots (QDs) and perovskites. However, the organic materials always suffer from the complicated synthesis, inferior color purity with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) more than&#8201;40&#8201;nm, and the QDs and perovskites still suffer from serious problems related to toxicity. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of efficient and high color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red carbon dots (CDs) with a record narrow FWHM of 21&#160;nm and a high quantum yield of more than 50% from readily available green plants. Moreover, an exciplex host is further established using a polymer and small molecular blend, which has been shown to be an efficient strategy for producing high color&#8208;purity monochrome emission from deep&#8208;red CDs via F&#246;rster energy transfer (FET). The deep&#8208;red CD&#8208;LEDs display high color&#8208;purity with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307). To the best of the knowledge, this is the first report of high color&#8208;purity CD&#8208;LEDs in the deep&#8208;red region, opening the door for the application of CDs in the development of high&#8208;resolution light&#8208;emitting display technologies.

         <title>Ultralow Tip&#8208;Force Driven Sizable&#8208;Area Domain Manipulation through Transverse Flexoelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to activate the transverse flexoelectricity with a widely influenced range through the flexural suspended films. Sizable&#8208;area (2500 times larger than the tip&#8208;surface contact area) domain switching is successfully realized in hundreds of nanometer&#8208;thick (up to 550 nm) van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6, driving by a single&#8208;point ultralow tip&#8208;force with the surface intact.








Abstract
Deterministic control of ferroelectric domain is critical in the ferroelectric functional electronics. Ferroelectric polarization can be manipulated mechanically with a nano&#8208;tip through flexoelectricity. However, it usually occurs in a very localized area in ultrathin films, with possible permanent surface damage caused by a large tip&#8208;force. Here it is demonstrated that the deliberate engineering of transverse flexoelectricity offers a powerful tool for improving the mechanical domain switching. Sizable&#8208;area domain switching under an ultralow tip&#8208;force can be realized in suspended van der Waals ferroelectrics with the surface intact, due to the enhanced transverse flexoelectric field. The film thickness range for domain switching in suspended ferroelectrics is significantly improved by an order of magnitude to hundreds of nanometers, being far beyond the limited range of the substrate&#8208;supported ones. The experimental results and phase&#8208;field simulations further reveal the crucial role of the transverse flexoelectricity in the domain manipulation. This large&#8208;scale mechanical manipulation of ferroelectric domain provides opportunities for the flexoelectricity&#8208;based domain controls in emerging low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and related devices.

         <title>Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles by a Step&#8208;Alloying Strategy as a Superior Multifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to prepare a series of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle (HEA&#8208;NP) systems that contain many strongly immiscible element pairs, including Bi&#8211;W with the highest &#916;Hmix of 45&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. This strategy further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is significant for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) have attracted great attention because of their unique complex compositions and tailorable properties. Further expanding the compositional space is of great significance for enriching the material library. Here, a step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to synthesis HEA&#8208;NPs containing a range of strongly repellent elements (e.g., Bi&#8211;W) by using the rich&#8208;Pt cores formed during the first liquid phase reaction as the seed of the second thermal diffusion. Remarkably, the representative HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) with up to 14 elements exhibits extremely excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Briefly, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) only requires the ultralow overpotentials of 11 and 18&#160;mV to deliver 10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits ultralong durability for 400 and 264&#160;h under 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4 and 1&#160;m KOH, respectively, which surpasses most advanced pH&#8208;universal HER catalysts. Moreover, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) also exhibits an impressive peak current density of 12.6&#8201;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt in 1&#160;m KOH&#160;+&#160;1&#160;m MeOH and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (vs RHE.) in 0.1&#160;m KOH. The work further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is important for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.

The Fe intercalation on the interstitial sites in high Curie temperature (Tc) Fe3GeTe2 may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc.








Abstract
Fe3GeTe2 have proven to be of greatly intrigue. However, the underlying mechanism behind the varying Curie temperature (Tc) values remains a puzzle. This study explores the atomic structure of Fe3GeTe2 crystals exhibiting Tc values of 160, 210, and 230 K. The elemental mapping reveals a Fe&#8208;intercalation on the interstitial sites within the van der Waals gap of the high&#8208;Tc (210 and 230 K) samples, which are observed to have an exchange bias effect by electrical transport measurements, while Fe intercalation or the bias effect is absent in the low&#8208;Tc (160 K) samples. First&#8208;principles calculations further suggest that the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc. This discovery of the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer elucidates the mechanism behind the hidden antiferromagnetic ordering that underlies the enhancement of Tc in Fe3GeTe2.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Knitting Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are additively manufactured from LCE fibers by knitting technology. The obtained knitted LCE actuators with diverse 3D geometry can be rationally designed and perform programmed deformability. The knitted LCE actuators can be fully recycled, and its functionality can be further extended by threading and stitching. This study introduces a new avenue for the fabrication of LCE actuators.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) exhibits large and reversible deformability originating from the alignment of liquid crystal mesogens. Additive manufacturing provides high controllability in the alignment and shaping process of LCE actuators. However, it still remains a challenge to customize LCE actuators with both diverse 3D deformability and recyclability. In this study, a new strategy is developed to exploit knitting technique to additively manufacture LCE actuators. The obtained LCE actuators are fabric&#8208;structured with designed geometry and deformability. By accurately adjusting the parameters of the knitting patterns as modules, diverse geometry is pixel&#8208;wise designed, and complex 3D deformations including bending, twisting, and folding are quantitatively controlled. In addition, the fabric&#8208;structured LCE actuators can be threaded, stitched, and reknitted to achieve advanced geometry, integrated multi&#8208;functions and efficient recyclability. This approach allows the fabrication of versatile LCE actuators with potential applications in smart textiles and soft robots.

         <title>Toughening CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers Through Ionomer Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and properties of CO2&#8208;derived block polymer thermoplastic elastomers and ionomers, with Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III) (&lt;1&#160;wt% metal), are reported. The materials show wide operating temperatures, &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength than unfunctionalized materials, high elastic recovery, and creep&#8208;resistance, and are recyclable.








Abstract
Utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) to make polycarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of CO2 and epoxides valorizes and recycles CO2 and reduces pollution in polymer manufacturing. Recent developments in catalysis provide access to polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and allow for copolymerization with biomass&#8208;derived monomers; however, the resulting material properties are underinvestigated. Here, new types of CO2&#8208;derived thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are described together with a generally applicable method to augment tensile mechanical strength and Young's modulus without requiring material re&#8208;design. These TPEs combine high glass transition temperature (Tg) amorphous blocks comprising CO2&#8208;derived poly(carbonates) (A&#8208;block), with low Tg poly(&#949;&#8208;decalactone), from castor oil, (B&#8208;block) in ABA structures. The poly(carbonate) blocks are selectively functionalized with metal&#8208;carboxylates where the metals are Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III). The colorless polymers, featuring &lt;1&#160;wt% metal, show tunable thermal (Tg), and mechanical (elongation at break, elasticity, creep&#8208;resistance) properties. The best elastomers show &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength, without compromise to elastic recovery, compared with the starting block polymers. They have wide operating temperatures (&#8722;20 to 200&#160;&#176;C), high creep&#8208;resistance and yet remain recyclable. In the future, these materials may substitute high&#8208;volume petrochemical elastomers and be utilized in high&#8208;growth fields like medicine, robotics, and electronics.

         <title>Interfacial Passivation Enormously Enhances Electroluminescence of Triphenylphosphine Cu4I4 Cube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes based on mono&#8208;dentate ligands with high luminance and efficiencies are realized through a non&#8208;doped bilayer structure of [TPP]4Cu4I4|TmPyPB, in which pyridine&#8208;capped TmPyPB effectively passivates surface defects of [TPP]4Cu4I4 layer to prevent interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation, resulting in &#8776;200 and 23 folds increased luminance and external quantum efficiency, respectively.








Abstract
Defect is one of the key factors limiting optoelectronic performances of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid systems. Although high&#8208;efficiency bidentate ligands based electroluminescent (EL) clusters reported, until present, only few EL clusters based on monodentate ligands are realized since their structural instability induces more surface/interface defects. Herein, this bottleneck is first overcome in virtue of interfacial passivation by electron transporting layers (ETL). Through using TmPyPB with meta&#8208;linked pyridines as ETL, photoluminescent (PL) and EL quantum efficiencies of the simplest monophosphine Cu4I4 cube [TPP]4Cu4I4 are greatly improved by &#8776;2 and 23 folds, respectively, as well as &#8776;200 folds increased luminance, corresponding to a huge leap from nearly unlighted (&lt;20 nits) to highly bright (&gt;3000 nits). The passivation effect of TmPyPB on surface defects of cluster layer is embodied as preventing interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation.

         <title>4D Visualization of a Nonthermal Coherent Magnon in a Laser Heated Lattice by an X&#8208;ray Free Electron Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment using an X&#8208;ray free electron laser visualizes a light&#8208;induced coherent magnon in a multiferroic. The magnon trajectory in time and 3D space unveils the photomagnetic coupling largely enhanced by above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, distinguished from a laser&#8208;heated magnetic behavior. This energy&#8208;efficient photoexcitation process suggests the potential for a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.








Abstract
Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic phenomena is an exciting achievement of mankind, expanding one's horizon of knowledge toward the functional nonequilibrium states. The dynamics acting on an extremely short timescale push the detection limits that reveal fascinating light&#8211;matter interactions for nonthermal creation of effective magnetic fields. While some cases are benchmarked by emergent transient behaviors, otherwise identifying the nonthermal effects remains challenging. Here, a femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment is introduced, which uses an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser (XFEL) to distinguish between the effective field and the photoinduced thermal effect.

&lt;p&gt;Femtosecond time-resolved resonant magnetic X-ray diffraction experiment using an X-ray free electron laser visualizes a light-induced coherent magnon in a multiferroic. The magnon trajectory in time and 3D space unveils the photomagnetic coupling largely enhanced by above-bandgap photoexcitation, distinguished from a laser-heated magnetic behavior. This energy-efficient photoexcitation process suggests the potential for a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic phenomena is an exciting achievement of mankind, expanding one's horizon of knowledge toward the functional nonequilibrium states. The dynamics acting on an extremely short timescale push the detection limits that reveal fascinating light&#8211;matter interactions for nonthermal creation of effective magnetic fields. While some cases are benchmarked by emergent transient behaviors, otherwise identifying the nonthermal effects remains challenging. Here, a femtosecond time-resolved resonant magnetic X-ray diffraction experiment is introduced, which uses an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) to distinguish between the effective field and the photoinduced thermal effect. It is observed that a multiferroic Y-type hexaferrite exhibits magnetic Bragg peak intensity oscillations manifesting entangled antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Fourier components of a coherent AFM magnon. The magnon trajectory constructed in 3D space and time domains is decisive to evince ultrafast field formation preceding the lattice thermalization. A remarkable impact of photoexcitation across the electronic bandgap is directly unraveled, amplifying the photomagnetic coupling that is one of the highest among AFM dielectrics. Leveraging the above-bandgap photoexcitation, this energy-efficient optical process further suggests a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Sub&#8208;5 Nanometer bis(Diarylcarbene)&#8208;Based Thin Film for Molecular Electronics and Plasmonics</title>

Robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier are accessible, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond and shows promising applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.








Abstract
In miniaturized electronic and optoelectronic circuits, molecular tunnel junctions have attracted enormous research interest due to their small footprint, low power consumption, and rich molecular functions. However, the most popular building blocks used in contemporary molecular tunnel junctions are thiol molecules, which attach to electrode surfaces via a metal&#8208;thiolate (M&#63743;S) bond, showing low stability and usually quick degradation within several days. To pave the way for more widely applicable and stable molecular tunnel junctions, there is a need to develop new molecular anchoring groups. Here, this work&#160;demonstrates robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond. The bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions exhibit high thermal stability against heating up to 200 &#176;C and long storage lifetime over 5 months in an ambient environment. Both electrical and optical performance of these bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular junctions are&#160;characterized systematically, showing similar behaviors to thiol&#8208;based junctions as well as largely improved emission stability. This research highlights the excellent performance of bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions, which could&#160;be useful for applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.

         <title>Crystallinity and Phase Control in Formamidinium&#8208;Based Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D Perovskite via Seed&#8208;Induced Growth for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>

This study presents a seed&#8208;induced growth approach employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phaseand mitigating random phases. As a result, the optimized device delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%.








Abstract
2D perovskites based on Formamidinium (FA) hold the potential for excellent stability and a broad absorption range, making them attractive materials for solar cells. However, FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites produced via one&#8208;step processing exhibit poor crystallinity and random quasi&#8208;quantum wells (QWs), leading to subpar photovoltaic performance. In this study, a seed&#8208;induced growth approach is introduced employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds preferentially precipitate and serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phase. Moreover, the epitaxial growth facilitated by uniformly dispersed seeds results in simultaneous crystallization from top to bottom, efficiently mitigating random phases (n = 2, 3, 4&#8230;) induced by the diffusion of organic cations and, in turn, minimizing energy loss. The impact of seed&#8208;induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites is systematically investigated. As a result, the optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 h of storage.

         <title>Planar Spin Glass with Topologically&#160;Protected Mazes in the Liquid Crystal Targeting for Reconfigurable Micro Security Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deterministic and non&#8208;deterministic properties of a topologically&#160;protected maze in the&#160;chiral liquid crystal (LC) resulting from microscopic order and macroscopic disorder accomplish a security system that serves as advanced artificial fingerprints. This system enables facile authentication through deep&#8208;learning technology and can reconstruct information through the phase transition of LCs.








Abstract
The planar spin glass pattern is widely known for its inherent randomness, resulting from the geometrical frustration. As such, developing physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;which operate with device randomness&#8212;with planar spin glass patterns is a promising candidate for an advanced security systems in the upcoming digitalized society. Despite their inherent randomness, traditional magnetic spin glass patterns pose considerable obstacles in detection, making it challenging to achieve authentication in security systems. This necessitates the development of facilely observable mimetic patterns with similar randomness to overcome these challenges. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced using a topologically&#160;protected maze pattern in the chiral liquid crystals (LCs). This maze exhibits a comparable level of randomness to magnetic spin glass and can be reliably identified through the combination of optical microscopy with machine learning&#8208;based object detection techniques. The &#8220;information&#8221; embedded in the maze can be reconstructed through thermal phase transitions of the LCs in tens of seconds. Furthermore, incorporating various elements can enhance the optical PUF, resulting in a multi&#8208;factor security medium. It is expected that this security medium, based on microscopically controlled and macroscopically uncontrolled topologically&#160;protected structures, may be utilized as a next&#8208;generation security system.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Vaccine that Induces Synergistic Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autologous extracellular nanovesicle vaccine derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells directly activates both innate immune cells and AML&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells without having to define tumor antigens. It induces strong antitumor immune memory and synergizes with chemotherapy to prevent relapse in hosts with AML. Thus, it can be developed as a platform for personalized vaccines in humans.








Abstract
To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient&#8208;specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, extracellular nanovesicles derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC) are presented as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient&#8208;specific neoantigens. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination directly engages with and activates both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;leukemic immune memory. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC sufficiently serves as an antigen&#8208;presenting platform that can directly activate antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multifaceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination results in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia&#8208;free survivors among cytarabine&#8208;treated hosts with AML. Human AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs activate iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML&#8208;specific long&#8208;term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.

It induces strong antitumor immune memory and synergizes with chemotherapy to prevent relapse in hosts with AML. Thus, it can be developed as a platform for personalized vaccines in humans.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient-specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, extracellular nanovesicles derived from alpha-galactosylceramide-conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GC) are presented as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient-specific neoantigens. ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GC vaccination directly engages with and activates both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long-term anti-leukemic immune memory. ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GC sufficiently serves as an antigen-presenting platform that can directly activate antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multifaceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GC vaccination results in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia-free survivors among cytarabine-treated hosts with AML. Human AML-derived ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GCs activate iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML-derived ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML-specific long-term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photopatternable Conjugated Polymer with Thermal&#8208;Annealing&#8208;Promoted Interchain Stacking for Highly Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are designed using a photopatternable conjugated polymer with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking. To prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the polymer is irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, and thermally annealed under a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Photoresponsive polymers can be conveniently used to fabricate anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials through photopatterning. However, an unsolved problem is that ambient light and heat can damage anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns on photoresponsive polymers. Herein, photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are developed by photopatterning and thermal annealing of a photoresponsive conjugated polymer (MC&#8208;Azo). MC&#8208;Azo contains alternating azobenzene and fluorene units in the polymer backbone. To prepare an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material, an MC&#8208;Azo film is irradiated with polarized blue light through a photomask, and then thermally annealed under the pressure of a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C. A key for the stability is that thermal annealing promotes interchain stacking, which converts photoresponsive MC&#8208;Azo to a photostable material. Another key for the stability is that the conjugated structure endows MC&#8208;Azo with desirable thermal properties. This study shows that the design of photopatternable conjugated polymers with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking provides a new strategy for the development of highly stable and secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Bandgap Engineering in Nanoribbons of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective bandgap modulation of water&#8208;adsorbed zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) is reported. A water layer adsorbed at the edges creates a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces its bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs with adsorbates of water can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature.








Abstract
Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It is predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator&#8211;metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, it is&#160;theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that water adsorption greatly reduces the bandgap of zigzag&#8208;oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water molecules can be favorably assembled within the trench between two adjacent BNNRs to form a polar ice layer, which induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V&#160;nm&#8722;1 accounting for the bandgap reduction. Field&#8208;effect transistors are&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of water&#8208;adsorbed zBNNRs can&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via modulation of the equivalent electrical field at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements are&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgaps of zBNNRs with water adsorption. The zBNNR with increased width can exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV. This study offers fundamental insights into new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Derived Bismuth with I&#8722; and Cs+ Dual Modification for High&#8208;Efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electrosynthesis and Al&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>

Hexagonal Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanocrystals are prepared via a hot&#8208;injection method, and under cathodic potentials, are converted to Bi nanocrystals with the dual modification of I&#8722; and Cs+ on surface. The resultant catalyst exhibits great performances for CO2 reduction reaction to formate in both the H&#8208;cell and flow cell, and when used as the cathode catalyst for Al&#8208;CO2 batteries, enable simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.








Abstract
Bi&#8208;based materials are one of the most promising candidates for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate; however, the majority of them still suffer from low current density and stability that essentially constrain their potential applications at the industrial scale. Surface modification represents an effective approach to modulate the electrode microenvironment and the relative binding strength of key intermediates. Herein, it is&#160;demonstrated that the surface comodification with halides and alkali metal ions from the conversion of Bi&#8208;based halide perovskite nanocrystals is a viable strategy to boost the CO2RR performance of Bi for formate electrosynthesis. Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are prepared by a hot&#8208;injection method. The as&#8208;prepared products feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal shape and uniform size distribution. When used as the precatalyst, Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are converted to Cs+ and I&#8722; comodified Bi. The resultant catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency close to 100%, and remarkable partial current density up to 44&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an H&#8208;cell and up to 276&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Moreover, Cs3Bi2I9 is used as the cathode catalyst and paired with an Al anode in an Al&#8208;CO2 battery for simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Phase&#8208;Transition Entropy into Electrochemical Thermopower and the Peltier Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is applied to the electrolyte of thermocell and electrochemical Peltier effect. By undergoing a coil&#8211;globule phase transition, the polymer exhibits a significant entropy change, resulting in a drastic increase in the Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the thermocell.








Abstract
A thermocell generates thermopower from a temperature difference (&#916;T) between two electrodes. The converse process of thermocells is an electrochemical Peltier effect, which creates a &#916;T on the electrodes by applying an external current. The Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the electrochemical system is proportional to the entropy change of the redox reaction; therefore, a redox system having a significant entropy change is expected to increase the Se. In this study, a thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is used as the redox species of a thermocell. PNV2+ dication undergoes the coil&#8211;globule phase transition upon the reduction to PNV+ cation radical, and a large entropy change is introduced because water molecules are freed from the polymer chains. The Se of PNV thermocell drastically increased to +2.1&#160;mV K&#8722;1 at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNV. The entropy change calculated from the increment of Se agrees with the value evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the electrochemical Peltier effect is observed when the device temperature is increased above the LCST. This study shows that the large entropy change associated with the coil&#8211;globule phase transition can be used in electrochemical thermal management and refrigeration technologies.

&lt;p&gt;A thermoresponsive polymer having a redox-active moiety, poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-isopropyl acrylamide-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-acrylamide ethyl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-propylviologen) (PNV), is applied to the electrolyte of thermocell and electrochemical Peltier effect.

&lt;p&gt;A thermocell generates thermopower from a temperature difference (&#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) between two electrodes. The converse process of thermocells is an electrochemical Peltier effect, which creates a &#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; on the electrodes by applying an external current. The Seebeck coefficient (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;

In this study, a thermoresponsive polymer having a redox-active moiety, poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-isopropyl acrylamide-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;(2-acrylamide ethyl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-propylviologen) (PNV), is used as the redox species of a thermocell.

         <title>Biofilm Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly Nanoreactors for All&#8208;Stage Biofilm Associated Infection through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;like Death and Macrophage Re&#8208;Rousing</title>

Biofilm microenvironment responsive self&#8208;assembly copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate nanoreactors are proposed for all&#8208;stage biofilm&#8208;associated infections through bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death and macrophage re&#8208;rousing.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilm&#8208;associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H2O2&#8208;rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, a BME&#8208;responsive copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu&#8208;POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re&#8208;rousing for BAI eradication at all stages is proposed. The self&#8208;assembly of Cu&#8208;POM in BME converts endogenous H2O2 to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generates a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu&#8208;POM flux. Metabolomics reveals that intracellular Cu&#8208;POM overload restricts the TCA cycle and peroxide accumulation, promoting bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. CDT re&#8208;rousing macrophages scavenge planktonic bacteria escaping biofilm disintegration through enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Overall, BME&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;POM promotes bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death via metabolic interference, while also re&#8208;rousing macrophage immune response for further planktonic bacteria elimination, resulting in all&#8208;stage BAI clearance and providing a new reference for future clinical application.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Negative Resistance Switching of Conductive Fibers with Adjustable Sensitivity for Wearable Healthcare Monitoring Systems with Near&#8208;Zero Standby Power</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) fiber strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative gauge factor that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. This NRS fiber strain&#8208;sensor can be used to implement an ultralow&#8208;power healthcare monitoring system that transmits biological signals by only operating with an abnormally functioning body or when strain is applied.








Abstract
Recently, one of the primary concerns in e&#8208;textile&#8208;based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, as the system should be always&#8208;on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge&#8208;factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive&#8208;fiber&#8208;based negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio &#8776; 3.9&#160;&#215; 108) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet&#8208;irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain&#8208;sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E&#8208;fitness pants, smart&#8208;masks, and posture correction T&#8208;shirts) with near&#8208;zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain&#8208;sensors.

         <title>A Programmable Actuator as Synthetic Earthworm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;responsive actuator with notable deformation, rapid response, and heavy workload is prepared via a swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. Its bending deformation under humidity change can be programmed to mimic the burrowing activities of earthworms, opening a new avenue to expand stimuli&#8208;responsive and degradable polymer materials in the areas associated with agricultural considerations.








Abstract
Natural earthworm with the ability to loosen soils that favors sustainable agriculture has inspired worldwide interest in the design of intelligent actuators. Given the inability to carry heavy loads and uncontrolled deformation, the vast majority of actuators can only perform simple tasks by bending, contraction, or elongation. Herein, a degradable actuator with the ability to deform in desired ways is presented, which successfully mimics the burrowing activities of earthworms to loosen soils with increased soil porosity by digging, grabbing, and lifting the soil when it receives rains. Such a scarifying actuator is made of degradable cellulose acetate and uncrosslinked polyacrylamide via the swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. The water absorption of polyacrylamide in moisture conditions causes rapid and remarkable bending. Such mechanical bending can be controlled in specific areas of the cellulose acetate film if polyacrylamide is polymerized in a patterned way, so as to generate complicated deformations of the whole cellulose acetate. Patterning polyacrylamide within cellulose acetate is achieved based on reversible surface protection by means of pen writing, rather than the traditional masking techniques. The water&#8208;induced deformation of programmable cellulose&#8208;based actuators is well preserved in soil, which is appropriate for promoting rain diffusion as well as root breath.

         <title>Photocontrollable Elongation Actuation of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Films with Well&#8208;Defined Crease Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocontrollable elongation actuation with large strain can be achieved in flexible polydomain liquid crystal elastomers by programing the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the weak actuation forces generated in the creases.








Abstract
Although liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have demonstrated various applications in artificial muscles and soft robotics, their inherent flexibility and orientation&#8208;dependent forces limit their functions. For instance, LCEs can sustain a high actuation force when they contract but cannot elongate to drive loads with large displacements. In this study, it is demonstrated that photocontrollable elongation actuation with a large strain can be achieved in polydomain LCEs by programming the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the actuation forces. Efficient photoactuation without overheating&#8208;induced damage to the materials is favored, based on the well&#8208;designed photosensitive molecular switch crosslinker via the synergy of photochemical and photothermal effects. The LCE actuator can jack up heavy loads, elongate freely, and contract back to manipulate distant objects. Theoretical analysis based on a finite element simulation of the deformation energy during the actuation process reveals a trade&#8208;off between the abilities of jacking&#8208;up and withstanding load. More importantly, this study simplifies the design of a single material with functions inherent only in other soft robotic devices based on the assembly of multiple&#160;modules, thus providing a design strategy for surpassing instinctive properties of conventional soft materials to expand the functions of soft robotics.

For instance, LCEs can sustain a high actuation force when they contract but cannot elongate to drive loads with large displacements. In this study, it is demonstrated that photocontrollable elongation actuation with a large strain can be achieved in polydomain LCEs by programming the crease structures in a well-defined order to couple the actuation forces. Efficient photoactuation without overheating-induced damage to the materials is favored, based on the well-designed photosensitive molecular switch crosslinker via the synergy of photochemical and photothermal effects. The LCE actuator can jack up heavy loads, elongate freely, and contract back to manipulate distant objects. Theoretical analysis based on a finite element simulation of the deformation energy during the actuation process reveals a trade-off between the abilities of jacking-up and withstanding load. More importantly, this study simplifies the design of a single material with functions inherent only in other soft robotic devices based on the assembly of multiple&#160;modules, thus providing a design strategy for surpassing instinctive properties of conventional soft materials to expand the functions of soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shaping Synthetic Multicellular and Complex Multimaterial Tissues via Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing of Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of extrusion&#8208;based and volumetric bioprinting, with microgels as platform materials, provides the possibility to create complex structures on a cm3&#8208;scale in a fast and accurate manner. By leveraging the versatility of this platform, it is possible to introduce multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular features in user defined&#8208;architectures.








Abstract
In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro&#8208; and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically&#8208;relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion&#8208;bioprinting and layer&#8208;less, ultra&#8208;fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light&#8208;responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (&#181;Resins) for light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self&#8208;organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin&#8208;based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. &#181;Resins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimeter&#8208;scale, granular hydrogel&#8208;based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EmVP is applied to create complex synthetic biology&#8208;inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic&#8208;engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with biological functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.

         <title>Enabling Highly Efficient and Thermal&#8208;Stable Polymer Solar Cells through Semi&#8208;Alloy Acceptors Composed of a Hinge&#8208;Like Dimer: A Versatile Doping Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hinge&#8208;like dimer acceptor DT19 is designed and synthesized as a special third component. This dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality in synergistically improving device efficiency and thermal stability of relevant host systems.








Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability is a critical scientific challenge in advancing the commercial applications of polymer solar cells. To address this challenge, a dumbbell&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptor, DT19, is successfully designed and synthesized. It is incorporated as a third component into the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This ternary strategy demonstrates a synergistic enhancement of the PCE and thermal stability of the host binary system. In particular, the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9:DT19 system maintains a PCE of over 90% even after heating at 120&#160;&#176;C for 200&#160;h. Additionally, the dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality for the other four Y&#8208;series systems and outperforms ternary systems containing alloy&#8208;like acceptors in terms of thermal stability. It is because DT19, with its hinge&#8208;like structure, can form a semi&#8208;alloy acceptor with the host acceptor, leading to strong interchain entanglement with the polymer donor, thus overcoming phase separation and excessive aggregation under thermal stress. This new type of dimeric material, which can synergistically enhance the device efficiency and thermal stability of active layers, presents promising application prospects.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics on Perovskite Oxides via Oxygen Vacancies for Low&#8208;Temperature and Knittable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of a perovskite oxide is significantly promoted by a facile metal&#8211;vacancy strategy. The newly developed vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite nanofibers exhibit comparable activities to the commercial Pt/C and even surpass it under low temperature. The developed catalyst can drive knittable fibrous&#8208;type and sandwich&#8208;type zinc&#8211;air batteries under low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with impressive performance.








Abstract
High kinetics oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts under low temperature are critical and highly desired for temperature&#8208;tolerant energy conversion and storage devices, but remain insufficiently investigated. Herein, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite oxide (CaMnO3) nanofibers coated with reduced graphene oxide coating (V&#8208;CMO/rGO) are developed as the air electrode catalyst for low&#8208;temperature and knittable Zn&#8211;air batteries. V&#8208;CMO/rGO exhibits top&#8208;level ORR activity among perovskite oxides and shows impressive kinetics under low temperature. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the synergistic effect between metal atoms and oxygen vacancies, as well as the accelerated kinetics and enhanced electric conductivity and mass transfer over the rGO coated nanofiber 3D network contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The desorption of ORR intermediate is promoted by the regulated electron filling. The V&#8208;CMO/rGO drives knittable and flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries under a low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with high peak power density of 56 mW cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of over 80 h. This study provides insight of kinetically active catalyst and facilitates the ZABs application in harsh environment.

         <title>Modulating Zinc Metal Reversibility by Confined Antifluctuator Film for Durable and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the designed Zn anode antifluctuator that well integrates conductivity, buffering, mechanical strength, and anti&#8208;corrosion characteristics, the symmetric and full cell both deliver super&#8208;high cycling performance and enable the realization of the integration with electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device as artificial neural networks, and the integrated device achieves excellent linearity and handwritten digit recognition rate.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries are promising systems due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and non&#8208;toxicity, and the Zn corrosion and dendrite growth will cause the poor reversibility of Zn anode. Herein, the porous Zn@C solid, hollow, and yolk&#8211;shell microsphere films are developed as Zn anode antifluctuator (ZAAF). The prepared yolk&#8211;shell microspheres (Zn@C yolk&#8211;shell microsphere [ZCYSM]) film with superior buffering can effectively restrict the deposition of Zn metal in its interior and inhibit the volume expansion during plating/stripping process, thus modulating the Zn2+ flux and enabling stable Zn cycling. As a proof of concept, the ZCYSM@Zn symmetric cells achieve the excellent cyclic stability over 4000&#160;h and cumulative plated capacity of 4&#160;Ah cm&#8722;2&#160;at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Concomitantly, the suppressed corrosion reactions and dendrite&#8208;free ZAAF significantly improve the durability of full cells (coupled to CaV6O16&#183;3H2O). Additionally, durable pouch cell and electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device (ENIDe) are integrated to simulate neural network, providing a strategy for extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain.

         <dc:description>
To investigate the bifunctional performance of hetero&#8208;anionic structure for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts are constructed and afford excellent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The superior performance of the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#63743;S bond provides fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The electronic structure of transition metal complexes can be modulated by replacing partial ion of complexes to obtain tuned intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. However, the anion&#8208;modulated transition metal complexes ORR activity of is still unsatisfactory, and the construction of hetero&#8208;anionic structure remains challenging. Herein, an atomic doping strategy is presented to prepare the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 (CCSO/NC&#8208;2) as electrocatalysts, the structrual characterization results favorably demonstrate the partial substitution of S atoms for O in CCSO/NC&#8208;2, which shows excellent catalytic performance and durability for OER and ORR in 0.1&#160;m KOH. In addition, the catalyst assembled Zinc&#8211;air battery with an open circuit potential of 1.43&#160;V maintains performance after 300&#160;h of cyclic stability. Theoretical calculations and differential charges illustrate that S doping optimizes the reaction kinetics and promotes electron redistribution. The superior performance of CCSO/NC&#8208;2 catalysis is mainly due to its unique S modulation of the electronic structure of the main body. The introduction of S promotes Co&#63743;O covalency and constructs a fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.

Bandgap Modulation
In article number 2303198, Weida Hu, Zhuhua Zhang, Haomin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report effective bandgap modulation in zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) via water adsorption. The water layer adsorbed along the edges is believed to create a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces the bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via gating at room temperature.

Multifunctional Mechanical Metamaterials
The accordion can deliver a diverse range of melodies contingent upon the sequence of keys and bellows movement activated by the performer. In article number 2301109, Lei Wu and Damiano Pasini introduce a multifunctional mechanical metamaterial whose building block resembles the individual keys and bellows of an accordion. By activating the high&#8208;energy stable state of selected building blocks, the metamaterial can exhibit reprogrammable mechanical instabilities that can be engaged for accomplishing logical operations and tunable mechanical hysteresis in multifunctional devices.

Oxygen Electrocatalysis
To investigate the bifunctional performance of heterogeneous anionic structures for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8722;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), are designed by Ting Ouyang, Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2303488. The superior catalytic performance of CuCo2O4&#8722;xSx/NC&#8208;2 is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#8211;S bonds&#8208;constructed fast electron&#8208;transport channels, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active&#8208;site Co to the reaction intermediates.

Strain Sensors
In article number 2303556, Taeyoon Lee, Hyun Jae Kim, and co&#8208;workers introduce a breakthrough negative&#8208;responsive switch&#8208;type fiber strain&#8208;sensor, which exhibits a dramatic conductivity shift from insulating to conducting properties. This sensor, pivotal for ultralow&#8208;power healthcare monitoring, activates uniquely with abnormal body functions or applied strain. The &#8220;E&#8208;fitness pants&#8221; here are a wearable system for monitoring exercise while also counting repetitions, thus encapsulating a holistic approach to fitness and health tracking.

Topologically Protected Structures
In article number 2303077, S. Joon Kwon, Dong Ki Yoon, and co&#8208;workers present a cutting&#8208;edge security system based on liquid crystal structures. These structures exhibit highly unpredictable pathways akin to the randomness observed in planar spin glasses. The cover image suggests that the randomness of cholesteric fingers and the erratic movements of people running freely in a maze are inherently unpredictable.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The basic concepts and components of liquid crystals and the functional materials derived from them are introduced. After that, their ongoing and foreseeable biomedical applications are discussed. 








Abstract
Liquid crystal is a state of matter being intermediate between solid and liquid. Liquid crystal materials exhibit both orientational order and fluidity. While liquid crystals have long been highly recognized in the display industry, in recent decades, liquid crystals provide new opportunities into the cross&#8208;field of material science and biomedicine due to their biocompatibility, multifunctionality, and responsiveness. In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The start is made by introducing the basic concepts of liquid crystals, and then shifting to the components of liquid crystals as well as functional materials derived therefrom. After that, the ongoing and foreseeable applications of liquid crystal materials in the biomedical field with emphasis put on several cutting&#8208;edge aspects, including drug delivery, bioimaging, tissue engineering, implantable devices, biosensing, and wearable devices are discussed. It is hoped that this review will stimulate ingenious ideas for the future generation of liquid crystal&#8208;based drug development, artificial implants, disease diagnosis, health status monitoring, and beyond.

         <title>Enabling Future Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Direct Cathode Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cathode regeneration methods are summarized to highlight the technical challenges, current status, supply chain, carbon footprints, and possible solutions for closed&#8208;loop battery recycling. The environmental, economic, and political benefits of the direct cathode regeneration methods are also considered, and a reference recycling route with available automated recycling technology is proposed and minimizes the costs.








Abstract
The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles equipped with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) presents serious waste management challenges and environmental hazards for recyclers after scrap. Closed&#8208;loop recycling contributes to the sustainable development of batteries and plays an important role in mitigating raw material shortages and supply chain risks. Herein, current direct cathode regeneration methods for industrialized recycling are outlined and evaluated. Different regeneration methods for spent cathode materials are summarized, which provide a new perspective for realizing closed&#8208;loop recycling of LIBs. A reference recycling route for retrofitting existing cathode production lines is proposed and minimizes the costs. In addition to promoting the industrialization of direct cathode recycling, the environmental, economic, and political benefits of battery recycling are also highlighted.

         <title>Does Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Subdue Issues of Zn Batteries?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to wide electrochemical stability window, water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISEs) are attracting considerable interest. WISEs display distinctive physical and electrochemical properties compared to conventional electrolyte that makes them a promising electrolyte to be used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZnBs). This review provides overview about issues in ZnBs, a historical, basic, thermodynamic, and kinetic overview about WISEs and finally discusses their use in ZnBs.









Abstract
Zn&#8208;metal batteries (ZnBs) are safe and sustainable because of their operability in aqueous electrolytes, abundance of Zn, and recyclability. However, the thermodynamic instability of Zn metal in aqueous electrolytes is a major bottleneck for its commercialization. As such, Zn deposition (Zn2+ &#8594; Zn(s)) is continuously accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ &#8594; H2) and dendritic growth that further accentuate the HER. Consequently, the local pH around the Zn electrode increases and promotes the formation of inactive and/or poorly conductive Zn passivation species (Zn + 2H2O &#8594; Zn(OH)2 + H2) on the Zn. This aggravates the consumption of Zn and electrolyte and degrades the performance of ZnB. To propel HER beyond its thermodynamic potential (0&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 0), the concept of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8208;electrolyte (WISE) has been employed in ZnBs. Since the publication of the first article on WISE for ZnB in 2016, this research area has progressed continuously. Here, an overview and discussion on this promising research direction for accelerating the maturity of ZnBs is provided. The review briefly describes the current issues with conventional aqueous electrolyte in ZnBs, including a historic overview and basic understanding of WISE. Furthermore, the application scenarios of WISE in ZnBs are detailed, with the description of various key mechanisms (e.g., side reactions, Zn electrodeposition, anions or cations intercalation in metal oxide or graphite, and ion transport at low temperature).

     alt="Does Water-in-Salt Electrolyte Subdue Issues of Zn Batteries?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to wide electrochemical stability window, water-in-salt electrolytes (WISEs) are attracting considerable interest. WISEs display distinctive physical and electrochemical properties compared to conventional electrolyte that makes them a promising electrolyte to be used in Zn-ion batteries (ZnBs). This review provides overview about issues in ZnBs, a historical, basic, thermodynamic, and kinetic overview about WISEs and finally discusses their use in ZnBs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zn-metal batteries (ZnBs) are safe and sustainable because of their operability in aqueous electrolytes, abundance of Zn, and recyclability. However, the thermodynamic instability of Zn metal in aqueous electrolytes is a major bottleneck for its commercialization. As such, Zn deposition (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &#8594; Zn(s)) is continuously accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &#8594; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and dendritic growth that further accentuate the HER. Consequently, the local pH around the Zn electrode increases and promotes the formation of inactive and/or poorly conductive Zn passivation species (Zn + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &#8594; Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on the Zn. This aggravates the consumption of Zn and electrolyte and degrades the performance of ZnB. To propel HER beyond its thermodynamic potential (0&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 0), the concept of water-in-salt-electrolyte (WISE) has been employed in ZnBs. Since the publication of the first article on WISE for ZnB in 2016, this research area has progressed continuously. Here, an overview and discussion on this promising research direction for accelerating the maturity of ZnBs is provided. The review briefly describes the current issues with conventional aqueous electrolyte in ZnBs, including a historic overview and basic understanding of WISE. Furthermore, the application scenarios of WISE in ZnBs are detailed, with the description of various key mechanisms (e.g., side reactions, Zn electrodeposition, anions or cations intercalation in metal oxide or graphite, and ion transport at low temperature).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Recovering critical resources from surface water, groundwater, and wastewater sources can offer a sustainable path toward securing their supply chains. This work reviews the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery.








Abstract
Population growth, urbanization, and decarbonization efforts are collectively straining the supply of limited resources that are necessary to produce batteries, electronics, chemicals, fertilizers, and other important products. Securing the supply chains of these critical resources via the development of separation technologies for their recovery represents a major global challenge to ensure stability and security. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater are emerging as potential new sources to bolster these supply chains. Recently, a variety of material&#8208;based technologies have been developed and employed for separations and resource recovery in water. Judicious selection and design of these materials to tune their properties for targeting specific solutes is central to realizing the potential of water as a source for critical resources. Here, the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery are reviewed. In addition, a critical perspective is offered on the grand challenges and key research directions that need to be addressed to improve their practical viability.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Anchored Curved Carbon Surface for Efficient CO2 Electro&#8208;Reduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity and Industrially&#8208;Relevant Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni&#8208;N4 sites on curved carbon surfaces possess a lower energy barrier for *COOH formation, which benefits the CO2 reduction reaction. Accordingly, porous carbon with atomic Ni&#8208;N4 sites and a rich curved surface is developed and exhibits nearly 100 % selectivity for CO formation under a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although single metal atoms on porous carbons (PCs) are widely used in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, these systems have long relied on flat graphene&#8208;based models, which are far beyond reality because of abundant curved structures in PCs; the effect of curved surfaces has long been ignored. In addition, the selectivity generally decreases under high current density, which severely limits practical application. Herein, theoretical calculations reveal that a single&#8208;Ni&#8208;atom on a curved surface can simultaneously enhance the total density of states around Fermi level and decrease the energy barrier for *COOH formation, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. This work reports a rational molten salt approach for preparing PCs with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area of up to 2635 m2 g&#8722;1. As determined by cutting&#8208;edge techniques, a single Ni atom on a curved carbon surface is obtained and used as a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The CO selectivity reaches up to 99.8% under industrial&#8208;level current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PC&#8208;based catalysts. This work not only offers a new method for the rational synthesis of single atom catalysts with strained geometry to host rich active sites, but also provides in&#8208;depth insights for the origin of catalytic activity of curved structure&#8208;enriched PC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Photostable Cascade&#8208;Activatable Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly on a Cancer Cell Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Identification of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system can construct a polypeptide&#8208;based nanofiber structure in situ on a cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term stable imaging of bladder cancer. The targeted peptide can specifically react with the reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) to form TRAP, which exhibits enhanced hydrophobicity simultaneously aggregating into nanofibers. The nanofibers can achieve accurate tumor recognition and enable high&#8208;performance stable imaging, retaining the high signal/noise ratio.








Abstract
Missed or residual tumor burden results in high risk for bladder cancer relapse. However, existing fluorescent probes cannot meet the clinical needs because of inevitable photobleaching properties. Performance can be improved by maintaining intensive and sustained fluorescence signals via resistance to intraoperative saline flushing and intrinsic fluorescent decay, providing surgeons with sufficiently clear and high&#8208;contrast surgical fields, avoiding residual tumors or missed diagnosis. This study designs and synthesizes a photostable cascade&#8208;activatable peptide, a target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system, which can construct polypeptide&#8208;based nanofibers in situ on the cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term and stable imaging of bladder cancer. The probe has two parts: a target peptide (TP) targets CD44v6 to recognize bladder cancer cells, and a reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) is introduced, which effectively reacts with the TP via a click reaction to enhance the hydrophobicity of the whole molecule, assembling into nanofibers and further nanonetworks. Accordingly, probe retention on the cell membrane is prolonged, and photostability is significantly improved. Finally, the TRAP system is successfully employed in the high&#8208;performance identification of human bladder cancer in ex vivo bladder tumor tissues. This cascade&#8208;activatable peptide molecular probe based on the TRAP system enables efficient and stable imaging of bladder cancer.

         <title>A Computationally Assisted Approach for Designing Wearable Biosensors toward Non&#8208;Invasive Personalized Molecular Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated computational framework named QuantumDock is developed for universal molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) development toward a variety of wearable biosensing applications. QuantumDock employs molecular docking and density functional theory to probe the molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules, optimizing the selectivity of the MIP biosensor for the wearable analysis of a wide range of biomarkers. (e.g., phenylalanine).








Abstract
Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine as they can non&#8208;invasively collect molecular information closely associated with an individual's health status. However, the majority of clinically relevant biomarkers cannot be continuously detected in situ using existing wearable approaches. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here, QuantumDock is introduced, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/cross&#8208;linker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, experimental validation of QuantumDock is performed successfully using solution&#8208;synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, a QuantumDock&#8208;optimized graphene&#8208;based wearable device is designed that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. For the first time, wearable non&#8208;invasive phenylalanine monitoring is demonstrated in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping in Ordered and Disordered Domains of Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel organic bioelectronic technologies rely on the efficient electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers. In this work, it is investigated how the doping process can be controlled by the co&#8208;existence of ordered and disordered domains in polymeric films. It is shown that both domains are doped trough different mechanisms and extents, and that optimal conductivity can be achieved by modulating film order.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in electrochemical applications for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and energy harvesting. The design of efficient electrochemical devices relies on large modulations of the polymer conductivity, fast doping/dedoping kinetics, and high ionic uptake. In this work, structure&#8211;property relations are established and control of these parameters by the co&#8208;existence of order and disorder in the phase morphology is demonstrated. Using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman, and terahertz (THz) conductivity measurements, the electrochemical doping in the different morphological domains of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is investigated. The main finding is that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favored. On the other hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct regions. A significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity is evident when bipolarons start forming in the disordered regions, while the presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. This study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced increase in conductivity.

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation within the hydrogel.








Abstract
Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator is developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles that self&#8208;assembles to form a and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils, the mechanical properties are reinforced by covalent intra&#8208; and interfiber cross&#8208;links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstand up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, can be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and can be toughened via&#160;covalent cross&#8208;linking. These materials enable the bioprinting of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids and subsequent differentiation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, these findings highlight the power of covalent reinforcement&#160;of supramolecular fibers, offering a strategy for the bottom&#8208;up design of dynamic, yet tough, hydrogels and bioinks.

         <title>Tumor Eradication by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with 10B&#8208;enriched Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Grafted with Poly(Glycerol)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm 10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG) are developed as a boron nanocarrier for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Benefiting from the small particle size and high stealth efficiency, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles efficiently accumulate in CT26 tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1, resulting in significant tumor shrinkage by BNCT alone.








Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are 10B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. Herein, the design and preparation of sub&#8208;10 nm&#160;10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT are reported. By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 12&#160;h post&#8208;injection. Moreover, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells. BNCT comprising a single bolus injection of h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles and subsequent one&#8208;time neutron irradiation results in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous CT26 tumors. h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG&#8208;mediated BNCT not only causes direct DNA damage to the tumor cells, but also triggers pronounced inflammatory immune response in the tumor tissues, which contributes to long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression after the neutron irradiation. Thus, the h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles are promising BNCT agents to eradicate tumor through highly efficient 10B accumulation.

         <title>Multistable Metafluid based Energy Harvesting and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a novel approach to energy harvesting, storage, and on&#8208;demand release by integrating compressible gas within a multistable structure. An analytical and experimental investigation is carried out into this &#8220;metafluid.&#8221; We&#160;examine its potential for energy harvesting from temperature fluctuations (such as day and night cycles), store the energy internally, and convert it into mechanical energy when needed.








Abstract
The thermodynamic properties of fluids play a crucial role in many engineering applications, particularly in the context of energy. Fluids with multistable thermodynamic properties may offer new paths for harvesting and storing energy via transitions between equilibria states. Such artificial multistable fluids can be created using the approach employed in metamaterials, which controls macro&#8208;properties through micro&#8208;structure composition. In this work, the dynamics of such &#8220;metafluids&#8221; is examined for a configuration of calorically&#8208;perfect compressible gas contained within multistable elastic capsules flowing in a fluid&#8208;filled tube. The velocity&#8208;, pressure&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;fields of multistable compressible metafluids is studied by both analytically and experimentally, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. The dynamics of a single capsule is first examine, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces. The interaction and motion of multiple capsules within a fluid&#8208;filled tube is then studied. It shows that such a system can be used to harvest energy from external temperature variations in either time or space. Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.

         <title>Nonlinear Inflatable Actuators for Distributed Control in Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces conical shell actuators that display buckling instability when loaded with pressure. The critical peak&#8208; and valley&#8208;pressures are independently tunable through geometrical parameters. When these thresholds are carefully tuned for a system of actuators, a complex actuation sequence can be designed for, with only one input. This study demonstrates this by playing Beethoven on a piano.








Abstract
As soft robotic systems grow in complexity and functionality, the size and stiffness of the needed control hardware severely limits their application potential. Alternatively, functionality can be embodied within actuator characteristics, drastically reducing the amount of peripherals. Functions such as memory, computation, and energy storage then result from the intrinsic mechanical behavior of precisely designed structures. Here, actuators are introduced with tunable characteristics to generate complex actuation sequences from a single input. Intricate sequences are made possible by harnessing hysteron characteristics encoded in the buckling of a cone&#8208;shaped shell incorporated in the actuator design. A large variety of such characteristics are generated by varying the actuator geometry. This dependency is mapped and used for creating a tool to determine the actuator geometry that yields a desired characteristic. Using this tool, a system with six actuators is created that plays the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with a single pressure supply.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Josephson Weak&#8208;Links in Monolayer WTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) can be both a quantum spin Hall insulator and gated into a superconducting state. Josephson weak&#8208;links are fabricated using local gates on hBN&#8208;encapsulated WTe2 and the 2D nature of the superconducting leads is demonstrated. The fabrication provides a first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one gate configurable topological Josephson weak&#8208;links.








Abstract
Systems combining superconductors with topological insulators offer a platform for the study of Majorana bound states and a possible route to realize fault tolerant topological quantum computation. Among the systems being considered in this field, monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) have a rare combination of properties. Notably, it has been demonstrated to be a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) and can easily be gated into a superconducting state. Measurements on gate&#8208;defined Josephson weak&#8208;link devices fabricated using monolayer WTe2 are reported. It is found that consideration of the 2D superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. The reported fabrication procedures suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically challenging material and the results mark the first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one topological Josephson weak&#8208;links using monolayer WTe2.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Thermoelectric Microdevices for 4D Thermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device is developed for direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale. The paradigm of a 3D&#8208;printed thermocouple micro&#8208;network provides new advantages to access microscopic thermodynamics without dimensional limit. In this study, microscale 4D temperature fields generated by Joule&#8208;heating or evaporative cooling are directly observed.








Abstract
Thermometry, the process of measuring temperature, is one of the most fundamental tasks not only for understanding the thermodynamics of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes but also for thermal management of microelectronics. However, it is a challenge to acquire microscale temperature fields in both space and time. Here, a 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device that enables direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale is reported. The device is composed of freestanding thermocouple probe networks, fabricated by bi&#8208;metal 3D printing with an outstanding spatial resolution of a few &#181;m. It shows that the developed 4D thermometry can explore dynamics of Joule heating or evaporative cooling on microscale subjects of interest such as a microelectrode or a water meniscus. The utilization of 3D printing further opens up the possibility to freely realize a wide range of on&#8208;chip, freestanding microsensors or microelectronic devices without the design restrictions by manufacturing processes.

         <title>Directed Neural Stem Cells Differentiation via Signal Communication with Ni&#8211;Zn Micromotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotors precisely approach target neural stem cells (NSCs) under magnetic guidance and further activate the cellular voltage&#8208;gated ion channel, thus directing the differentiation fate of the target cell. Such micromotors provide a possibility for non&#8208;invasive, minimally invasive therapy for neuron regeneration.








Abstract
Neural stem cells (NSCs), with the capability of self&#8208;renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy, and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous NSCs, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogenous cell transplantation. Yet, how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, a pure water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor via a self&#8208;established electric&#8211;chemical field is proposed. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target NSCs. Through the electric&#8211;chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous NSCs are allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, the Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via a self&#8208;established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous NSCs.

         <title>Buckling Metamaterials for Extreme Vibration Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. It is shown that allowing buckling of the primary load path can be used to set an upper limit for vibration transmission. In free&#8208;standing mechanical metamaterials, this principle is used to generate extreme vibration damping with very high stiffness, far exceeding typical values for lightweight structural materials.








Abstract
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. Many passive damping methods rely on using low stiffness, complex mechanical structures or electrical systems, which render them unfeasible in many of these applications. Herein, a new method for passive vibration damping, by allowing buckling of the primary load path in mechanical metamaterials and lattice structures, is introduced, which sets an upper limit for vibration transmission: the transmitted&#160;acceleration saturates at a maximum value in both tension and compression, no matter what the input acceleration is. This nonlinear mechanism leads to an extreme damping coefficient tan&#948; &#8776; 0.23 in a metal metamaterial&#8212;orders of magnitude larger than the linear damping coefficient of traditional lightweight structural materials. This principle is demonstrated experimentally and numerically in free&#8208;standing rubber and metal mechanical metamaterials over a range of accelerations. It is also shown that damping nonlinearities even allow buckling&#8208;based vibration damping to work in tension, and that bidirectional buckling can further improve its performance. Buckling metamaterials pave the way toward extreme vibration damping without mass or stiffness penalty, and, as such, could be applicable in a multitude of high&#8208;tech applications, including aerospace, vehicles, and sensitive&#160;instruments.

         <title>Delocalized Electronic Engineering of Ni5P4 Nanoroses for Durable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>

Nitrogen heteroatoms are introduced to effectively induce electron delocalization and construction of strong electronegative centers of nickel phosphide, significantly decreasing the energy barrier for efficient oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and issues associated with the parasitic reactions of cathodes are major obstacles to the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs), despite their large theoretical energy density. Therefore, efficient electrocatalyst design is critical for optimizing their performance. Ni5P4 is analyzed theoretically as a cathode material, and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center is found to enhance electron occupation in antibonding orbits, providing a valuable descriptor for understanding and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this study, it is demonstrated that incorporating additional nitrogen atoms into Ni5P4 nanoroses regulates the electronic structure, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance in LOBs. Further spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporated nitrogen sites can effectively induce localized structure polarization, lowering the energy barrier for the production of desirable intermediates and thus enhancing battery capacity and preventing cell degradation. This approach provides a sound basis for developing advanced electrode materials with optimized electronic structures for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>A Gas/phototheranostic Nanocomposite Integrates NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Peak Absorbing Aza&#8208;BODIPY with Thermal&#8208;Sensitive Nitric Oxide Donor for Atraumatic Osteosarcoma Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work, an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is engineered to obtain the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY), combining with a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor to form a gas/phototheranostics. This gas/phototheranostics that combines gas therapy with low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy executes the therapeutic mechanism of enhanced cell apoptosis for osteosarcoma, simultaneously, achieving an atraumatic therapeutic process.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has received increasing interest in cancer therapeutics owing to its excellent efficacy and controllability. However, there are two major limitations in PTT applications, which are the tissue penetration depth of lasers within the absorption range of photothermal agents and the unavoidable tissue empyrosis induced by high&#8208;energy lasers. Herein, a gas/phototheranostic nanocomposite (NA1020&#8208;NO@PLX) is engineered that integrates the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY,NA1020) with the thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine, SNAP). An enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is proposed to achieve the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak absorbance (&#955;max = 1020&#160;nm) on NA1020, thereby obtaining its deep tissue penetration depth. The NA1020 exhibits a remarkable photothermal conversion, making it feasible for the deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy and providing favorable NIR&#8208;II emission to precisely pinpoint the tumor for a visible PTT process. The simultaneously investigated atraumatic therapeutic process with an enhanced cell apoptosis mechanism indicates the feasibility of the synergistic NO/low&#8208;temperature PTT for osteosarcoma. Herein, this gas/phototheranostic strategy optimizes the existing PTT to present a repeatable and atraumatic photothermal therapeutic process for deep&#8208;tissue tumors, validating its potential clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature, Reversible, and Robust Thermochromic Fluorescence Based on Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are demonstrated in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals. Such unique features showcase a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption application.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) characterized by noticeable emission color variation with temperature have attracted pervasive attention for their frontier application in stimulus&#8208;response and optical encryption technologies. However, existing TFMs typically suffer from weak PL reversibility as well as limited mild operating temperature and severe temperature PL quenching. PL switching under extreme conditions such as high temperature will undoubtedly improve encryption security, while it is still challenging for present TFMs. In this work, high&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are observed in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals, which is seldom reported for PL changes at such a high temperature. Temperature&#8208;driven nonluminous, red and green light emission states can be achieved at specific temperatures and the modulation mechanism is verified by in situ optical and structural measurements and single particle transition. By virtue of this unique feature, a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption applications are demonstrated. This work opens a window for the design of inorganic materials with multi&#8208;PL change and the development of advanced encryption strategies with extreme stimuli source.

         <title>All&#8208;Day Multicyclic Atmospheric Water Harvesting Enabled by Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel with Hybrid Desorption Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with free and coordinated hygroscopic salt is described, which exhibits fast sorption due to the large interior osmotic pressure and prevention of salt aggregation and leakage through the strong salt&#8211;polymer electrostatic interactions. By using a multicyclic operation strategy and a hybrid desorption mode, the sorbent achieves high&#8208;yield water production, outperforming single&#8208;cyclic solar&#8208;driven mode by three times.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising approach for mitigating worldwide water scarcity. However, reliable water supply driven by sustainable energy regardless of diurnal variation and weather remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. To address this issue, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with an optimal hybrid&#8208;desorption multicyclic&#8208;operation strategy is proposed, achieving all&#8208;day AWH and a significant increase in daily water production. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel possesses a large interior osmotic pressure of 659 atm, which refreshes sorption sites by continuously migrating the sorbed water within its interior, and thus enhancing sorption kinetics. The charged polymeric chains coordinate with hygroscopic salt ions, anchoring the salts and preventing agglomeration and leakage, thereby enhancing cyclic stability. The hybrid desorption mode, which couples solar energy and simulated waste heat, introduces a uniform and adjustable sorbent temperature for achieving all&#8208;day ultrafast water release. With rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, an optimization model suggests that eight moisture capture&#8211;release cycles are capable of achieving&#160;high water yield of 2410 mLwater kgsorbent&#8722;1 day&#8722;1, up to 3.5 times that of single&#8208;cyclic non&#8208;hybrid modes. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent and the coupling with sustainable energy driven desorption mode pave the way for the next&#8208;generation AWH systems, significantly bringing freshwater on a multi&#8208;kilogram scale closer.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of energy offset and defects with different halide types in 2D perovskite are studied, providing a new approach for designing stable and efficient PSCs. Using 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions can improve the passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction, boosting the efficiency to 25.32% for the small devices and 21.48% for the large module.








Abstract
Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by chargecarrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, 2D perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small&#8208;size devices and to 21.48% for a large&#8208;area module (with a designated area of 29.0&#160;cm2). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small&#8208;size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.

     alt="Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of energy offset and defects with different halide types in 2D perovskite are studied, providing a new approach for designing stable and efficient PSCs. Using 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions can improve the passivation and charge-carrier extraction, boosting the efficiency to 25.32% for the small devices and 21.48% for the large module.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by chargecarrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high-efficiency PSCs, 2D perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge-carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small-size devices and to 21.48% for a large-area module (with a designated area of 29.0&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small-size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paintable Physical Unclonable Functions using DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA liquid crystals (LCs), which are extracted from nature, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, are used as a paint for anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. The entropy&#8208;driven instability in the evaporation process of DNA LCs induces a stochastic birefringent pattern that provides high&#8208;level security codes based on physical unclonable functions. The platform can allow the fabrication&#160;of protective barriers with a simple method, brushstrokes.








Abstract
Controversy over artwork's authenticity is ongoing despite numerous technologies for copyright protection. Artists should build their own ways to protect the authority, but these are still open to piracy. Here, a platform is proposed for developing anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), in an artist&#8208;friendly manner, brushstrokes. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is natural, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, can be applied as a paint that shows entropy&#8208;driven buckling instability of the liquid crystal phase. Brushed and wholly dried DNA exhibits line&#8208;shaped zig&#8208;zag textures with inherent randomness as a source of the PUF, and its primary performance and reliability are systematically examined. This breakthrough enables the utilization of these drawings in a wider range of applications.

         <title>An Artificial Olfactory System Based on a Chemi&#8208;Memristive Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hysteretic chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor containing TiO2&#8208;nanorod memristors based on oxygen vacancy dynamics different from that of conventional sensors is developed. Analog conductance modulation based on the redox reaction with external gas molecules in a ruptured filament area after memristive switching converts external gas stimuli into synaptic weights to realize an artificial olfactory system.








Abstract
Technologies based on the fusion of gas sensors and neuromorphic computing to mimic the olfactory system have immense potential. However, the implementation of neuromorphic olfactory systems remains in a state of infancy because conventional gas sensors lack the necessary functions. Therefore, this study proposes a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. After the memristive switching operation, the redox reaction with the external gas molecules is enhanced, resulting in the generation and elimination of oxygen vacancies that induce rapid current changes. In addition, the pre&#8208;generated oxygen vacancies enhance the post&#8208;sensing properties. Therefore, fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response are achieved by the proposed sensor at room temperature. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated as a potential application. Moreover, analog conductance modulation induced by oxidizing and reducing gases enables the conversion of external gas stimuli into synaptic weights and hence the realization of typical synaptic functionalities without an additional device or circuit. The proposed chemi&#8208;memristive device represents an advance in the bioinspired technology adopted in creating artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Seeded Synthesis of Hollow PdSn Intermetallic Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded method is developed to prepare hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles, i.e., orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2, based on rational modulation of phase and morphology. The obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles with modified electronic structure, high intrinsic activity, and abundant active sites exhibit excellent catalytic performances toward electrochemical glycerol oxidation, outperforming hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 and solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles.








Abstract
Intermetallic nanomaterials have shown promising potential as high&#8208;performance catalysts in various catalytic reactions due to their unconventional crystal phases with ordered atomic arrangements. However, controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with tunable crystal phases and unique hollow morphologies remains a challenge. Here, a seeded method is developed to synthesize hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with two different intermetallic phases, that is, orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2. Benefiting from the rational regulation of the crystal phase and morphology, the obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs deliver excellent electrocatalytic performance toward glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), outperforming solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs, hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 NPs, and commercial Pd/C, which places it among the best reported Pd&#8208;based GOR electrocatalysts. The reaction mechanism of GOR using the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn as the catalyst is investigated by operando infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, which reveals that the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn catalyst cleaves the C&#63743;C bond more easily compared to the commercial Pd/C. This work can pave an appealing route to the controlled synthesis of diverse novel intermetallic nanomaterials with hollow morphology for various promising applications.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Molecular Dynamics Elucidates the Mechanics of Reinforcement in Graphene&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of reinforcement of polymer materials by graphene&#8208;based inclusions is highly important for the design of high&#8208;performance composites. Very large molecular simulations show that single graphene layers can effectively reinforce the polymer matrix via a shear&#8208;lag process down to flake sizes of 500 nm, as long as the flake is predominantly flat. However, even small undulations of the surface substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.








Abstract
Using very large&#8208;scale classical molecular dynamics, the mechanics of nano&#8208;reinforcement of graphene&#8208;based nanocomposites are &#160;examined. Simulations show that significant quantities of large, defect&#8208;free, and predominantly flat graphene flakes are required for successful enhancement of materials properties in excellent agreement with experimental and proposed continuum shear&#8208;lag theories. The critical lengths for enhancement are approximately 500 nm for graphene and 300 nm and for graphene oxide (GO). The reduction of Young's modulus in GO results in a much smaller enhancement of the composite's Young's modulus. The simulations reveal that the flakes should be aligned and planar for optimal reinforcement. Undulations substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.

         <title>Polyimides Physically Crosslinked by Aromatic Molecules Exhibit Ultrahigh Energy Density at 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost breakdown strength and trap charge carriers to suppress dielectric loss. An ultrahigh Ud of 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and superior cyclic stability at 200&#160;&#176;C are achieved in the all&#8208;organic composites.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess significant advantages in electrostatic energy storage applications, such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while their discharged energy density (Ud) at high temperature is limited by the decrease in Eb and &#951;. Several strategies including introducing inorganic components and crosslinking have been investigated to improve the Ud of polymer dielectrics, but new issues will be encountered, e.g., the sacrifice of flexibility, the degradation of the interfacial insulating property and the complex preparation process. In this work, 3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost the Eb, and the aromatic molecules trap the charge carriers to suppress the loss, allowing the strategy to combine the advantages of inorganic incorporation and crosslinking. This study demonstrates that this strategy is well applicable to a number of representative aromatic polyimides, and ultrahigh Ud of 8.05&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (150&#160;&#176;C) and 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (200&#160;&#176;C) is achieved. Furthermore, the all&#8208;organic composites exhibit stable performances during ultralong 105 charge&#8211;discharge cycles in harsh environments (500&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 200&#160;&#176;C) and prospects for large&#8208;scale preparation.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Featuring Single Molybdenum Atoms in a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multicomponent core&#8211;shell structures presents a versatile route to produce bifunctional molybdenum&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts. Zinc&#8211;air batteries with such multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, significantly outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks.








Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts can facilitate two different electrochemical reactions with conflicting characteristics. Here, a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is reported featuring a &#8220;core&#8211;shell structure&#8221; in which N&#8208;doped graphene sheets wrap around vanadium molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles. Single Mo atoms are released from the particle core during synthesis and anchored to electronegative N&#8208;dopant species in the graphitic shell. The resultant Mo single&#8208;atom catalysts excel as active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites in pyrrolic&#8208;N and as active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites in pyridinic&#8208;N environments. ZABs with such bifunctional and multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Flexible ZABs that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 80&#160;&#176;C) under severe mechanical deformation are also demonstrated

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through innovative molecular design and advanced device optimization, a high&#8208;performance electrochromic device is achieved, demonstrating high transparency, rapid color&#8208;switching, and excellent stability. In conjunction with the creation of a thermoresponsive gel electrolyte, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is realized, exhibiting flame&#8208;retardant properties and energy&#8208;saving characteristics. Such an advanced device equips smart windows with energy efficiency, privacy protection, and decorative enhancements.








Abstract
Smart windows nowadays undertake the esteemed obligation of reducing energy consumption as well as upgrading living experience. This project aims to devise a smart window that responds to both electricity and heat, with the intention of achieving energy efficiency, privacy preservation, and enhanced decorative attributes. Through the implementation of a novel electrochromic material design, coupled with the optimization of electrochromic devices (ECDs), a high&#8208;performance ECD is obtained, demonstrating coloring/bleaching time of 0.53/0.16&#160;s, a transmittance modulation of 78% (from 99% to 21%), and superior performance in six dimensions. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;responsive units and an ionic liquid are incorporated into the electrolyte system to create a novel thermochromic gel electrolyte with transmittance modulation from 80% to 0%, and excellent thermal insulation (6.4&#160;&#176;C reduction). Ultimately, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is developed, featuring an ultrafast color&#8208;switching speed of 0.82/0.60&#160;s and multiple working modes. Overall, this work showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of next&#8208;generation ultrafast&#8208;switching, and energy&#8208;efficient intelligent windows.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen&#8208;Related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;related defects with unpaired electrons are constructed in carbon dots via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, which not only contribute to the enhanced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to noninvasive NIR fluorescent imaging and effective photocatalytic therapy.








Abstract
Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high&#8208;performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, a facile approach to introducing oxygen&#8208;related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid is reported, in which some nitrogen atoms are substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen&#8208;related defects rearrange the electronic structure of the oxidized CDs (ox&#8208;CDs), resulting in an emerging near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contribute to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo&#8208;generated holes on the ox&#8208;CDs surface under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo&#8208;generated holes oxidize hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals are detected in the ox&#8208;CDs aqueous solution under 730&#160;nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox&#8208;CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT are demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the asymmetric structural features and functions of finger skin, an innovative PU&#8208;TA@MXene sensing film with bionic Janus architecture is proposed by a simple but ingenious gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, and the derived flexible sensor reveals strong mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing ability, and well&#8208;selective response behavior to normal pressure, stretching, and directional bending.








Abstract
Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties are always a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra&#8208;derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, a novel tannic acid (TA)&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;polyurethane film with a bionic Janus architecture is proposed, which is prepared by gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at a break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self&#8208;healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure, and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor is endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor. This work offers essential research value and practical significance for the material structures, mechanical properties, and application platforms of flexible sensors.

         <title>Thin&#8208;Film Organic Heteroepitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems have not been fully clarified. In this work, one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate heteroepitaxy is demonstrated and it is shown that the lattice matched plane of the adcrystal must also be its lowest energy surface.








Abstract
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, while rules for commensurate epitaxy of covalent or ionic inorganic material systems are known to be dictated by lattice matching constraints, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems are still being written. Here, it is found that lattice matching alone is insufficient to achieve heteroepitaxy in molecular systems, owing to weak intermolecular forces that describe molecular crystals. It is found that, in addition, the lattice matched plane also must be the lowest energy surface of the adcrystal to achieve one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate molecular heteroepitaxy over a large area. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the lattice matched interface to be of higher electronic quality than a disordered interface of the same materials.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Electrochemically Promoting Lithium Atom Diffusion and Relieving Accumulative Stress for Deep&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile stress can be incorporated into lithium metal anodes to reduce lithium atom diffusion energy barrier by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium through copolymer thinning. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8208;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) can double the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious lithium dendrite growth and large volume change are not well addressed, especially under deep cycling. Here, an in&#8211;situ mechanical&#8211;electrochemical coupling system is built, and it is found that tensile stress can induce smooth lithium deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and finite element method (FEM) simulation confirm that the lithium atom diffusion energy barrier can be reduced when the lithium foils are under tensile strain. Then tensile stress is incorporated into lithium metal anodes by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium in which the copolymer thinning can yield tensile stress to the lithium foil. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8211;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation. The ELMA can withstand hundreds of compression&#8208;release cycles under 10% strain. LMBs paired with ELMA and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can operate beyond 250 cycles with 80% capacity retention under practical condition of 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode capacity, 2.86&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C) and 1.8 negative&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio (N/P), five times of the lifetime using lithium foils.

         <title>Flexible Modulation of Cellular Activities with Cationic Photosensitizers: Insights of Alkyl Chain Length on Reactive Oxygen Species Antimicrobial Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) with berberine (BBR) cores with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed for different binding, localization, and photodynamic killing effects among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility.








Abstract
Cationic photosensitizers have good binding ability with negatively charged bacteria and fungi, exhibiting broad applications potential in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). However, cationic photosensitizers often display unsatisfactory transkingdom selectivity between mammalian cells and pathogens, especially for eukaryotic fungi. It is unclear which biomolecular sites are more efficient for photodynamic damage, owing to the lack of systematic research with the same photosensitizer system. Herein, a series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) (using berberine (BBR) as the photosensitizers core) with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed and synthesized for flexible modulation of cellular activities. The BBR core can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve high&#8208;performance aPDT . Through the precise regulation of alkyl chain length, different bindings, localizations, and photodynamic killing effects of CABs are achieved and investigated systematically among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. It is found that intracellular active substances, not membranes, are more efficient damage sites of aPDT. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility. This study is expected to provide systematic theoretical and strategic research guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance cationic photosensitizers with good transkingdom selectivity.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals are developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species, release of La ions, and the activation of inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cell death and inhibit metastasis during lung cancer.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics are rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endow LCO with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibits catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroy the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LCO&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte is reported, wherein Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarization is known as a promising way to promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since the intermediates and products endow spin&#8208;dependent behaviors, yet it is rarely reported for ferromagnetic catalysts toward acidic OER practically used in industry. Herein, the first spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte. Element&#8208;selective X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Ru ions, fulfilling the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori rule. The ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature can be well interpreted by first principles calculations as the interaction between the Mn2+ impurity and Ru ions. Indeed, Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic field enhanced OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 143&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 and negligible activity decay in 480&#160;h stability (vs 200&#160;mV/195&#160;h without magnetic field) as known for magnetic effects in the literature. The intrinsic turnover frequency is also improved to reach 5.5 s&#8722;1 at 1.45 VRHE. This work highlights an important avenue of spin&#8208;engineering strategy for designing efficient acidic oxygen evolution catalysts.

         <title>Eye&#8208;Mimicked Neural Network Composed of Photosensitive Neural Spheroids with Human Opsin Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain mimicking model is designed with photosensitive neural spheroid and neural network. In the photosensitive neural spheroid, human opins such as rhodopsin and short&#8208;wavelength opsin are reacted by the specific wavelength of light with selective sensitivity. Photonic reaction result in the neural response, of which signal spread to other neurons through axons.








Abstract
An&#160;in vitro model, composed of the short&#8208;wavelength human opsins and rhodopsins, is created. Two types of photosensitive neural spheroids are transfected for selective reaction under bluish&#8208;purple and green lights. These are employed to two devices with intact neuron and neural&#8208;spheroid to study the interaction. By photostimulation, the photosensitive spheroid initiated photoactivation, and the signal generated from its body is transmitted to adjacent neural networks. Specifically, the signal traveled through the axon bundle in narrow gap from photosensitive spheroid to intact spheroid as an eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain model including optic nerve. The whole process with photosensitive spheroid is monitored by calcium ion detecting fluorescence images. The results of this study can be applied to examine vision restoration and novel photosensitive biological systems with spectral sensitivity.

         <title>Optical Fibers Embedded with As&#8208;Grown Carbon Nanotubes for Ultrahigh Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with narrow diameter distribution on the inner walls of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) by a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is developed. By using the as&#8208;fabricated 3&#8208;cm&#8208;long CNT&#8208;fibers with desirable nanotube optical transitions, both third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been largely enhanced and mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser has been fabricated with a stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate.








Abstract
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors. Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibers by ex situ transfer method; however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage. Here, the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method is reported. A two&#8208;step growth method is&#160;developed to control the narrow diameter distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNT&#8208; embedded fiber, third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been enhanced by &#8776;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. A dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fiber mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8776;1561 and &#8776;1064&#160;nm) is further demonstrated by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diameter CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap hollow core PCF&#160;(named HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8776;0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8776;1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fiber laser shows stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. These&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

         <title>New Function of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Structurally Ordered Metal Promoter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted post&#8208;modification strategy is developed to anchor dozen kinds of metal ions into metal&#8211;organic framework composites as structurally ordered metal promoters, which not only contributes to constructing ideal catalyst models for elucidating action mechanism of metal promoters during the catalytic process, but also provides a universal method to synthesize high&#8208;efficiency catalysts.








Abstract
The remarkable roles of metal promoters have been known for nearly a century, but it is still a challenge to find a suitable structure model to reveal the action mechanism behind metal promoters. Herein, a new function of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed as an ideal model to construct structurally ordered metal promoters by a targeted post&#8208;modification strategy. MOFs as model not only favor clearing the real action mechanism behind metal promoters, but also can anchor one or multiple kinds of metal promoters especially noble metal promoters. Typically, the as&#8208;prepared Pd/bpy&#8208;UiO&#8208;Cu catalysts show high selectivity (&gt;99%) toward 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane in 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation, mainly due to the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and MOF carriers induced by Cu promoters, thus inhibiting the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane. This strategy with flexibility and universality will open up a new route to synthesize efficient catalysts with structurally ordered metal promoters.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Mechanical Bilayer Metamaterial with Global Area&#8208;Preserving Density Tunability for Acoustic Wave Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented 2D metamaterial consists of two layers that are actuated separately by a remotely applied magnetic field. This novel bilayer design strategy enables the adjustment of the area density while simultaneously preserving the overall dimensions. These designs can be further exploited in acoustic applications, including highly tunable bandgaps and waveguides.








Abstract
2D metamaterials have immense potential in acoustics, optics, and electromagnetic applications due to their unique properties and ability to conform to curved substrates. Active metamaterials have attracted significant research attention because of their on&#8208;demand tunable properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. 2D active metamaterials often achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which lead to changes in overall dimensions. This demands corresponding alterations of the conforming substrate, or the metamaterial fails to provide complete area coverage, which can be a significant limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area&#8208;preserving active 2D metamaterials with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent challenge. In this paper, magneto&#8208;mechanical bilayer metamaterials are presented that demonstrate area density tunability with area&#8208;preserving capability. The bilayer metamaterials consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials with distinct magnetization distributions. Under a magnetic field, each layer behaves differently, which allows the metamaterial to reconfigure its shape into multiple modes and to significantly tune its area density without changing its overall dimensions. The area&#8208;preserving multimodal shape reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new concept for the design of area&#8208;preserving active metamaterials for broader applications.

         <title>Induction of Tumor Ferroptosis&#8208;Dependent Immunity via an Injectable Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver RSL&#8208;3, a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)&#160;antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water. RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells through cascade amplification and elicits antitumor immune responses via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells in tumors with low immunogenicity.








Abstract
The combination of ferroptosis inducers and immune checkpoint blockade can enhance antitumor effects. However, the efficacy in tumors with low immunogenicity requires further investigation. In this work, a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver (1S, 3R)&#8208;RSL&#8208;3 (RSL&#8208;3), a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) antibody, the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water, with optimal characteristics (RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel). Tumor lipase degrades the continuous oil phase, which results in the slow release of RSL&#8208;3&#160;and PD&#8208;1&#160;antibody and a notable antitumor effect against low&#8208;immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells, resulting in antitumor immune response via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the single&#8208;cell sequence profiling analysis during tumor treatment reveals the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells together with strong antitumor immune response in ascites.

         <title>Strong Magnetically&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence and X&#8208;Ray Scintillation in Ultrarobust Mn(II)&#8211;Organic Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrarobust helical Mn(II)&#8208;organic polymers are developed to realize magnetically&#8208;responsive circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with exceptionally high performance (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;89%, glum&#160;=&#160;0.021) as well as triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity.&#160;We&#160;have disclosed that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPP for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPP signal noticeably.








Abstract
Over recent years, Mn(II)&#8208;organic materials showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great interest because of their eco&#8208;friendliness, cheapness, and room temperature phosphorescence. Using the helicity design strategy, herein, chiral Mn(II)&#8208;organic helical polymers are constructed featuring long&#8208;lived circularly polarized phosphorescence with exceptionally high glum and &#934;PL magnitudes of 0.021% and 89%, respectively, while remaining ultrarobust toward humidity, temperature, and X&#8208;rays. Equally important, it is disclosed for the first time that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPL for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPL signal by 4.2&#8208;times at B&#8407;$\vec{B}$&#160;=&#160;1.6&#160;T. Using the designed materials, UV&#8208;pumped CPL light&#8208;emitting diodes are fabricated, demonstrating enhanced optical selectivity under right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed polarization conditions. On top of all this, the reported materials display bright triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity with a perfectly linear X&#8208;ray dose rate response up to 174&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1. Overall, these observations significantly contribute to the CPL phenomenon for multi&#8208;spin compounds and promote the design of highly efficient and stable Mn(II)&#8208;based CPL emitters.

         <title>Sequential Molecule&#8208;Doped Hole Conductor to Achieve &gt;23% Perovskite Solar Cells with 3000&#8208;Hour Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport layers (HTLs) is being held back by poor stability and unsatisfied scalability. Herein, a versatile molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping approach is developed to improve the spatial doping uniformity and fabricate all&#8208;evaporated HTL. The resultant devices achieve a record efficiency of 23.4%, and exhibit impressive stability both in ambient and working conditions.








Abstract
Although hole transport layers (HTLs) based on solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD are extremely popular and effective for their remarkable performance in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their scalable application is still being held back by poor chemical stability and unsatisfied scalability. Essentially, the volatile components and hygroscopic nature of ionic salts often cause morphological deformation that deteriorate both device efficiency and stability. Herein, a simple and effective molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping (MISD) approach is strategically introduced to modulate spatial doping uniformity of organic films and fabricate all evaporated Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD layer in which phase&#8208;segregation free HTL is achieved accompanied with high molecular density, uniform doping composition, and superior optoelectronic characteristics. The resultant MISD&#8208;based devices attain a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4%, which represents the highest reported value among all the PSCs with evaporated HTLs. Simultaneously, the unencapsulated devices realize considerably enhanced stability by maintaining over 90% of their initial PCEs in the air for 5200&#160;h and after working at maximum power point under illumination for 3000&#160;h. This method provides a facile way to fabricate robust and reliable HTLs toward developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles&#8208;Derived Hybrid Nanoplatforms for Amplified CD47 Blockade&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanoplatforms are designed by fusing M1 macrophage extracellular vesicles with drug&#8208;loaded liposomes and decorating them with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, which enables amplified CD47 blockade&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy through combinational treatment strategy.








Abstract
Immunomodulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) into tumor&#8208;inhibiting M1&#8208;like phenotype is a promising but challenging strategy. Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re&#8208;education of TAMs into the &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy. Herein, it is reported that hybrid nanovesicles (hEL&#8208;RS17) derived from extracellular vesicles of M1 macrophages and decorated with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, can actively target tumor cells and remodel TAM phenotypes. Consequently, more M1&#8208;like TAMs infiltrate into tumor tissue to phagocytize more tumor cells due to CD47 blockade. By further co&#8208;encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent shikonin, photosensitizer IR820, and immunomodulator polymetformin in hEL&#8208;RS17, an enhanced antitumor effect is obtained due to the combinational treatment modality and close synergy among each component. Upon laser irradiation, the designed SPI@hEL&#8208;RS17 nanoparticles exert potent antitumor efficacy against both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, which not only suppresses primary tumor growth but also inhibits lung metastasis and prevents tumor recurrence, exhibiting great potential in boosting CD47 blockade&#8208;based antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>A Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lightweight Al battery is constructed using a dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and a high&#8208;loading integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF induce Al deposition. The zero&#8208;volume expansion of the GCAF results in better stability. A CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery exhibits excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance toward fast storage of fluctuating electricity.








Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode is con&#8208;firmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode is almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density are obtained. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes can promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

         <title>How to Adequately Describe Full Range Intercalation&#8212;A Two&#8208;Sided Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate description of the cell voltage of an intercalation electrode succeeds by applying defect thermodynamics near the ordered compositions. At large deviations thermodynamic interpolation (as indicated in the figure) or non&#8208;ideal statistics is required. Literature data on nanocrystalline LixFePO4 are reproduced where the entire range is realized, but other materials can be described analogously (i, n, v, and p stand for interstitial Li+, excess electrons, Li+ vacancies, electron holes; C&#948; denotes the chemical capacitance; electronic defects are not shown in the figure).








Abstract
One of the key challenges in battery research is to quantitatively describe the intercalation storage capacity as a function of the reversible cell voltage. The reason that such endeavors are not yet very successful, lies in the lack of an adequate charge carrier treatment. Using the most challenging example of nanocrystalline lithium iron phosphate, where the full range from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is accessible without miscibility gap, this study shows how a quantitative description of literature results can be achieved even for such a huge window. For this purpose, point&#8208;defect thermodynamics is applied and the problem is tackled from the two end&#8208;member sides including saturation effects. A first, rather heuristic treatment interpolates in&#8208;between using the safe thermodynamic criterion of local phase stability. Already this straightforward approach works very satisfactorily. In order to also gain mechanistic insight, interactions among and between ions and electrons have to be taken account of. This study shows how to implement them into the analysis.

         <title>Quantifying Charge Extraction and Recombination Using the Rise and Decay of the Transient Photovoltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise time of transient photovoltage measurements on halide perovskite solar cells is used to quantify charge extraction. As the decay time of the photovoltage can be used to quantify recombination, the combination of rise and decay provides a complete analysis of recombination and extraction and its impact on photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. Herein, a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential equations that are solved analytically by determining the eigenvalues of a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay times during a transient photovoltage measurement, the rates of carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage are determined, and establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the perovskite solar cell.

         <title>Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom and Clustered Catalysts Outperform Benchmark Pt for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium cobalt oxide substrate provides active sites for the dissociation of water, and the generated H intermediates recombine to generate H2 on the Ru single atoms or clusters. Comparing the two kinds of Ru sites, Ru cluster dominates the alkaline HER activity due to the more fluent migration of H intermediates and its more favorable adsorption&#8211;desorption energetics toward H intermediates.








Abstract
Guaranteeing satisfactory catalytic behavior while ensuring high metal utilization has become the problem that needs to be addressed when designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical reactions. Here, well&#8208;dispersed ruthenium (Ru) based clusters with adjacent Ru single atoms (SAs) on layered sodium cobalt oxide (Ru/NC) are demonstrated as a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The Ru/NC catalyst demonstrates an activity increase by a factor of two relative to the commercial Pt/C. Operando characterizations in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) simulations uncover the origin of the superior activity and establish a structure&#8211;performance relationship, that is, under HER condition, the real active species are Ru SAs and metallic Ru clusters supported on the NC substrate. The excellent alkaline HER activity of the Ru/NC catalyst can be understood by a spatially decoupled water dissociation and hydrogen desorption mechanism, where the NC substrate accelerates the water dissociation rate, and the generated H intermediates would then migrate to the Ru SAs or clusters and recombine to have H2 evolution. More importantly, comparing the two forms of Ru sites, it is the Ru cluster that dominates the HER activity.

         <title>A Multifunctional Additive Strategy Enables Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate performs three functions on perovskites: dimensionality control, defect passivation, and surface modification. Consequently, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 11.87% at 468&#160;nm, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have shown exceptional performance in light&#8208;emitting devices (PeLEDs), particularly in producing significant electroluminescence in sky&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. However, PeLEDs emitting pure&#8208;blue light at 465&#8211;475 nm are still not satisfactory. Herein, efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are reported by controlling phase distribution, passivation of defects, as well as surface modifications using multifunctional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate (PEATFA) in reduced&#8208;dimensional p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA2Csn&#8722;1Pbn(Br0.55Cl0.45)3n+1 polycrystalline perovskite films. Compared with 4&#8208;fluorophenylethylammonium (p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA+) in the pristine films, phenylethylammonium (PEA+) has lower adsorption energy while interacting with perovskites, resulting in large&#8208;n low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, which can greatly facilitate charge transport within the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films. The interaction between the C&#63742;O group in trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) and perovskites significantly reduces defects in the perovskite films. Additionally, the electron&#8208;giving &#63743;CF3 group in TFA&#8208; uplifts surface potential in the films, resulting in smooth electronic injection in devices. The multifunctional additive strategy leads to elevated radiative recombination and efficient carrier transport in the films and devices. As a result, the devices exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.87% at 468 nm with stable spectral output, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Thus, this study extends the way for high&#8208;efficiency pure&#8208;blue LED with perovskite polycrystal films.

         <title>Synergetic Enhancement of Strength&#8211;Ductility and Thermoelectric Properties of Ag2Te by Domain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanodomain strategy for improving the mechanical and thermoelectric properties of materials simultaneously is presented. Ag2Te with suppressed lattice thermal conductivity and improved strength&#8211;ductility synergy is achieved. These findings provide new insights into grain and domain boundary engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical strength&#8211;ductility synergy.








Abstract
Simultaneously improving the mechanical and thermoelectric (TE) properties is significant for the engineering applications of inorganic TE materials. In this work, a novel nanodomain strategy is developed for Ag2Te compounds to yield 40% and 200% improved compressive strength (160&#160;MPa) and fracture strain (16%) when compared to domain&#8208;free samples (115&#160;MPa and 5.5%, respectively). The domained samples also achieve a 45% improvement in average ZT value. The domain boundaries (DBs) provide extra sites for dislocation nucleation while pinning the dislocation movement, resulting in superior strength and ductility. In addition, phonon scattering induced by DBs suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity of Ag2Te and also reduces the weighted mobility. These findings provide new insights into grain and DB engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical properties.

Active Metamaterials
In article number 2303541, Ruike Renee Zhao and co&#8208;workers present a novel magneto&#8208;mechanical metamaterial that employs a double&#8208;layer design to change area density while preserving the overall area for good conformability during actuation. Magnetic actuation facilitates rapid and reversible structural deformation between multiple modes. This allows for the metamaterial to control the propagation of in&#8208;plane elastic waves of different frequencies.

Physical Unclonable Functions
In article number 2302135, Dong Ki Yoon and co&#8208;workers present a framework for the creation of physical unclonable function (PUF)&#8208;based authentication labels using DNA. The platform leverages the inherent stochastic birefringent pattern that emerges through the entropy&#8208;driven instability during the drying process of aqueous DNA solutions. By harnessing the disclinations within the DNA film, secure security codes are generated, exhibiting a level of randomness that ensures robust high&#8208;level security measures.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2302219, Suk Yeop Chun, Young Geun Song, Chong&#8208;Yun Kang, Jung Ho Yoon, and co&#8208;workers propose a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen&#8208;vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, including fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated.

Organic Electrochemical Transistors
In article number 2300308, Natalie Banerji and co&#8208;workers present an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) based on a conjugated polymer film. Switching on the transistor leads to oxidation of the polymer, forming polarons and bipolarons. The charges are compensated by ions that enter the film from the electrolyte. Using time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, they show that polarons prefer the ordered regions of the film, while bipolarons are generated in the amorphous regions.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non&#8208;radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.








Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Single Atom Catalysts for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries: From Dynamic Mechanism to Rational Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms, the rational regulations for various single atom catalysts (SACs) to improve their bifunctional activity and stability, and the challenges and future perspectives of bifunctional SACs for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;air batteries are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Ever&#8208;growing demands for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) call for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Among various electrocatalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to the merits of high atom utilization, structural tunability, and remarkable activity. Rational design of bifunctional SACs relies heavily on an in&#8208;depth understanding of reaction mechanisms, especially dynamic evolution under electrochemical conditions. This requires a systematic study in dynamic mechanisms to replace current trial and error modes. Herein, fundamental understanding of dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms for SACs is first presented combining in situ and/or operando characterizations and theoretical calculations. By highlighting structure&#8211;performance relationships, rational regulation strategies are particularly proposed to facilitate the design of efficient bifunctional SACs. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This review provides a thorough understanding of dynamic mechanisms and regulation strategies for bifunctional SACs, which are expected to pave the avenue for exploring optimum single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts and effective ZABs.

         <title>Dendritic Solid Polymer Electrolytes: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the review, it is not only focused on reviewing dendritic polymer electrolytes (PEs) in basic concept, synthesis methodologies, balancing of properties, ion transport mechanism, etc. but also try to outline the possibility of dendritic PEs toward on&#8208;demand design. It is believed that including examples of designing advanced/safe dendritic PEs will show the readers a more comprehensive prospect of this burgeoning field.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ions battery is widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve energy density. Therefore, Li&#8208;ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as a narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility, and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. In the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Physiological Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks exhibiting significant advantages for developing flexible/stretchable physiological sensors. This review discusses structure, operation, critical features, a wide spectrum of physiological sensing mechanisms and uses, as well as major challenges and opportunities for flexible/stretchable OECTs, particularly for biochemical and bioelectrical sensor applications.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit significant advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the basis of the switching behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V), and high transconductance (in millisiemens range). During the past few years, significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensors has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principles, materials, and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

ToC devices may become state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art models for pharmaceutical oncology trials. To achieve this, the ToC should present reliability in mimicking the TME and monitoring biophysical and chemical signals using sensors and actuators. The translation of this technology to the industrial scale must take into consideration scalability and the standardization of the materials/biomaterials, architectures, actuators, and integration with analytical tools.








Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. 3D tumor&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (ToC) models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment (TME), the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic ToC models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.
