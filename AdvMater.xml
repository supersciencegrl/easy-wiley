         <title>Criteria for Realizing Room&#8208;Temperature Electrical Transport Applications of Topological Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
What does it take to make a room&#8208;temperature electronic device based on the unusual states found in topological materials? The answer is a materials&#8208;redesign, which delicately balances bandgap, dielectric constant, and effective mass. Identifying this new generation of materials can pave the way to realistic quantum technologies.








Abstract
The unusual electronic states found in topological materials can enable a new generation of devices and technologies, yet a long&#8208;standing challenge has been finding materials without deleterious parallel bulk conduction. This can arise either from defects or thermally activated carriers. Here, the criteria that materials need to meet to realize transport properties dominated by the topological states, a necessity for a topological device, are clarified. This is demonstrated for 3D topological insulators, 3D Dirac materials, and 1D quantum anomalous Hall insulators, though this can be applied to similar systems. The key parameters are electronic bandgap, dielectric constant, and carrier effective mass, which dictate under what circumstances (defect density, temperature, etc.) the unwanted bulk state will conduct in parallel to the topological states. As these are fundamentally determined by the basic atomic properties, simple chemical arguments can be used to navigate the phase space to ultimately find improved materials. This will enable rapid identification of new systems with improved properties, which is crucial to designing new material systems and push a new generation of topological technologies.

         <title>Cooperative Catalysis toward Oxygen Reduction Reaction under Dual Coordination Environments on Intrinsic AMnO3&#8208;Type Perovskites via Regulating Stacking Configurations of Coordination Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic superior oxygen reduction reaction activity of SrMnO3 stems from mixed cubic and hexagonal stacking configurations, introducing cooperative catalysis under Mn&#63743;Ocorner and Mn&#63743;Oface coordination environments. The filling of the Ovacancy in the Ocorner site influences the charge distribution in the Oface, which modifies the surface interaction strength with intermediates and triggers active site migration from atop Mn (*OO, *OOH) to Mn&#63743;Mn bridge (*O, *OH).








Abstract
It remains challenging for pure&#8208;phase catalysts to achieve high performance during the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction to overcome the sluggish kinetics without the assistance of extrinsic conditions. Herein, a series of pristine perovskites, i.e., AMnO3 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba), are proposed with various octahedron stacking configurations to demonstrate the cooperative catalysis over SrMnO3 jointly explored by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Comparing with the unitary stacking of coordination units in CaMnO3 or BaMnO3, the intrinsic SrMnO3 with a mixture of corner&#8208;sharing and face&#8208;sharing octahedron stacking configurations demonstrates superior activity (Ehalf&#8208;wave&#160;= 0.81 V), and charge&#8211;discharge stability over 400 h without the voltage gap (&#8776;0.8 V) increasing in zinc&#8211;air batteries. The theoretical study reveals that, on the SrMnO3(110) surface, the active sites switch from coordinatively unsaturated atop Mn (*OO, *OOH) to Mn&#8211;Mn bridge (*O, *OH). Therefore, the intrinsic dual coordination environments of Mn&#8211;Ocorner and Mn&#8211;Oface enable cooperative modulation of the interaction strength of the oxygen intermediates with the surface, inducing the decrease of the *OH desorption energy (rate&#8208;limiting step) unrestricted by scaling relationships with the overpotential of &#8776;0.28 V. This finding provides insights into catalyst design through screening intrinsic structures with multiple coordination unit stacking configurations.

         <title>A Superhydrophobic Droplet&#8208;Based Magnetoelectric Hybrid System to Generate Electricity and Collect Water Simultaneously</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of a miniature, flexible, and superhydrophobic droplet&#8208;based magnetoelectric system (SDMS) capable of generating electricity is demonstrated. Furthermore, the SDMS is incorporated with a cactus&#8208;like superhydrophobic pattern, allowing simultaneous electricity generation and water collection from fog. It is believed that this magnetoelectric strategy can enhance and extend functions in a range of energy&#8208;harvesting fields.








Abstract
Traditional electromagnetic generators used in hydraulic power generation are heavy, bulky, and immovable, and are thus unsuitable for low water supply. A portable miniature electromagnetic system that can harvest energy from rainwater is critical for developing a sustainable energy strategy. In this study, a superhydrophobic droplet&#8208;based magnetoelectric hybrid system is fabricated, that can generate electricity from tiny water droplets. The magnetoelectric system (MS) comprises three parts: a superhydrophobic surface containing a conductive coil, liquid droplets, and a superhydrophobic magnetic powders/Ecoflex base. The mechanical impact of a falling water droplet onto the assembled system is transformed into electricity. Maxwell numerical simulation is used to analyze the related mechanism; the magnetoelectric performance is further improved by modifying the process parameters such as droplet falling velocity and magnetic powder contents. Furthermore, a model is developed, comprising the MS and a cactus&#8208;like superhydrophobic patterned plate that can generate electricity and collect water from fog, simultaneously. The described magnetoelectric strategy is believed to enhance and extend functions in energy harvesting and provide a generalized method to exploit new systems toward sustainable energy development.

         <title>Scalable Substitutional Re&#8208;Doping and its Impact on the Optical and Electronic Properties of Tungsten Diselenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substitutional rhenium (Re) doping of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) films is achieved via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at front&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (FEOL) and back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (BEOL) compatible temperatures, with a doping concentration of &lt;0.001%. Trion concentration is increased as a function of dopant concentration and discrete donor levels that lie close to the conduction band are observed, confirming the n&#8208;type dopant nature of the rhenium atoms.








Abstract
Reliable, controlled doping of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides will enable the realization of next&#8208;generation electronic, logic&#8208;memory, and magnetic devices based on these materials. However, to date, accurate control over dopant concentration and scalability of the process remains a challenge. Here, a systematic study of scalable in situ doping of fully coalesced 2D WSe2 films with Re atoms via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition is reported. Dopant concentrations are uniformly distributed over the substrate surface, with precisely controlled concentrations down to &lt;0.001%&#160;Re achieved by tuning the precursor partial pressure. Moreover, the impact of doping on morphological, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of WSe2 is elucidated with detailed experimental and theoretical examinations, confirming that the substitutional doping of Re at the W site leads to n&#8208;type behavior of WSe2. Transport characteristics of fabricated back&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors are directly correlated to the dopant concentration, with degrading device performances for doping concentrations exceeding 1% of Re. The study demonstrates a viable approach to introducing true dopant&#8208;level impurities with high precision, which can be scaled up to batch production for applications beyond digital electronics.

         <title>3D Printing of a V8C7&#8211;VO2 Bifunctional Scaffold as an Effective Polysulfide Immobilizer and Lithium Stabilizer for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>

A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; 3D&#8208;printing strategy for customizing bifunctional V8C7&#8211;VO2 scaffolds simultaneously realizes effective polysulfide immobilization and lithium stabilization, targeting advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have heretofore attracted tremendous interest due to low cost and high energy density. In this realm, both the severe shuttling of polysulfide and the uncontrollable growth of dendritic lithium have greatly hindered their commercial viability. Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of rational approaches to simultaneously regulate polysulfide behaviors and restrain lithium dendritic growth. Nevertheless, the major obstacles for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries still lie in little knowledge of bifunctional material candidates and inadequate explorations of advanced technologies for customizable devices. Herein, a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy is put forward to elaborate V8C7&#8211;VO2 heterostructure scaffolds via the 3D printing (3DP) technique as dual&#8208;effective polysulfide immobilizer and lithium dendrite inhibitor for Li&#8211;S batteries. A thus&#8208;derived 3DP&#8208;V8C7&#8211;VO2/S electrode demostrates excellent rate capability (643.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6.0 C) and favorable cycling stability (a capacity decay of 0.061% per cycle at 4.0 C after 900 cycles). Importantly, the integrated Li&#8211;S battery harnessing both 3DP hosts realizes high areal capacity under high sulfur loadings (7.36 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 9.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). This work offers insight into solving the concurrent challenges for both S cathode and Li anode throughout 3DP.

         <title>Photonic Fractal Metamaterials: A Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Platform with Enhanced Volatile&#8208;Compound Sensing Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realization of photonic metamaterials is hindered by the lack of multiscale structuring techniques. The stochastically invariant features of fractals are used for engineering a tunable family of active media, consisting of plasmonic nanoresonators in porous semiconductor matrices. This architecture enhances the plasmonic volume over multiple length&#8208;scales, and excellent room&#8208;temperature sensitivity and low detection limits for volatile molecules are demonstrated.








Abstract
Advance of photonics media is restrained by the lack of structuring techniques for the 3D fabrication of active materials with long&#8208;range periodicity. A methodology is reported for the engineering of tunable resonant photonic media with thickness exceeding the plasmonic near&#8208;field enhancement region by more than two orders of magnitude. The media architecture consists of a stochastically ordered distribution of plasmonic nanocrystals in a fractal scaffold of high&#8208;index semiconductors. This plasmonic&#8208;semiconductor fractal media supports the propagation of surface plasmons with drastically enhanced intensity over multiple length scales, overcoming the 2D limitations of established metasurface technologies. The fractal media are used for the fabrication of plasmonic optical gas sensors, achieving a limit of detection of 0.01 vol% at room temperature and sensitivity up to 1.9&#160;nm vol%&#8722;1, demonstrating almost a fivefold increase with respect to an optimized planar geometry. Beneficially to their implementation, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of this fractal architecture allows fabrication of micrometer&#8208;thick media over surfaces of several square centimeters in a few seconds. The designable optical features and intrinsic scalability of these photonic fractal metamaterials provide ample opportunities for applications, bridging across transformation optics, sensing, and light harvesting.

         <title>Periodic Wrinkle&#8208;Patterned Single&#8208;Crystalline Ferroelectric Oxide Membranes with Enhanced Piezoelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding BaTiO3 membranes (ferroelastic oxides) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer (organism) are combined to construct a periodically wrinkled structure. The wrinkle&#8208;patterned ferroelectric membranes offer an ideal platform to explore strain&#8208;correlated fundamental phenomena such as flexoelectricity, strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric domain evolutions, and phase transitions, as well as periodic&#8208;electric&#8208;potential&#8208;induced functions in flexible optical and electrical devices.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled membranes with periodic wrinkled patterns are the critical building blocks of various flexible electronics, where the wrinkles are usually designed and fabricated to provide distinct functionalities. These membranes are typically metallic and organic materials with good ductility that are tolerant of complex deformation. However, the preparation of oxide membranes, especially those with intricate wrinkle patterns, is challenging due to their inherently strong covalent or ionic bonding, which usually leads to material crazing and brittle fracture. Here, wrinkle&#8208;patterned BaTiO3 (BTO)/poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes with finely controlled parallel, zigzag, and mosaic patterns are prepared. The BTO layers show excellent flexibility and can form well&#8208;ordered and periodic wrinkles under compressive in&#8208;plane stress. Enhanced piezoelectricity is observed at the sites of peaks and valleys of the wrinkles where the largest strain gradient is generated. Atomistic simulations further reveal that the excellent elasticity and the correlated coupling between polarization and strain/strain gradient are strongly associated with ferroelectric domain switching and continuous dipole rotation. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is primarily generated at compressive regions, while the in&#8208;plane polarization dominates at the tensile regions. The wrinkled ferroelectric oxides with differently strained regions and correlated polarization distributions would pave a way toward novel flexible electronics.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Metaholographic Displays with Designer Liquid Crystal Modulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based metamaterial devices, which can sense targeted stimuli such as electric&#8208;field, temperature and pressure, and report them optically by displaying corresponding holograms, are demonstrated. The demonstrated systems enable a variety of applications like hologram labels that indicate freshness of temperature&#8208;sensitive products during storage or transport and interactive holographic displays with touch sensing or motion recognition.








Abstract
Flat optics, realized by the artificially created 2D material platform called optical metasurfaces, is currently undergoing a science&#8208;to&#8208;technology transition. However, &#8220;real&#8208;time&#8221; active operations of such flat optical devices remain yet unresolved. Here, liquid crystals (LCs)&#8208;integrated metaholograms for ultracompact dynamic holographic displays are proposed. The anisotropic nature of the LCs allows facile and repeatable manipulation of the polarization of light. Specifically designed (&#8220;designer&#8221;) LCs and efficient helicity&#8208;encoded metaholograms are combined to realize stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic displays. The designer LC modulators are used as switches that enable a variety of external stimuli (e.g., electric field, heat, surface pressure) to operate holographic images in real&#8208;time. Such a dynamic metaholographic platform will provide a path to external stimuli&#8208;driven &#8220;smart&#8221; sensing and display applications such as hologram labels for temperature/pressure/touch monitoring and interactive holographic displays with haptic motion recognition.

         <title>Coherent Electron Transport in Air&#8208;Stable, Printed Single&#8208;Crystal Organic Semiconductor and Application to Megahertz Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>

A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type organic semiconductor, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI, which can be used to form single&#8208;crystalline thin films by printing, is identified as a band&#8208;transport material by means of variable&#8208;temperature gated Hall effect measurements. The printed PhC2&#8722;BQQDI single crystal is also used to demonstrate a high&#8208;frequency transistor with a capability of 4.3&#160;MHz under ambient atmosphere.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have attracted growing attention for optoelectronic applications such as field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), and coherent (or band&#8208;like) carrier transport properties in OSC single crystals (SCs) have been of interest as they can lead to high carrier mobilities. Recently, such p&#8208;type OSC SCs compatible with a printing technology have been used to achieve high&#8208;speed FETs; therefore, developments of n&#8208;type counterparts may be promising for realizing high&#8208;speed complementary organic circuits. Herein, coherent electron transport properties in a printed SC of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type OSC, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI, by means of variable&#8208;temperature gated Hall effect measurements and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction analyses in conjunction with band structure calculations, are reported. Furthermore, the SC FET is tested for high&#8208;speed operations, which obtains a cutoff frequency of 4.3&#160;MHz at an operation voltage of 20&#160;V in air. Thus, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI is shown as a new candidate for practical applications of SC&#8208;based, organic complementary devices.

         <title>Controllable Magnetic Proximity Effect and Charge Transfer in 2D Semiconductor and Double&#8208;Layered Perovskite Manganese Oxide van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel van der Waals heterostructure consisting of monolayer MoSe2, Mn oxide, and a buffer layer (h&#8208;BN) demonstrates magnetic proximity and charge transfer effect for the excitonic states due to phase transition of Mn oxide from ferromagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator. The controllable thickness of h&#8208;BN reveals a characteristic length scale of several nanometers in magnetic proximity and charge transfer.








Abstract
Optically generated excitonic states (excitons and trions) in transition metal dichalcogenides are highly sensitive to the electronic and magnetic properties of the materials underneath. Modulation and control of the excitonic states in a novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of monolayer MoSe2 on double&#8208;layered perovskite Mn oxide ((La0.8Nd0.2)1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7) is demonstrated, wherein the Mn oxide transforms from a paramagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic metal. A discontinuous change in the exciton photoluminescence intensity via dielectric screening is observed. Further, a relatively high trion intensity is discovered due to the charge transfer from metallic Mn oxide under the Curie temperature. Moreover, the vdW heterostructures with an ultrathin h&#8208;BN spacer layer demonstrate enhanced valley splitting and polarization of excitonic states due to the proximity effect of the ferromagnetic spins of Mn oxide. The controllable h&#8208;BN thickness in vdW heterostructures reveals a several&#8208;nanometer&#8208;long scale of charge transfer as well as a magnetic proximity effect. The vdW heterostructure allows modulation and control of the excitonic states via dielectric screening, charge carriers, and magnetic spins.

         <title>Tissue&#8208;Adaptive Materials with Independently Regulated Modulus and Transition Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush elastomers with crystallizable side chains undergo dramatic softening transition upon heating. At body temperature, &#8776;37 &#176;C,&#160;these materials drop their modulus by up to six orders of magnitude, transitioning from hard plastic to tissue&#8208;like elastomer with transition temperature and modulus controlled by the brush architecture. Simultaneously, materials softening triggers drug release, thus highlighting their potential as tissue&#8208;adaptive implants.








Abstract
The ability of living species to transition between rigid and flexible shapes represents one of their survival mechanisms, which has been adopted by various human technologies. Such transition is especially desired in medical devices as rigidity facilitates the implantation process, while flexibility and softness favor biocompatibility with surrounding tissue. Traditional thermoplastics cannot match soft tissue mechanics, while gels leach into the body and alter their properties over time. Here, a single&#8208;component system with an unprecedented drop of Young's modulus by up to six orders of magnitude from the GPa to kPa level at a controlled temperature within 28&#8211;43&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated. This approach is based on brush&#8208;like polymer networks with crystallizable side chains, e.g., poly(valerolactone), affording independent control of melting temperature and Young's modulus by concurrently altering side chain length and crosslink density. Softening down to the tissue level at the physiological temperature allows the design of tissue&#8208;adaptive implants that can be inserted as rigid devices followed by matching the surrounding tissue mechanics at body temperature. This transition also enables thermally triggered release of embedded drugs for anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Insulator Transition and Orbital Polarization in Nickelate Superlattices Integrated on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering is well demonstrated for perovskite oxides, mostly by growing epitaxial films onto an isostructural oxide substrate having a different lattice constant. The joint effects of epitaxial and thermal strain on the metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition and orbital configuration are revealed for nickelate superlattices grown on silicon substrates, illustrating the feasibility of extending strain engineering to the technologically important silicon platform.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth of SrTiO3 (STO) on silicon greatly accelerates the monolithic integration of multifunctional oxides into the mainstream semiconductor electronics. However, oxide superlattices (SLs), the birthplace of many exciting discoveries, remain largely unexplored on silicon. In this work, LaNiO3/LaFeO3 SLs are synthesized on STO&#8208;buffered silicon (Si/STO) and STO single&#8208;crystal substrates, and their electronic properties are compared using dc transport and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Both sets of SLs show a similar thickness&#8208;driven metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, albeit with resistivity and transition temperature modified by the different amounts of strain. In particular, the large tensile strain promotes a pronounced Ni 3dx2&#8722;y2 orbital polarization for the SL grown on Si/STO, comparable to that reported for LaNiO3 SL epitaxially strained to DyScO3 substrate. Those results illustrate the ability to integrate oxide SLs on silicon with structure and property approaching their counterparts grown on STO single crystal, and also open up new prospects of strain engineering in functional oxides based on the Si platform.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of 2D Janus Crystals and their Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus crystals represent an exciting class of 2D materials with different atomic species on their upper and lower facets. Theories predict that this broken symmetry leads to a wealth of novel properties. A room&#8208;temperature technique for the synthesis of a variety of Janus monolayers and their lateral and vertical heterostructures with high structural and optical quality is reported.








Abstract
Janus crystals represent an exciting class of 2D materials with different atomic species on their upper and lower facets. Theories have predicted that this symmetry breaking induces an electric field and leads to a wealth of novel properties, such as large Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling and formation of strongly correlated electronic states. Monolayer MoSSe Janus crystals have been synthesized by two methods, via controlled sulfurization of monolayer MoSe2 and via plasma stripping followed thermal annealing of MoS2. However, the high processing temperatures prevent growth of other Janus materials and their heterostructures. Here, a room&#8208;temperature technique for the synthesis of a variety of Janus monolayers with high structural and optical quality is reported. This process involves low&#8208;energy reactive radical precursors, which enables selective removal and replacement of the uppermost chalcogen layer, thus transforming classical transition metal dichalcogenides into a Janus structure. The resulting materials show clear mixed character for their excitonic transitions, and more importantly, the presented room&#8208;temperature method enables the demonstration of first vertical and lateral heterojunctions of 2D Janus TMDs. The results present significant and pioneering advances in the synthesis of new classes of 2D materials, and pave the way for the creation of heterostructures from 2D Janus layers.

Here, a room&#8208;temperature technique for the synthesis of a variety of Janus monolayers with high structural and optical quality is reported. This process involves low&#8208;energy reactive radical precursors, which enables selective removal and replacement of the uppermost chalcogen layer, thus transforming classical transition metal dichalcogenides into a Janus structure. The resulting materials show clear mixed character for their excitonic transitions, and more importantly, the presented room&#8208;temperature method enables the demonstration of first vertical and lateral heterojunctions of 2D Janus TMDs. The results present significant and pioneering advances in the synthesis of new classes of 2D materials, and pave the way for the creation of heterostructures from 2D Janus layers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhancing the Performance of Organic Solar Cells by Prolonging the Lifetime of Photogenerated Excitons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
9&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (FCA) is utilized to prolong the lifetime of photogenerated excitons in a nonfullerene acceptor (IT&#8208;M) approximately twofold, ensuring longer exciton diffusion length and efficiency enhancement in organic photovoltaic devices. The prolongation arises from the discovered intermolecular vibrational coupling between the electronic excited state of IT&#8208;M and the electronic ground state of FCA, thus suppressing the nonradiative decay.








Abstract
Exciton lifetime (&#964;) is crucial for the migration of excitons to donor/acceptor interfaces for subsequent charge separation in organic solar cells (OSCs); however, obvious prolongation of &#964; has rarely been achieved. Here, by introducing a solid additive 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (FCA) into the active layer, which comprises a nonfullerene acceptor, 3,9&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylene&#8208;((3&#8208;(1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene)&#8208;6/7&#8208;methyl)&#8208;indanone))&#8208;5,5,11,11&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;hexylphenyl)&#8208;dithieno[2,3&#8208;d:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d&#8242;]&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (IT&#8208;M), &#964; is substantially prolonged from 491 to 928 ps, together with obvious increases in fluorescence intensity and quantum yield. Time&#8208;resolved transient infrared spectra indicate the presence of an intermolecular vibrational coupling between the electronic excited state of IT&#8208;M and the electronic ground state of FCA, which is first observed here and which can suppress the internal conversion process. IT&#8208;M&#8208;based OSCs display an improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor after the addition of FCA. Thus, the power conversion efficiency is increased, particularly for devices with a large donor/acceptor ratio of 1:4, whose efficiency is increased by 56%. This study describes a novel method, which is also applicable to other nonfullerene acceptors, for further improving the performance of OSCs without affecting their morphology and light absorption properties.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Mode, Self&#8208;Adapting, and Self&#8208;Powered Mechanoreceptor Based on a Potentiometric&#8211;Triboelectric Hybridized Sensing Mechanism for Resolving Complex Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new potentiometric&#8211;triboelectric hybridized mechanotransduction mechanism is proposed to create single&#8208;mode, self&#8208;adapting, and self&#8208;powered artificial mechanoreceptors. Such mechanoreceptors enable complex mechanical stimuli to be resolved with greatly simplified fabrication/operation and enhanced functionality/energy&#8208;efficiency. The promising applications of the mechanoreceptors in monitoring object manipulation and detecting complex stimuli in diverse practical scenarios of daily life is explored.








Abstract
Human skin is equipped with slow adapting (SA) and fast adapting (FA) capabilities simultaneously. To mimic such functionalities, elaborately designed devices have been explored by integrating multiple sensing elements or adopting multimode sensing principles. However, the complicated fabrication, signal mismatch of different modules, complex operation, and high power&#8208;consumption hinder their widespread applications. Here, a new type of single&#8208;mode and self&#8208;powered mechanoreceptor that can mimic both SA and FA via seamless fusion of complementary while compatible potentiometric and triboelectric sensing principles is reported. The resultant potentiometric&#8211;triboelectric hybridized mechanoreceptor exhibits distinctive features that are hard to achieve via currently existing methods, including single&#8208;mode output (only voltage signal), greatly simplified operation (single&#8208;measurement setup), ultralow power&#8208;consumption (&lt;1 nW), self&#8208;adaptive response behavior, and good capability for resolving complex stimuli. Diverse mechanical characteristics, including magnitude, duration, frequency, applying and releasing speed, can be well interpreted with this single&#8208;mode and self&#8208;powered mechanoreceptor. Its promising application for monitoring object manipulations with a soft robotic gripper is explored. Furthermore, the versatility of the mechanoreceptor for resolving complex stimuli in diverse daily scenarios is demonstrated. This work presents a new design that will significantly simplify the fabrication/operation and meanwhile boost the functionality/energy&#8208;efficiency of future electronic devices and smart systems.

There is an increasing interest to develop the next generation of touch pads, requiring stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;healing, to allow integration with the human body.

Abstract
There is an increasing interest to develop a next generation of touch pads that require stretchability and biocompatibility to allow their integration with a human body, and even to mimic the self&#8208;healing behavior with fast functionality recovery upon damage. However, most touch pads are developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes with the lack of the important nature of self&#8208;healing. Polyzwitterion&#8211;clay nanocomposite hydrogels as a soft, stretchable, and transparent ionic conductor with transmittance of 98.8% and fracture strain beyond 1500% are developed, which can be used as a self&#8208;healing human&#8211;machine interactive touch pad with pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesiveness on target substrates. A surface&#8208;capacitive touch system is adopted to sense a touched position. Finger positions are perceived during both point&#8208;by&#8208;point touch and continuous moving. Hydrogel touch pads are adhered to curved or flat insulators, with the high&#8208;resolution and self&#8208;healable input functions demonstrated by drawing, writing, and playing electronic games.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Like Ultrahigh Free&#8208;Carrier Concentration in Metal&#8208;Oxide Material for Giant and Tunable Plasmon Resonance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The giant and tunable plasmonic material of HxMoO3 holds a high free&#8208;carrier concentration up to 1021 cm&#8722;3, approaching that of metals. The unique quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure provides a long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra with an enhancement factor of 1.1 &#215; 107 and a detection limit of 1 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mol L&#8722;1 are achieved, representing the best among the hitherto reported metal oxides.








Abstract
The practical utilization of plasmon&#8208;based technology relies on the ability to find high&#8208;performance plasmonic materials other than noble metals. A key scientific challenge is to significantly increase the intrinsically low concentration of free carriers in metal&#8208;oxide materials. Here, a novel electron&#8211;proton co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to achieve uniform hydrogen doping in metal&#8208;oxide MoO3 at mild conditions, which creates a metal&#8208;like ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration approaching that of noble metals (1021 cm&#8722;3 in H1.68MoO3 versus 1022 cm&#8722;3 in Au/Ag). This bestows giant and tunable plasmonic resonances in the visible region to this originally semiconductive material. Using ultrafast spectroscopy characterizations and first&#8208;principle simulations, the formation of a quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure that leads to long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field is revealed. As verified by the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of rhodamine 6G molecules on HxMoO3, the SERS enhancement factor reaches as high as 1.1 &#215; 107 with a detection limit at concentration as low as 1 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mol L&#8722;1, representing the best among the hitherto reported non&#8208;metal systems. The findings not only provide a set of metal&#8208;like semiconductor materials with merits of low cost, tunable electronic structure, and plasmonic resonance, but also a general strategy to induce tunable ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration in non&#8208;metal systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical utilization of plasmon&#8208;based technology relies on the ability to find high&#8208;performance plasmonic materials other than noble metals. A key scientific challenge is to significantly increase the intrinsically low concentration of free carriers in metal&#8208;oxide materials. Here, a novel electron&#8211;proton co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to achieve uniform hydrogen doping in metal&#8208;oxide MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at mild conditions, which creates a metal&#8208;like ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration approaching that of noble metals (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; in H&lt;sub&gt;1.68&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; versus 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Au/Ag). This bestows giant and tunable plasmonic resonances in the visible region to this originally semiconductive material. Using ultrafast spectroscopy characterizations and first&#8208;principle simulations, the formation of a quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure that leads to long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field is revealed. As verified by the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of rhodamine 6G molecules on H&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the SERS enhancement factor reaches as high as 1.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; with a detection limit at concentration as low as 1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the best among the hitherto reported non&#8208;metal systems. The findings not only provide a set of metal&#8208;like semiconductor materials with merits of low cost, tunable electronic structure, and plasmonic resonance, but also a general strategy to induce tunable ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration in non&#8208;metal systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Surface Se&#8208;Substituted LiCo[O2&#8722;&#948;Se&#948;] Cathode with Ultrastable High&#8208;Voltage Cycling in Pouch Full&#8208;Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>

Selenium has an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect when charging commercial LiCoO2 to high voltages, by substituting part of the mobile oxidized oxygen ions (O&#945;&#8208;) in the charged lattice to eliminate oxygen vacancies, transplant the pumped charges from O&#945;&#8208;, and reduce the mobile O&#945;&#8208; ions back to immobile O2&#8208; ions, to stop further oxygen migration and stabilize the high&#8208;voltage cycling.








Abstract
Cycling LiCoO2 to above 4.5&#160;V for higher capacity is enticing; however, hybrid O anion&#8208; and Co cation&#8208;redox (HACR) at high voltages facilitates intrinsic O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&#160;&lt; 2) migration, causing oxygen loss, phase collapse, and electrolyte decomposition that severely degrade the battery cyclability. Hereby, commercial LiCoO2 particles are operando treated with selenium, a well&#8208;known anti&#8208;aging element to capture oxygen&#8208;radicals in the human body, showing an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect in high&#8208;voltage battery cycling and successfully stopping the escape of oxygen from LiCoO2 even when the cathode is cycled to 4.62 V. Ab initio calculation and soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis suggest that during deep charging, the precoated Se will initially substitute some mobile O&#945;&#8722; at the charged LiCoO2 surface, transplanting the pumped charges from O&#945;&#8722; and reducing it back to O2&#8722; to stabilize the oxygen lattice in prolonged cycling. As a result, the material retains 80% and 77% of its capacity after 450 and 550 cycles under 100 mA g&#8722;1 in 4.57&#160;V pouch full&#8208;cells matched with a graphite anode and an ultralean electrolyte (2&#160;g Ah&#8722;1).

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Mechanically Tough Polyurethane Elastomers with Exceptional Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Healable, recyclable, and mechanically tough elastomers with exceptional fracture energy of &#8776;192.9&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 are fabricated by crosslinking polyurethanes with in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed dynamic hierarchical domains capable of deformation and disintegration under external force. Elastomers can be healed and recycled in a highly efficient way to restore their original mechanical properties.








Abstract
There is a huge requirement of elastomers for use in tires, seals, and shock absorbers every year worldwide. In view of a sustainable society, the next generation of elastomers is expected to combine outstanding healing, recycling, and damage&#8208;tolerant capacities with high strength, elasticity, and toughness. However, it remains challenging to fabricate such elastomers because the mechanisms for the properties mentioned above are mutually exclusive. Herein, the fabrication of healable, recyclable, and mechanically tough polyurethane (PU) elastomers with outstanding damage tolerance by coordination of multiblock polymers of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/polycaprolactone (PCL) containing hydrogen and coordination bonding motifs with Zn2+ ions is reported. The organization of bipyridine groups coordinated with Zn2+ ions, carbamate groups cross&#8208;linked with hydrogen bonds, and crystallized PCL segments generates phase&#8208;separated dynamic hierarchical domains. Serving as rigid nanofillers capable of deformation and disintegration under an external force, the dynamic hierarchical domains can strengthen the elastomers and significantly enhance their toughness and fracture energy. As a result, the elastomers exhibit a tensile strength of &#8776;52.4&#160;MPa, a toughness of &#8776;363.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and an exceptional fracture energy of &#8776;192.9&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2. Furthermore, the elastomers can be conveniently healed and recycled to regain their original mechanical properties and integrity under heating.

         <title>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD Neutralizing Antibody Induction is Enhanced by Particulate Vaccination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is a target for COVID&#8208;19 vaccine development. Using a next&#8208;generation vaccine adjuvant system that rapidly converts soluble antigens into stable particles, the neutralizing antibody response induced by the RBD is greatly enhanced, demonstrating merit for particle&#8208;based approaches toward RBD&#8208;based vaccines.








Abstract
The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein is a candidate vaccine antigen that binds angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2&#160;(ACE2), leading to virus entry. Here, it is shown that rapid conversion of recombinant RBD into particulate form via admixing with liposomes containing cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;phospholipid (CoPoP) potently enhances the functional antibody response. Antigen binding via His&#8208;tag insertion into the CoPoP bilayer results in a serum&#8208;stable and conformationally intact display of the RBD on the liposome surface. Compared to other vaccine formulations, immunization using CoPoP liposomes admixed with recombinant RBD induces multiple orders of magnitude higher levels of antibody titers in mice that neutralize pseudovirus cell entry, block RBD interaction with ACE2, and inhibit live virus replication. Enhanced immunogenicity can be accounted for by greater RBD uptake into antigen&#8208;presenting cells in particulate form and improved immune cell infiltration in draining lymph nodes. QS&#8208;21 inclusion in the liposomes results in an enhanced antigen&#8208;specific polyfunctional T cell response. In mice, high dose immunization results in minimal local reactogenicity, is well&#8208;tolerated, and does not elevate serum cobalt levels. Taken together, these results confirm that particulate presentation strategies for the RBD immunogen should be considered for inducing strongly neutralizing antibody responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Biomimetic Diselenide&#8208;Bridged Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles as an X&#8208;ray&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Carrier for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles are tailored for radiation&#8208;responsive delivery of doxorubicin to solid tumors and are combined with a PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade as a chemo&#8208;immunotherapy strategy. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiation, these cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanotherapeutics exhibit degradation&#8208;controlled drug release and induce anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, leading to enhanced tumor regression and metastasis inhibition with low systemic toxicity when combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1.

Chemotherapy causes off&#8208;target toxicity and is often ineffective against solid tumors. Targeted and on&#8208;demand release of chemotherapeutics remains a challenge. Here, cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) containing X&#8208;ray&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive diselenide bonds for controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX) at tumor sites are developed. DOX&#8208;loaded MONs coated with 4T1 breast cancer cell membranes (CM@MON@DOX) show greater accumulation at tumor sites and prolonged blood circulation time versus an uncoated control in mice bearing 4T1 orthotopic mammary tumors. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiation, the DOX&#8208;loaded MONs exhibit carrier degradation&#8208;controlled release via cleavage of diselenide bonds, resulting in DOX&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death at the tumor site. Combination with a PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade further enhances inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis with low systemic toxicity. Together, the findings show the promise of these biomimetic, radiation&#8208;responsive diselenide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs in chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Biomimetic mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles are tailored for radiation&#8208;responsive delivery of doxorubicin to solid tumors and are combined with a PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade as a chemo&#8208;immunotherapy strategy.

         <title>Kinetically Stable Oxide Overlayers on Mo3P Nanoparticles Enabling Lithium&#8211;Air Batteries with Low Overpotentials and Long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo3P nanoparticles with a kinetically stable oxide overlayer exhibit remarkable ORR/OER activities near thermodynamic potentials in non&#8208;aqueous media. Using this catalyst alongside TEMPO and DBBQ redox mediators in a lithium&#8211;air battery favors the solution&#8208;based mechanism for epitaxial growth of Li2O2 at the lowest overpotentials, the effects of which are addressed through directed experimental efforts in electrochemical characterization coupled with a computational approach.








Abstract
The main drawbacks of today's state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;air) batteries are their low energy efficiency and limited cycle life due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant cathode catalysts that can drive both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) at high rates at thermodynamic potentials. Here, inexpensive trimolybdenum phosphide (Mo3P) nanoparticles with an exceptional activity&#8212;ORR and OER current densities of 7.21 and 6.85 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.0 and 4.2 V versus Li/Li+, respectively&#8212;in an oxygen&#8208;saturated non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte are reported. The Tafel plots indicate remarkably low charge transfer resistance&#8212;Tafel slopes of 35 and 38 mV dec&#8722;1 for ORR and OER, respectively&#8212;resulting in the lowest ORR overpotential of 4.0 mV and OER overpotential of 5.1 mV reported to date. Using this catalyst, a Li&#8211;air battery cell with low discharge and charge overpotentials of 80 and 270 mV, respectively, and high energy efficiency of 90.2% in the first cycle is demonstrated. A long cycle life of 1200 is also achieved for this cell. Density functional theory calculations of ORR and OER on Mo3P (110) reveal that an oxide overlayer formed on the surface gives rise to the observed high ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity and small discharge/charge overpotentials.

         <title>Polymeric Membranes with Selective Solution&#8208;Diffusion for Intercepting Volatile Organic Compounds during Solar&#8208;Driven Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micropyramid&#8208;structured PPy membrane with selective solution&#8208;diffusion effect is employed as the photothermal material for solar water purification. The membrane is successful in intercepting the evaporation of volatile organic molecules in wastewater. Furthermore, its high light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency and good mechanical strength make the membrane a promising photothermal material for practical solar water purification.








Abstract
Solar evaporation through a photothermal porous material provides a feasible and sustainable method for water remediation. Several photothermal materials have been developed to enhance solar evaporation efficiency. However, a critical limitation of current photothermal materials is their inability to separate water from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in wastewater. Here, a microstructured ultrathin polymeric membrane that enables freshwater separation from VOC pollutants by solar evaporation with a VOC removal rate of 90%, is reported. The different solution&#8208;diffusion behaviors of water and VOCs with polymeric membranes facilitate their separation. Moreover, owing to increased light absorption, enlarged liquid&#8211;air interface, and shortened mass transfer distance, the microstructured and ultrathin configuration of the membrane helps to balance the tradeoff between permeation selectivity and water production capacity. The membrane is not only effective for evaporation of simulated volatile pollutants in a prototype, but can also intercept complex volatile organic contaminants in natural water sources and produce water that meets drinking&#8208;water standards. With practical demonstration and satisfactory purification performance, this work paves the way for practical application of solar evaporation for effective water remediation.

         <title>Vaccines: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD Neutralizing Antibody Induction is Enhanced by Particulate Vaccination (Adv. Mater. 50/2020)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2005637, Jonathan F. Lovell and co&#8208;workers show that the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD surface protein becomes a potent immunogen when presented in nanoparticle format. Using a vaccine adjuvant that spontaneously converts soluble recombinant antigens into stable particles, immunization studies in mice and rabbits shows that the particle&#8208;based RBD elicits strong immune responses and potent antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus.

In article number 2002471, Antonio Tricoli and co&#8208;workers use the scale&#8208;invariant features of fractals obtained by Brownian motion for the realization of a tunable family of photonic metamaterials consisting of a 3D distribution of plasmonic and semiconductor nanoparticles. The short&#8208; and long&#8208;range periodicity of these fractal metamaterials enables advanced light&#8211;matter&#8211;fluid interaction and, when used for optical sensing of volatile molecules, they demonstrate an outstanding room&#8208;temperature sensitivity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004477, Ziyao Zhou, Xiangdong Ding, Tai Min, Ming Liu, and  co&#8208;workers present a periodically wrinkled structure that combines flexible ferroelectric membranes and organic elastomers. Enhanced piezoelectricity is observed at the sites  of the peaks and valleys of the wrinkles where the largest strain gradient is generated. The wrinkle&#8208;patterned ferroelectric membranes offer an ideal platform to explore the  periodic&#8208;electric&#8208;potential&#8208;induced functions in flexible electrical and optical devices.

A touch&#8208;responsive meta&#8208;holographic display, which is promising for interactive holographic displays with touch sensing or motion recognition is presented by Young&#8208;Ki Kim, Junsuk Rho, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2004664. According to an applied surface pressure with a gentle finger touch, the floating holographic images encoded in a metasurface can be switched in real&#8208;time. The liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;integrated  metasurface devices can be further functionalized to sense programmed stimuli such as electric fields and temperature.

Optically excited states in semiconductors are highly sensitive to the physical properties of the materials underneath. In article number 2003501, Kazunari Matsuda and co&#8208;workers demonstrate modulation and control of the excitonic states (excitons and trions) in a novel van der Waals heterostructure of a monolayer semiconductor on the strongly correlated electron system of perovskite manganese oxide with a thin insulating layer, wherein manganese oxide transforms from a paramagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic metal.

         <title>Topological Materials: Criteria for Realizing Room&#8208;Temperature Electrical Transport Applications of Topological Materials (Adv. Mater. 50/2020)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual properties exhibited by topological materials, such as 1D edge states that are spin&#8208;polarized, can enable routes to faster data processing with lower energy consumption. To realize such technologies, however, it is required that unwanted parallel bulk conduction through the trivial 2D/3D states is eliminated. In article number 2005698, Matthew Brahlek shows that redesigning materials at the atomic level to delicately balance bandgap, dielectric constant, and effective mass is critical to achieve this new generation of quantum&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Engineering Aptamer Switches for Multifunctional Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Nanosystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of nucleic acid materials that can perform &#8220;switching&#8221; processes and achieve complex functions such as signaling or controlled payload release in response to external stimuli including light, pH, ligand&#8208;binding, and other microenvironmental cues is presented. The underlying mechanisms that enable such stimulus&#8208;driven responses, and strategies for engineering those functionalities into nanomaterials are described.








Abstract
Although RNA and DNA are best known for their capacity to encode biological information, it has become increasingly clear over the past few decades that these biomolecules are also capable of performing other complex functions, such as molecular recognition (e.g., aptamers) and catalysis (e.g., ribozymes). Building on these foundations, researchers have begun to exploit the predictable base&#8208;pairing properties of RNA and DNA in order to utilize nucleic acids as functional materials that can undergo a molecular &#8220;switching&#8221; process, performing complex functions such as signaling or controlled payload release in response to external stimuli including light, pH, ligand&#8208;binding and other microenvironmental cues. Although this field is still in its infancy, these efforts offer exciting potential for the development of biologically based &#8220;smart materials&#8221;. Herein, ongoing progress in the use of nucleic acids as an externally controllable switching material is reviewed. The diverse range of mechanisms that can trigger a stimulus response, and strategies for engineering those functionalities into nucleic acid materials are explored. Finally, recent progress is discussed in incorporating aptamer switches into more complex synthetic nucleic acid&#8208;based nanostructures and functionalized smart materials.

         <title>Choose Your Own Adventure: Fabrication of Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication challenges of monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem photovoltaics are detailed in a step&#8208;by&#8208;step, choose&#8208;your&#8208;own&#8208;adventure fashion. The trade&#8208;offs between sub&#8208;cell efficiency and processing stability are highlighted and pros and cons are weighed. Through this detailed analysis, a few routes to reach &gt;30%&#160;power conversion efficiency and the necessary work are identified.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have transfixed the photovoltaic (PV) community due to their outstanding and tunable optoelectronic properties coupled to demonstrations of high&#8208;power conversion efficiencies (PCE) at a range of bandgaps. This has motivated the field to push perovskites to reach the highest possible performance. One way to increase the efficiency is by fabricating multijunction solar cells, which can split the solar spectrum, reducing thermalization loss. Low&#8208;cost all&#8208;perovskite tandems have a real chance to soon exceed 30% PCE, which could transform the PV industry. Achieving this goal requires the identification of perovskite sub&#8208;cells that are both highly efficient and can be effectively integrated. Herein, it is discussed how to navigate the multiple&#8208;choice adventure in choosing between the myriad of options and considerations present when deciding what perovskite materials, contact layers, and processing tools to use. Some of the potential fabrication pitfalls often encountered in MHP based tandem PVs are highlighted, so that they can hopefully be avoided in the future.

         <title>Preintercalation Strategy in Manganese Oxides for Electrochemical Energy Storage: Review and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 50, December 17, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic advantages and mechanisms of the preintercalation strategy in enhancing intrinsic conductivity, activating more active sites, promoting diffusion kinetics, and stabilizing structural integrity of MnO2 cathode materials are reviewed. Simultaneously, the current challenges for the preintercalation strategy for future research and development regarding the design of high&#8208;performance MnO2 cathodes for the next&#8208;generation batteries are discussed.








Abstract
Manganese oxides (MnO2) are promising cathode materials for various kinds of battery applications, including Li&#8208;ion, Na&#8208;ion, Mg&#8208;ion, and Zn&#8208;ion batteries, etc., due to their low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity. However, the practical application of MnO2 cathodes has been restricted by some critical issues including low electronic conductivity, low utilization of discharge depth, sluggish diffusion kinetics, and structural instability upon cycling. Preintercalation of ions/molecules into the crystal structure with/without structural reconstruction provides essential optimizations to alleviate these issues. Here, the intrinsic advantages and mechanisms of the preintercalation strategy in enhancing electronic conductivity, activating more active sites, promoting diffusion kinetics, and stabilizing the structural integrity of MnO2 cathode materials are summarized. The current challenges related to the preintercalation strategy, along with prospects for the future research and development regarding its implementation in the design of high&#8208;performance MnO2 cathodes for the next&#8208;generation batteries are also discussed.

         <title>Colors of Single&#8208;Wall Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colors of 466 species of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are revealed by experiments on clean dry thin films and modeling of the carbon nanotube absorbance spectra. A quantitative coloration model of SWCNTs is proposed and is verified by existing experimental data. This model predicts the existence of brilliantly colored carbon nanotube films that can display the full rainbow.








Abstract
Although single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit various colors in suspension, directly synthesized SWCNT films usually appear black. Recently, a unique one&#8208;step method for directly fabricating green and brown films has been developed. Such remarkable progress, however, has brought up several new questions. The coloration mechanism, potentially achievable colors, and color controllability of SWCNTs are unknown. Here, a quantitative model is reported that can predict the specific colors of SWCNT films and unambiguously identify the coloration mechanism. Using this model, colors of 466 different SWCNT species are calculated, which reveals a broad spectrum of potentially achievable colors of SWCNTs. The calculated colors are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Furthermore, the theory predicts the existence of many brilliantly colored SWCNT films, which are experimentally expected. This study shows that SWCNTs as a form of pure carbon, can display a full spectrum of vivid colors, which is expected to complement the general understanding of carbon materials.

         <title>Recent Progress in Solution&#8208;Based Metal Oxide Resistive Switching Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;based metal oxide thin films allow the achievement of ultra&#8208;low power and high&#8208;density resistive switching devices by using low&#8208;cost and simple processes being compatible with large area manufacturing required by internet of things. To enhance the performance of solution&#8208;based resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM) some challenges such as stability and reproducibility can be surpassed by controlling the metal oxide synthesis parameters.








Abstract
Metal oxide resistive switching memories have been a crucial component for the requirements of the Internet of Things, which demands ultra&#8208;low power and high&#8208;density devices with new computing principles, exploiting low cost green products and technologies. Most of the reported resistive switching devices use conventional methods (physical and chemical vapor deposition), which are quite expensive due to their up&#8208;scale production. Solution&#8208;processing methods have been improved, being now a reliable technology that offers many advantages for resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) such as high versatility, large area uniformity, transparency, low&#8208;cost and a simple fabrication of two&#8208;terminal structures. Solution&#8208;based metal oxide RRAM devices are emergent and promising non&#8208;volatile memories for future electronics. In this review, a brief history of non&#8208;volatile memories is highlighted as well as the present status of solution&#8208;based metal oxide resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM). Then, a focus on describing the solution synthesis parameters of S&#8208;RRAMs which induce a massive influence in the overall performance of these devices is discussed. Next, a precise analysis is performed on the metal oxide thin film and electrode interface and the recent advances on S&#8208;RRAM that will allow their large&#8208;area manufacturing. Finally, the figures of merit and the main challenges in S&#8208;RRAMs are discussed and future trends are proposed.

         <title>Ultrasoft and High&#8208;Mobility Block Copolymers for Skin&#8208;Compatible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triblock copolymers (TBCs) comprising a high&#8208;performance polymer semiconductor endcapped with soft elastomeric chains can phase segregate on the nanoscale, while preserving the properties of the individual blocks. The TBCs are ultrasoft (5 MPa), electronically functional (0.1 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), stretchable and durable, and maintain conductivity after 1500 cycles to 50% strain in a doped state.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors (PSCs) are an essential component of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), but their potential for stretchable electronics is limited by their brittleness and failure susceptibility upon strain. Herein, a covalent connection of two state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymers&#8212;semiconducting poly&#8208;diketo&#8208;pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;thienothiophene (PDPP&#8208;TT) and elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)&#8212;in a single triblock copolymer (TBC) chain is reported, which enables high charge carrier mobility and low modulus in one system. Three TBCs containing up to 65 wt% PDMS were obtained, and the TBC with 65 wt% PDMS content exhibits mobilities up to 0.1 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, in the range of the fully conjugated reference polymer PDPP&#8208;TT (0.7 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). The TBC is ultrasoft with a low elastic modulus (5 MPa) in the range of mammalian tissue. The TBC exhibits an excellent stretchability and extraordinary durability, fully maintaining the initial electric conductivity in a doped state after 1500 cycles to 50% strain.

         <title>Selective Ethanol Oxidation Reaction at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface can be used as a highly active and selective site for ethanol oxidation to form CO2, where the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly facilitates both electron transfer from the Rh to the Sn species and oxidation of the poisonous intermediates, leading to improved selectivity to the C1 pathway and excellent durability for the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are regarded as an attractive power source with high energy density, bio&#8208;renewability, and convenient storage and transportation. However, the anodic reaction of DEFCs, that is, the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), suffers from poor efficiency due to the low selectivity to CO2 (C1 pathway) and high selectivity to CH3COOH (C2 pathway). In this study, the selective EOR to CO2 can be achieved at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface in SnO2&#8211;Rh nanosheets (NSs). The optimized catalyst of 0.2SnO2&#8211;Rh NSs/C exhibits excellent alkaline EOR performance with a mass activity of 213.2 mA mgRh&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of 72.8% for the C1 pathway, which are 1.7 and 1.9 times higher than those of Rh NSs/C. Mechanism studies indicate that the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly promotes the breaking of C&#63743;C bond of C2H5OH to form CO2, and facilitates oxidation of the poisonous intermediates (*CO and *CH3) to suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. This work not only provides a highly selective, active, and stable catalyst for the EOR, but also promotes fundamental research for the design of efficient catalysts via interface modification.

         <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium/Carbon Nanotube Hybrid for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dendrite&#8208;free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid has been fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs for Li&#8208;metal batteries. Favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are a powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network. The obtained hybrid exhibits super&#8208;stable function even at an ultrahigh current density.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is promising in the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, its practical application is still hindered by the poor cycling performance and serious safety issues for the consequence of dendritic Li. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid is proposed, which is fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs, for Li&#8208;metal batteries. The favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are the powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network, which is the key to form a uniform metallic layer in Li/CNTs hybrid. The obtained hybrid indicates super&#8208;stable functions even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2000 cycles with a stripping/plating capacity of 2 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Subsequently, this hybrid also demonstrates a significantly decreased resistance, excellent cycling stability at high current density and flexibility in the full Li&#8208;S battery. This work provides valuable concepts in fabricating Li anodes toward Li&#8208;metal batteries and beyond for their high&#8208;level services.

         <title>Strong Ferromagnetism Achieved via Breathing Lattices in Atomically Thin Cobaltites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin cobaltite remaining strongly ferromagnetic is achieved by local structural modification. A surprisingly large magnetic moment (0.5 &#956;B/Co) and Curie temperature (75 K), values larger than previously reported for any monolayer oxides, are observed in the LaCoO3 monolayer, demonstrating a strategy for creating functional quantum heterostructures by exploiting atomic interface engineering.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials that remain strongly ferromagnetic down to monolayer thickness are highly desired for spintronic applications. Although oxide materials are important candidates for the next generation of spintronics, ferromagnetism decays severely when the thickness is scaled to the nanometer regime, leading to deterioration of device performance. Here, a methodology is reported for maintaining strong ferromagnetism in insulating LaCoO3 (LCO) layers down to the thickness of a single unit cell. It is found that the magnetic and electronic states of LCO are linked intimately to the structural parameters of adjacent &#8220;breathing lattice&#8221; SrCuO2 (SCO). As the dimensionality of SCO is reduced, the lattice constant elongates over 10% along the growth direction, leading to a significant distortion of the CoO6 octahedra, and promoting a higher spin state and long&#8208;range spin ordering. For atomically thin LCO layers, surprisingly large magnetic moment (0.5 &#956;B/Co) and Curie temperature (75 K), values larger than previously reported for any monolayer oxides are observed. The results demonstrate a strategy for creating ultrathin ferromagnetic oxides by exploiting atomic heterointerface engineering, confinement&#8208;driven structural transformation, and spin&#8208;lattice entanglement in strongly correlated materials.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Polar Optical Phonon to Piezoelectric Scattering in Few&#8208;Layer Bi2O2Se for High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermoelectric (TE) transport in few&#8208;layer Bi2O2Se is probed, where gating can effectively modulate its scattering mechanism from polar optical phonon to piezoelectric scattering. This facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering, and high TE performance over a wide range of temperature can be achieved due to persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism.








Abstract
Atomically thin Bi2O2Se has emerged as a new member in 2D materials with ultrahigh carrier mobility and excellent air&#8208;stability, showing great potential for electronics and optoelectronics. In addition, its ferroelectric nature renders an ultralow thermal conductivity, making it a perfect candidate for thermoelectrics. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of 2D Bi2O2Se is investigated over a wide temperature range (20&#8211;300 K). A gate&#8208;tunable transition from polar optical phonon (POP) scattering to piezoelectric scattering is observed, which facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering in 2D Bi2O2Se. Consequently, a high power factor of more than 400&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 over an unprecedented temperature range (80&#8211;200 K) is achieved, corresponding to the persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism. This finding provides a new avenue for maximizing thermoelectric performance by changing the scattering mechanism and carrier mobility over a wide temperature range.

&lt;p&gt;The thermoelectric (TE) transport in few&#8208;layer Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se is probed, where gating can effectively modulate its scattering mechanism from polar optical phonon to piezoelectric scattering. This facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering, and high TE performance over a wide range of temperature can be achieved due to persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically thin Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se has emerged as a new member in 2D materials with ultrahigh carrier mobility and excellent air&#8208;stability, showing great potential for electronics and optoelectronics. In addition, its ferroelectric nature renders an ultralow thermal conductivity, making it a perfect candidate for thermoelectrics. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of 2D Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se is investigated over a wide temperature range (20&#8211;300 K). A gate&#8208;tunable transition from polar optical phonon (POP) scattering to piezoelectric scattering is observed, which facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering in 2D Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se. Consequently, a high power factor of more than 400&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#181;&lt;/b&gt;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over an unprecedented temperature range (80&#8211;200 K) is achieved, corresponding to the persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism. This finding provides a new avenue for maximizing thermoelectric performance by changing the scattering mechanism and carrier mobility over a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging 2D and metal halide perovskites light&#8208;emitting materials for photonic integration are reviewed, including their unique optical properties, fabrication methods, and the progress made in realizing on&#8208;chip light emitters based on these materials. Moreover, the existing challenges and future perspectives are discussed toward the realization of high&#8208;efficiency light sources for optical interconnections.








Abstract
The arrival of the information explosion era is urging the development of large&#8208;bandwidth high&#8208;data&#8208;rate optical interconnection technology. Up to now, the biggest stumbling block in optical interconnections has been the lack of efficient light sources despite significant progress that has been made in germanium&#8208;on&#8208;silicon (Ge&#8208;on&#8208;Si) and III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;silicon (III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;Si) lasers. 2D materials and metal halide perovskites have attracted much attention in recent years, and exhibit distinctive advantages in the application of on&#8208;chip light emitters. Herein, this Progress Report reviews the recent progress made in light&#8208;emitting materials with a focus on new materials, i.e., 2D materials and metal halide perovskites. The report briefly introduces the current status of Ge&#8208;on&#8208;Si and III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;Si lasers and discusses the advances of 2D and perovskite light&#8208;emitting materials for photonic integration, including their optical properties, preparation methods, as well as the light sources based on these materials. Finally, challenges and perspectives of these emerging materials on the way to the efficient light sources are discussed.

         <title>Path&#8208;Dependent Thermal Metadevice beyond Janus Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D path&#8208;dependent thermal metadevice can be designed to achieve three heat transfer behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) along different directions at the same time by breaking the symmetry using successive 3D transformations. This path&#8208;dependent strategy provides a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field and for more general diffusion processes.








Abstract
Janus metamaterials, metasurfaces, and monolayers have received intensive attention in nanophotonics and 2D materials. Their core concept is to introduce asymmetry along the wave propagation direction, by stacking different materials or layers of meta&#8208;atoms, or breaking out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror asymmetry with external biases. Nevertheless, it has been hitherto elusive to realize a diffusive Janus metadevice, since scalar diffusion systems such as heat conduction normally operate in the absence of polarization control, spin manipulation, or electric&#8208;field stimuli, which all are widely used in achieving optical Janus devices. It is even more challenging, if not impossible, for a single diffusive metadevice to exhibit more than two thermal functions. Here a path&#8208;dependent thermal metadevice beyond Janus characteristics is proposed, which can exhibit three distinct thermal behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) under different directions of heat flow. The rotation transformation mechanism of thermal conductivity provides a robust platform to assign a specific thermal behavior in any direction. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of anisotropic in&#8208;plane conduction successfully validates such a path&#8208;dependent trifunction thermal metamaterial device. It is anticipated that this path&#8208;dependent strategy can provide a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field, as well as for a more general diffusion process.

         <title>Activatable Polymer Nanoenzymes for Photodynamic Immunometabolic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable organic nanoenzyme (SPNK) is developed for photodynamic immunometabolic cancer therapy. Near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation of SPNK can not only induce immunogenic cell death by photodynamic therapy but also activate kynureninase to in situ degrade immunosuppressive kynurenine, leading to enhanced systemic antitumor immunity and inhibition of both primary and distant tumors.








Abstract
Tumor immunometabolism contributes substantially to tumor proliferation and immune cell activity, and thus plays a crucial role in the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Modulation of immunometabolism to boost cancer immunotherapy is mostly based on small&#8208;molecule inhibitors, which often encounter the issues of off&#8208;target adverse effects, drug resistance, and unsustainable response. In contrast, enzymatic therapeutics can potentially bypass these limitations but has been less exploited. Herein, an organic polymer nanoenzyme (SPNK) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoactivatable immunotherapeutic effects is reported for photodynamic immunometabolic therapy. SPNK is composed of a semiconducting polymer core conjugated with kynureninase (KYNase) via PEGylated singlet oxygen (1O2) cleavable linker. Upon NIR photoirradiation, SPNK generates 1O2 not only to exert photodynamic effect to induce the immunogenic cell death of cancer, but also to unleash KYNase and trigger its activity to degrade the immunosuppressive kynurenine (Kyn). Such a combinational effect mediated by SPNK promotes the proliferation and infiltration of effector T cells, enhances systemic antitumor T cell immunity, and ultimately permits inhibition of both primary and distant tumors in living mice. Therefore, this study provides a promising photodynamic approach toward remotely controlled enzymatic immunomodulation for improved anticancer therapy.

         <title>Magnetic Moments Induced by Atomic Vacancies in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Flakes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Localized magnetic moments induced by Pt vacancies in air&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic PtSe2 nanoflakes are reported and the induced magnetic moments in PtSe2 nanoflakes are found to be nearly thickness dependent in thinner nanoflakes. The authors&#8217; findings demonstrate a new way to induce magnetism in non&#8208;magnetic 2D materials.








Abstract
2D magnetism plays a key role in both fundamental physics and potential device applications. However, the instability of the discovered 2D magnetic materials has been one main obstacle in deep research and potential application of 2D magnetism. Here, a localized magnetic moment induced by Pt vacancies in air&#8208;stable type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal PtSe2 flakes is reported. The localized magnetic moments give rise to the Kondo effect, evidenced by logarithmic increment of resistance with decreasing temperature and isotropic negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. Additionally, the induced magnetic moment and Kondo temperature appear to depend on thickness in the thinner samples (&lt;10&#160;nm). The small magnetocrystalline anisotropy revealed by first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the magnetic moments are randomly localized instead of long&#8208;range ordered. The findings demonstrate a new means to induce magnetism in 2D non&#8208;magnetic materials.

         <title>Amphipathic Side Chain of a Conjugated Polymer Optimizes Dopant Location toward Efficient N&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective increase in the Seebeck coefficient and improving the power factor by a factor of &#8776;5 in an n&#8208;doped donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer are realized by the use of amphipathic side chains. This strategy can properly control the dopant sites away from the backbone, which minimizes the adverse influence of counterions. Therefore, an excellent power factor of 18 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 is achieved.








Abstract
There is no molecular strategy for selectively increasing the Seebeck coefficient without reducing the electrical conductivity for organic thermoelectrics. Here, it is reported that the use of amphipathic side chains in an n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer can selectively increase the Seebeck coefficient and thus increase the power factor by a factor of &#8776;5. The amphipathic side chain contains an alkyl chain segment as a spacer between the polymer backbone and an ethylene glycol type chain segment. The use of this alkyl spacer does not only reduce the energetic disorder in the conjugated polymer film but can also properly control the dopant sites away from the backbone, which minimizes the adverse influence of counterions. As confirmed by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with the host&#8211;dopant distance as the only variable, a reduced Coulombic interaction resulting from a larger host&#8211;dopant distance contributes to a higher Seebeck coefficient for a given electrical conductivity. Finally, an optimized power factor of 18 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 is achieved in the doped polymer film. This work provides a facile molecular strategy for selectively improving the Seebeck coefficient and opens up a new route for optimizing the dopant location toward realizing better n&#8208;type polymeric thermoelectrics.

&lt;p&gt;Selective increase in the Seebeck coefficient and improving the power factor by a factor of &#8776;5 in an n&#8208;doped donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer are realized by the use of amphipathic side chains. This strategy can properly control the dopant sites away from the backbone, which minimizes the adverse influence of counterions. Therefore, an excellent power factor of 18 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no molecular strategy for selectively increasing the Seebeck coefficient without reducing the electrical conductivity for organic thermoelectrics. Here, it is reported that the use of amphipathic side chains in an n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer can selectively increase the Seebeck coefficient and thus increase the power factor by a factor of &#8776;5. The amphipathic side chain contains an alkyl chain segment as a spacer between the polymer backbone and an ethylene glycol type chain segment. The use of this alkyl spacer does not only reduce the energetic disorder in the conjugated polymer film but can also properly control the dopant sites away from the backbone, which minimizes the adverse influence of counterions. As confirmed by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with the host&#8211;dopant distance as the only variable, a reduced Coulombic interaction resulting from a larger host&#8211;dopant distance contributes to a higher Seebeck coefficient for a given electrical conductivity. Finally, an optimized power factor of 18 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in the doped polymer film. This work provides a facile molecular strategy for selectively improving the Seebeck coefficient and opens up a new route for optimizing the dopant location toward realizing better n&#8208;type polymeric thermoelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fast Response Organic Supramolecular Transistors Utilizing In&#8208;Situ &#960;&#8208;Ion Gels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of supramolecular devices is presented. In a device dubbed a &#960;&#8208;ion gel transistor (PIGT), an in situ &#960;&#8208;ion gel is directly employed as a core part of the device. PIGT exhibits volumetric conductivity with an ultrafast response time. The device configuration is rational to induce the potent property of &#960;&#8208;gels to a macroscale device.








Abstract
Despite their remarkable charge carrier mobility when forming well&#8208;ordered fibers, supramolecular transistors often suffer from poor processability that hinders device integration, resulting in disappointing transconductance and output currents. Here, a new class of supramolecular transistors, &#960;&#8208;ion gel transistors (PIGTs), is presented. An in situ &#960;&#8208;ion gel, which is an unprecedented composite of semiconducting nanofibers and an enclosed ionic liquid, is directly employed as an active material and internal capacitor. In comparison to other supramolecular transistors, a PIGT displays a high transconductance (133 &#181;S) and output current (139 &#181;A at &#8722;6 V), while retaining a high charge&#8208;carrier mobility (4.2 &#215; 10&#8722;2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and on/off ratio (3.7 &#215; 104). Importantly, the unique device configuration and the high ionic conductivity associated with the distinct nanosegregation enables the fastest response among accumulation&#8208;mode electrochemical&#8208;based transistors (&lt;20 &#181;s). Considering the advantages of the absence of dielectric layers and the facile fabrication process, PIGT has great potential to be utilized in printed flexible devices. The device platform is widely applicable to various supramolecular assemblies, shedding light on the interdisciplinary research of supramolecular chemistry and organic electronics.

         <title>Redox Targeting&#8208;Based Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycle Flow Cell for Enhanced Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harnessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox targeting (RT)&#8208;based thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle flow cell via the RT&#8208;reactions between redox mediators and solid materials is demonstrated with combined advantages of redox flow battery and static battery for enhanced thermoelectric energy conversion and decoupled high&#8208;energy&#8208;density large&#8208;scale electricity storage.








Abstract
A large amount of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is produced in electrical devices and mostly wasted. This type of heat without effective dissipation also causes compromised device performance, reliability, and lifespan. To tackle these issues, a redox targeting (RT)&#8208;based flow cell with judiciously designed thermoelectrically active redox materials is demonstrated for the first time for efficient heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion through a thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC). Compared with the conventional TREC systems, the RT&#8208;based flow cell not only reveals considerably enhanced thermoelectric efficiency, but the flow of redox fluids also provides a cooling function to the system. In this work, solid material Ni0.2Co0.8(OH)2 and redox mediator [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, both of which have negative temperature coefficient and share identical redox potential, are paired via RT&#8208;reactions to boost the capacity and meanwhile thermoelectric efficiency of a [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;/Zn0/2+&#8208;based flow cell. Upon operating over the TREC cycle, the RT&#8208;based flow cell converts heat to electricity at an unprecedented absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 3.61% in the temperature range of 25&#8211;55&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Perovskite Narrowband Photodetectors with Tunable Spectral Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filterless and self&#8208;driven charge&#8208;collection&#8208;narrowing (CCN)&#8208;type perovskite narrowband photodetectors are fabricated with tunable spectral responses from the red to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. Specifically, the MAPbI3&#8208;based narrowband photodetector exhibits remarkable performances at 800&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half maximum less than 30&#160;nm, which are comparable to the highest reported values, allowing to successfully demonstration of narrowband imaging.








Abstract
Narrowband photodetectors with tunable spectral responses are highly desirable for applications in image sensing, machine vision, and optical communication. Herein, a filterless and self&#8208;driven perovskite narrowband photodetector (PNPD) based on the defect&#8208;assisted charge collection narrowing (CCN) mechanism is reported, which is enabled by a high&#8208;quality thick perovskite film. By adjusting the halide component of the perovskite layer, the bandgap is successfully modulated and the corresponding narrowband photodetectors show a wide spectral response range from the red to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR), all with full&#8208;widths at half maximum (FWHMs) below 30&#160;nm. Specifically, the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) narrowband photodetector exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 800&#160;nm with a very low noise current of &#8776;0.02 pA Hz&#8211;1/2, a high specific detectivity up to 1.27 &#215; 1012 Jones, and a fast response speed with rise/fall time of 12.7/6.9 &#181;s. Impressively, these values are among the highest of their kind reported previously, and allow demonstration of narrowband imaging. The excellent performance of self&#8208;driven PNPDs lights up their prospect in high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices without external power sources.

         <title>Extracellular&#8208;Matrix&#8208;Reinforced Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting Human Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a new class of microscale phase&#8208;separated hybrid bioinks is described by combining tissue specific extracellular matrix (ECM) with alginate. This novel rECM hybrid bioink is tissue specific, cytocompatible, biocompatible, and pro&#8208;angiogenic and is used to bioprint human airways composed of multiple, regionally specified primary human lung cell types.








Abstract
Recent advances in 3D bioprinting allow for generating intricate structures with dimensions relevant for human tissue, but suitable bioinks for producing translationally relevant tissue with complex geometries remain unidentified. Here, a tissue&#8208;specific hybrid bioink is described, composed of a natural polymer, alginate, reinforced with extracellular matrix derived from decellularized tissue (rECM). rECM has rheological and gelation properties beneficial for 3D bioprinting while retaining biologically inductive properties supporting tissue maturation ex vivo and in vivo. These bioinks are shear thinning, resist cell sedimentation, improve viability of multiple cell types, and enhance mechanical stability in hydrogels derived from them. 3D printed constructs generated from rECM bioinks suppress the foreign body response, are pro&#8208;angiogenic and support recipient&#8208;derived de novo blood vessel formation across the entire graft thickness in a murine model of transplant immunosuppression. Their proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for generating human tissue is demonstrated by 3D bioprinting human airways composed of regionally specified primary human airway epithelial progenitor and smooth muscle cells. Airway lumens remained patent with viable cells for one month in vitro with evidence of differentiation into mature epithelial cell types found in native human airways. rECM bioinks are a promising new approach for generating functional human tissue using 3D bioprinting.

         <title>Revealing the Degradation and Self&#8208;Healing Mechanisms in Perovskite Solar Cells by Sub&#8208;Bandgap External Quantum Efficiency Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap external quantum efficiency (s&#8208;EQE) spectroscopy for in situ monitoring the ion dissociation process is developed for the first time to reveal the mechanism of the intrinsic perovskite material degradation.








Abstract
Ion dissociation has been identified to determine the intrinsic stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), but the underlying degradation mechanism is still elusive. Herein, by combining highly sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap external quantum efficiency (s&#8208;EQE) spectroscopy, impedance analysis, and theoretical calculations, the evolution of defect states in PVSCs during the degradation can be monitored. It is found that the degradation of PVSCs can be divided into three steps: 1) dissociation of ions from perovskite lattices, 2) migration of dissociated ions, and 3) consumption of I&#8722; by reacting with metal electrode. Importantly, step (3) is found to be crucial as it will accelerate the first two steps and lead to continuous degradation. By replacing the metal with more chemically robust indium tin oxide (ITO), it is found that the dissociated ions under light soaking will only saturate at the perovskite/ITO interface. Importantly, the dissociated ions will subsequently restore to the corresponding vacancies under dark condition to heal the perovskite and photovoltaic performance. Such shuttling of mobile ions without consumption in the ITO&#8208;contact PVSCs results in harvesting&#8211;rest&#8211;recovery cycles in natural day/night operation. It is envisioned that the mechanism of the intrinsic perovskite material degradation reported here will lead to clearer research directions toward highly stable PVSCs.

         <title>The Earth's Lithosphere Inspires Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lithomimetic approach is proposed, which entails mimicking structures and processes occurring in the Earth's lithosphere to produce man&#8208;made advanced materials. Severe plastic deformation is considered as a viable vehicle for that.








Abstract
Structural patterns found in living organisms have long been inspiring biomimetic materials design. Here, it is suggested that a rich palette of patterns occurring in inanimate Nature, and especially in the Earth's lithosphere, could be not less inspirational for design of novel architectured materials. This materials design paradigm is referred to as lithomimetics and it is demonstrated that some of the patterns found in the lithosphere can be emulated by established processes of severe plastic deformation. This opens up interesting avenues for materials design in which potentially promising structural patterns are borrowed from the lithosphere's repository. The key aim here is to promulgate the &#8220;lithomimetics&#8221; paradigm as a promising approach to developing novel architectured materials.

         <title>Voluntary&#8208;Opsonization&#8208;Enabled Precision Nanomedicines for Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly engineered liposomes are shown to &#8220;hitch&#8208;hike&#8221; neutrophils through complementary &#8220;voluntary opsonization&#8221;. The chemotaxis of neutrophils overcomes the physiological barriers and dramatically enhances the accumulation of nanomedicines in the inflamed lungs for effective inflammation treatment. This strategy opens up new paths for neutrophil&#8208;enabled precision nanomedicines for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.








Abstract
Nanomedicines that target specific blood cells represent an emerging strategy to improve drug biodistribution. However, the protein corona usually disrupts nanomedicine targeting to cells and tissues. Herein, instead of exploring synthetic methods to mitigate the impact of the protein corona, its natural interactions with blood cells are leveraged and turn the protein corona into an active ingredient in treating lung inflammation. It is discovered that molecularly engineered liposomes with inverse phosphocholine lipids rapidly enrich complement fragment iC3b by &#8220;voluntary opsonization,&#8221; which triggers neutrophil hijacking through complement receptor 3 phagocytosis. This neutrophil targeting is cell&#8208;state dependent as only those activated by acute inflammation display efficient neutrophil reconstruction. The liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils migrate across the alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier, accumulate in the inflamed lung parenchyma within hours, and release their payloads to kill the bacteria. This work shows that, in addition to biological cells, the protein corona can be a new platform for active and precision nanomedicine.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Modulated Multidirectional Photothermal Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic&#8211;plasmonic hybrid Fe3O4/Ag nanorods are used as building blocks to create a freestanding, multidirectional photothermal robot. The hybrid nanorods are magnetically aligned with perfect orientational order in specific robot domains to enable on&#8208;demand locomotion by modulating the polarization and on&#8211;off switching of a laser beam.








Abstract
Photothermal actuators have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to convert light energy into mechanical deformation and locomotion. This work reports a freestanding, multidirectional photothermal robot that can walk along a predesigned pathway by modulating laser polarization and on&#8211;off switching. Magnetic&#8211;plasmonic hybrid Fe3O4/Ag nanorods are synthesized using an unconventional templating approach. The coupled magnetic and plasmonic anisotropy allows control of the rod orientation, plasmonic excitation, and photothermal conversion by simply applying a magnetic field. Once the rods are fixed with desirable orientations in a bimorph actuator by magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted lithography, the bending of the actuator can be controlled by switching the laser polarization. A bipedal robot is created by coupling the rod orientation with the alternating actuation of its two legs. Irradiating the robot by a laser with alternating or fixed polarization synergistically results in basic movement (backward and forward) and turning (including left&#8208;, right&#8208;, and U&#8208;turn), respectively. A complex walk along predesigned pathways can be potentially programmed by combining the movement and turning modes of the robots. This strategy provides an alternative driving mechanism for preparing functional soft robots, thus breaking through the limitations in the existing systems in terms of light sources and actuation manners.

         <title>Reaction Mechanism and Structural Evolution of Fluorographite Cathodes in Solid&#8208;State K/Na/Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The real&#8208;time K/Na/Li ion insertion mobility and reaction mechanism of the CFx cathode are studied using an in situ all&#8208;solid&#8208;state nanobattery transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique. A two&#8208;phase reaction is discovered with crystalline KF (NaF nanoparticles and amorphous LiF) generated uniformly within an amorphous carbon matrix, retaining an unchanged volume during alkali&#8208;ion intercalation.








Abstract
Fluorographites (CFx) are ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for alkaline&#8208;metal primary batteries. However, they are generally not rechargeable. To elucidate the reaction mechanism of CFx cathodes, in situ transmission electron microscopy characterizations and ab initio calculations are employed. It is found that it is a two&#8208;phase mechanism upon K/Na/Li ion insertion; crystalline KF (crystalline NaF nanoparticles and amorphous LiF) is generated uniformly within the amorphous carbon matrix, retaining an unchanged volume during the discharge process. The diffusivity for K/Na/Li ion migration within the CFx is &#8776;2.2&#8211;2.5 &#215; 10&#8211;12, 3.4&#8211;5.3 &#215; 10&#8211;12 , and 1.8&#8211;2.5 &#215; 10&#8211;11 cm2 s&#8211;1, respectively, which is comparable to the diffusivity of K/Na/Li ions in liquid&#8208;state cells. Encouraged by the in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results, a new rechargeable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/CFx battery is further designed that shows a part of the reversible specific discharge capacity at the 2nd cycle. These findings demonstrate that a solid&#8208;state electrolyte provides a different reaction process compared with a conventional liquid electrolyte, and enables CFx to be partly rechargeable in solid&#8208;state Li batteries.

         <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Novel Semimetals: A Case Study of YbMnSb2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of the YbMnSb2 nodal line semimetal demonstrate the synergetic contribution of Dirac bands and regular band to the thermoelectric performance. A high power factor over 2.1 mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 is achieved due to both high mobility and large thermopower.








Abstract
The emerging class of topological materials provides a platform to engineer exotic electronic structures for a variety of applications. As complex band structures and Fermi surfaces can directly benefit thermoelectric performance it is important to identify the role of featured topological bands in thermoelectrics particularly when there are coexisting classic regular bands. In this work, the contribution of Dirac bands to thermoelectric performance and their ability to concurrently achieve large thermopower and low resistivity in novel semimetals is investigated. By examining the YbMnSb2 nodal line semimetal as an example, the Dirac bands appear to provide a low resistivity along the direction in which they are highly dispersive. Moreover, because of the regular&#8208;band&#8208;provided density of states, a large Seebeck coefficient over 160 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 300 K is achieved in both directions, which is very high for a semimetal with high carrier concentration. The combined highly dispersive Dirac and regular bands lead to ten times increase in power factor, reaching a value of 2.1&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 300 K. The present work highlights the potential of such novel semimetals for unusual electronic transport properties and guides strategies towards high thermoelectric performance.

         <title>Roles of MACl in Sequentially Deposited Bromine&#8208;Free Perovskite Absorbers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of methylammonium chloride (MACl) in sequentially deposited bromine (Br)&#8208;free formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite is systematically demonstrated to regulate the PbI2/FAI reaction, tune the phase transition at room temperature, and adjust the PbI2 residual through an intermediate&#8208;related perovskite decomposition during thermal annealing. The resulting optimized solar cells achieve a remarkable efficiency of 23.1% with considerably improved photostability.








Abstract
So far, the combination of methylammonium bromide/methylammonium chloride (MABr/MACl) or methylammonium iodide (MAI)/MACl is the most frequently used additives to stabilize formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) fabricated by the sequential deposition method. However, the enlarged bandgap due to the addition of bromide and the ambiguous functions of these additives in lead iodide (PbI2) transformation are still worth considering. Herein, the roles of MACl in sequentially deposited Br&#8208;free FA&#8208;based perovskites are systematically investigated. It is found that MACl can finely regulate the PbI2/FAI reaction, tune the phase transition at room temperature, and adjust intermediate&#8208;related perovskite crystallization and decomposition during thermal annealing. Compared to FAPbI3, the perovskite with MACl exhibits larger grain, longer carrier lifetime, and reduced trap density. The resultant solar cell therefore achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% under reverse scan with a stabilized power output of 23.0%. In addition, it shows much improved photostability under 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 white illumination (xenon lamp) in nitrogen atmosphere without encapsulation.

         <title>Biopolymer Immune Implants&#8217; Sequential Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity for Colorectal Cancer Postoperative Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a biopolymer immune implant for colorectal cancer post&#8208;surgical management. The implant sequentially elicits innate, adaptive, and memory immune responses, and results in complete residual tumor clearance, inhibition of tumor recurrence and distal tumor, and resistance to tumor re&#8208;challenge. The results presented will encourage potential clinical translation of this optimized implant upon tumor resection.








Abstract
Surgical resection is the first&#8208;line therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, for advanced CRC, the curative effect of surgical resection is limited due to either local recurrence or distal metastasis. Postoperative in situ immunotherapy, presents a promising option for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis, owing to the fact that surgeons have unique opportunities and direct access to the surgical site. Herein, a designed biopolymer immune implant for CRC post&#8208;surgical therapy, characterized with tissue adhesion, sustained drug release, and sequential elicitation of innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and immune memory effects, is reported. With gradual release of the loaded resiquimod (R848) and anti&#8208;OX40 antibody (aOX40), the immune implant can eradicate residual tumors post&#8208;surgery (with no tumor recurrence in 150 days), inhibit the growth of distal tumors and elicit immune memory effects to resist tumor re&#8208;challenge. Immunological analysis reveal that the biopolymer immune plant treatment leads to a two&#8208;stage action, with enhanced natural killer cells (NK cells) infiltration and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the first several days, then a greatly increased population of infiltrating T cells, and finally immune memory effects are established. The reported biopolymer immune implants provide a valuable and clinically&#8208;relevant option for post&#8208;surgical CRC management.

         <title>Driving Force and Optical Signatures of Bipolaron Formation in Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically doped donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymer is studied using ultrafast spectroscopy, showing conclusively that the carriers created by doping are exclusively bipolarons and not single polarons at all doping levels. DFT calculations show that the physical size of the donor unit is what determines the relative stability of polarons and bipolarons in push&#8211;pull semiconducting polymer systems.








Abstract
Molecular dopants are often added to semiconducting polymers to improve electrical conductivity. However, the use of such dopants does not always produce mobile charge carriers. In this work, ultrafast spectroscopy is used to explore the nature of the carriers created following doping of conjugated push&#8211;pull polymers with both F4TCNQ (2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane) and FeCl3. It is shown that for one particular push&#8211;pull material, the charge carriers created by doping are entirely non&#8208;conductive bipolarons and not single polarons, and that transient absorption spectroscopy following excitation in the infrared can readily distinguish the two types of charge carriers. Based on density functional theory calculations and experiments on multiple push&#8211;pull conjugated polymers, it is argued that the size of the donor push units determines the relative stabilities of polarons and bipolarons, with larger donor units stabilizing the bipolarons by providing more area for two charges to&#160;co&#8208;reside.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Photocatalysts Optimized by Spatially Separated Cocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterostructured photocatalyst, Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (PUM), is constructed based on the rational optimization of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 with spatially separated Pt and MnOx nanoparticles as cocatalysts. The optimization results in a long lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the composite, which can drive overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation and utilization are critical factors in photocatalysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that the complete spatial separation of oxidation and reduction cocatalysts enhances the efficacy of charge separation and surface reaction. Specifically, a Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (PUM) heterostructured photocatalyst with Pt and MnOx as cocatalysts is designed for the optimization of the NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 photocatalyst. Compared with the pristine NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (PU), and NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (UM) samples, the PUM sample exhibits the highest hydrogen production activity. As cocatalysts, Pt favors trapping of electrons, while MnOx tends to collect holes. Upon generation from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, electrons and holes flow inward and outward of the metal&#8211;organic framework photocatalyst, accumulating on the corresponding cocatalysts, and then take part in the redox reactions. The PUM photocatalyst greatly prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes, which favors the electron&#8211;hole separation. Furthermore, the PUM sample facilitates overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents, thereby demonstrating its potential as a modification method of MOF&#8208;type semiconductors for the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient charge separation and utilization are critical factors in photocatalysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that the complete spatial separation of oxidation and reduction cocatalysts enhances the efficacy of charge separation and surface reaction. Specifically, a Pt@NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (PUM) heterostructured photocatalyst with Pt and MnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; as cocatalysts is designed for the optimization of the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 photocatalyst. Compared with the pristine NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, Pt@NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (PU), and NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (UM) samples, the PUM sample exhibits the highest hydrogen production activity. As cocatalysts, Pt favors trapping of electrons, while MnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; tends to collect holes. Upon generation from NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, electrons and holes flow inward and outward of the metal&#8211;organic framework photocatalyst, accumulating on the corresponding cocatalysts, and then take part in the redox reactions. The PUM photocatalyst greatly prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes, which favors the electron&#8211;hole separation. Furthermore, the PUM sample facilitates overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents, thereby demonstrating its potential as a modification method of MOF&#8208;type semiconductors for the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Charge&#8211;Ferroelectric Transition in Ultrathin Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 Flakes Probed via a Dual&#8208;Gated Full van der Waals Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;gated MoS2 ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor in full van der Waals structure is demonstrated with a thin Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 flake as the ferroelectric gate dielectric. Hysteresis behaviors can be electrostatically controlled by dual&#8208;gating from charge dynamic (clockwise) to ferroelectric (counterclockwise). This allows a multifunctional device with its operation switchable from short&#8208;term memory to nonvolatile ferroelectric memory.








Abstract
Ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) have recently attracted enormous attention owing to their applications in nonvolatile memories and low&#8208;power logic electronics. However, the current mainstream thin&#8208;film&#8208;based ferroelectrics lack good compatibility with the emergent 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In this work, the synthesis of thin ferroelectric Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 (NBIT) flakes by a molten&#8208;salt method is reported. With a dry&#8208;transferred NBIT flake serving as the top&#8208;gate dielectric, dual&#8208;gate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) FeFETs are fabricated in a full vdW stacking structure. Barrier&#8208;free graphene contacts allow the investigation of intrinsic carrier transport of MoS2 governed by lattice scattering. Thanks to the high dielectric constant of &#8776;94 in NBIT, a metal to insulator transition with a high electron concentration of 3.0 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2 is achieved in MoS2 under top&#8208;gate modulation. The electron field&#8208;effect mobility as high as 182 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 88 K is obtained. The as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 FeFET exhibits clockwise hysteresis transfer curves that originate from charge trapping/release with either top&#8208;gate or back&#8208;gate modulation. Interestingly, hysteresis behavior can be controlled from clockwise to counterclockwise using dual&#8208;gate. A multifunctional device utilizing this unique property of NBIT, which is switchable electrostatically between short&#8208;term memory and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory, is envisaged.

         <title>Engineering of Living Cells with Polyphenol&#8208;Functionalized Biologically Active Nanocomplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, adaptable, polyphenol&#8208;based molecular engineering platform &#8220;Cellnex&#8221; is reported as a rapid and efficient approach to functionalize cell surfaces with biomolecules. This platform enables the customized engineering of a wide range of mammalian cells with diverse classes of biomolecules. Cells engineered with this approach are capable of achieving targeted biomolecule delivery and improving the biological outcomes of respective biomolecules.








Abstract
Approaches to safely and effectively augment cellular functions without compromising the inherent biological properties of the cells, especially through the integration of biologically labile domains, remain of great interest. Here, a versatile strategy to assemble biologically active nanocomplexes, including proteins, DNA, mRNA, and even viral carriers, on cellular surfaces to generate a cell&#8208;based hybrid system referred to as &#8220;Cellnex&#8221; is established. This strategy can be used to engineer a wide range of cell types used in adoptive cell transfers, including erythrocytes, macrophages, NK cells, T cells, etc. Erythrocytenex can enhance the delivery of cargo proteins to the lungs in vivo by 11&#8208;fold as compared to the free cargo counterpart. Biomimetic microfluidic experiments and modeling provided detailed insights into the targeting mechanism. In addition, Macrophagenex is capable of enhancing the therapeutic efficiency of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint inhibitors in vivo. This simple and adaptable approach may offer a platform for the rapid generation of complex cellular systems.

         <title>Composite Nanostructure Construction on the Grain Surface of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite nanostructure comprising a uniform LiTaO3 coating layer and the oriented growth of a spinel interlayer structure is constructed on the grain surface of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The surface composite nanostructure modification can significantly improve the voltage maintenance, cycle stability, rate performance, and thermal stability of LLOs.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) are fascinating high&#8208;energy cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but still suffer from critical drawbacks that retard their practical applications. Although surface modification is effective to protect LLOs from structural deterioration, the delicate design of structures on a grain surface with promising scalability for industrial application is still challenging. Herein, using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, a composite nanostructure comprising a uniform LiTaO3 coating layer (&#8776;3 nm) and a spinel interlayer structure (&#8776;1 nm) is constructed on the grain surface of industrial LLO (Li1.13Mn0.517Ni0.256Co0.097O2) agglomerated spheres. The surface composite nanostructure can not only enhance the structural/interfacial stability of the LLO, but also facilitates Li+ diffusion, thereby significantly improving its cycle stability, rate performance, thermal stability, and voltage maintenance. Specifically, the LLO coated with 10 ALD cycles exhibits a small voltage decay rate of 0.9 mV per cycle, a reversible capacity of 272.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, and a capacity retention of 85% after 200 cycles at 1 C, suggesting the important role of surface composite nanostructure for improving the electrochemical performance. This work provides new insights into the composite nanostructure design on the grain surface of cathode materials for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Stable Potassium Metal Anodes with an All&#8208;Aluminum Current Collector through Improved Electrolyte Wetting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free electrochemical cycling of potassium metal anodes is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting on a geometrically rough all&#8208;aluminum current collector. The electrolyte was standard potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane and no modifications were made to the collector surface chemistry. The key takeaway from this study is that good electrolyte wetting is necessary for stable plating/stripping, with poor wetting ensuring instability and dendrite growth.








Abstract
This is the first report of successful potassium metal battery anode cycling with an aluminum&#8208;based rather than copper&#8208;based current collector. Dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting, employing an aluminum&#8208;powder&#8208;coated aluminum foil &#8220;Al@Al,&#8221; without any modification of the support surface chemistry or electrolyte additives. The reservoir&#8208;free Al@Al half&#8208;cell is stable at 1000 cycles (1950&#160;h) at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with 98.9% cycling Coulombic efficiency and 0.085&#160;V overpotential. The pre&#8208;potassiated cell is stable through a wide current range, including 130&#160;cycles (2600 min) at 3.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with 0.178&#160;V overpotential. Al@Al is fully wetted by a 4 m potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte (&#952;CA&#160;= 0&#176;), producing a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the initial galvanostatic formation cycles. On planar aluminum foil with a nearly identical surface oxide, the electrolyte wets poorly (&#952;CA&#160;= 52&#176;). This correlates with coarse irregular SEI clumps at formation, 3D potassium islands with further SEI coarsening during plating/stripping, possibly dead potassium metal on stripped surfaces, and rapid failure. The electrochemical stability of Al@Al versus planar Al is not related to differences in potassiophilicity (nearly identical) as obtained from thermal wetting experiments. Planar Cu foils are also poorly electrolyte&#8208;wetted and become dendritic.

     alt="Stable Potassium Metal Anodes with an All&#8208;Aluminum Current Collector through Improved Electrolyte Wetting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendrite&#8208;free electrochemical cycling of potassium metal anodes is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting on a geometrically rough all&#8208;aluminum current collector. The electrolyte was standard potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane and no modifications were made to the collector surface chemistry. The key takeaway from this study is that good electrolyte wetting is necessary for stable plating/stripping, with poor wetting ensuring instability and dendrite growth.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first report of successful potassium metal battery anode cycling with an aluminum&#8208;based rather than copper&#8208;based current collector. Dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting, employing an aluminum&#8208;powder&#8208;coated aluminum foil &#8220;Al@Al,&#8221; without any modification of the support surface chemistry or electrolyte additives. The reservoir&#8208;free Al@Al half&#8208;cell is stable at 1000 cycles (1950&#160;h) at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with 98.9% cycling Coulombic efficiency and 0.085&#160;V overpotential. The pre&#8208;potassiated cell is stable through a wide current range, including 130&#160;cycles (2600 min) at 3.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with 0.178&#160;V overpotential. Al@Al is fully wetted by a 4 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte (&#952;&lt;sub&gt;CA&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&lt;b&gt;=&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;), producing a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the initial galvanostatic formation cycles. On planar aluminum foil with a nearly identical surface oxide, the electrolyte wets poorly (&#952;&lt;sub&gt;CA&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&lt;b&gt;=&lt;/b&gt; 52&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;). This correlates with coarse irregular SEI clumps at formation, 3D potassium islands with further SEI coarsening during plating/stripping, possibly dead potassium metal on stripped surfaces, and rapid failure. The electrochemical stability of Al@Al versus planar Al is not related to differences in potassiophilicity (nearly identical) as obtained from thermal wetting experiments. Planar Cu foils are also poorly electrolyte&#8208;wetted and become dendritic. The key fundamental takeaway is that the incomplete electrolyte wetting of collectors results in early onset of SEI instability and dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;

Advancement in microelectronics technology enables autonomous edge&#8208;computing platforms the size of a dust mote. Dust&#8208;sized III&#8211;V photovoltaic cells grown on a Si substrate can be integrated using a wafer&#8208;level&#8208;packaging process for heterogeneous integration with other chiplets and achieve high power density.

Abstract
Advancement in microelectronics technology enables autonomous edge computing platforms in the size of a dust mote (&lt;1 mm),&#160;bringing efficient and low&#8208;cost artificial intelligence close to the end user and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) applications. The key challenge for these compact high&#8208;performance edge computers is the integration of a power source that satisfies the high&#8208;power&#8208;density requirement and does not increase the complexity and cost of the packaging. Here, it is shown that dust&#8208;sized III&#8211;V photovoltaic (PV) cells grown on Si and silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator (SOI) substrates can be integrated using a wafer&#8208;level&#8208;packaging process and achieve higher power density than all prior micro&#8208;PVs on Si and SOI substrates. The high&#8208;throughput heterogeneous integration unlocks the potential of large&#8208;scale manufacturing of these integrated systems with low cost for IoT applications. The negative effect of crystallographic defects in the heteroepitaxial materials on PV performance diminishes at high power density. Simultaneous power delivery and data transmission to the dust mote with heteroepitaxially grown PV are also demonstrated using hand&#8208;held illumination sources.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Enhanced Yield Strength in a Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lattice distortions of the NbTaTiV and NbTaTiVZr refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are quantitatively calculated and measured by various techniques. The relationship between the lattice distortion and yield strength is clearly demonstrated by the addition of Zr elements in an NbTaTiV HEA, resulting in an enhanced yield strength due to the increased lattice distortion.








Abstract
Severe distortion is one of the four core effects in single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) and contributes significantly to the yield strength. However, the connection between the atomic&#8208;scale lattice distortion and macro&#8208;scale mechanical properties through experimental verification has yet to be fully achieved, owing to two critical challenges: 1) the difficulty in the development of homogeneous single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution HEAs and 2) the ambiguity in describing the lattice distortion and related measurements and calculations. A single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) refractory HEA, NbTaTiVZr, using thermodynamic modeling coupled with experimental verifications, is developed. Compared to the previously developed single&#8208;phase NbTaTiV HEA, the NbTaTiVZr HEA shows a higher yield strength and comparable plasticity. The increase in yield strength is systematically and quantitatively studied in terms of lattice distortion using a theoretical model, first&#8208;principles calculations, synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction, atom&#8208;probe tomography, and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. These results demonstrate that severe lattice distortion is a core factor for developing high strengths in refractory HEAs.

         <title>Preferentially Engineering FeN4 Edge Sites onto Graphitic Nanosheets for Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Edge&#8208;enriched FeN4 site integration into the highly graphitic nanosheet architecture is developed for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis in rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Benefiting from the structural merits, the as&#8208;developed catalyst displays impressive performance in a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery prototype with a low charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap of 0.78&#160;V and long&#8208;term cyclability for over 240 cycles.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom FeN4 sites at the edges of carbon substrates are considered more active for oxygen electrocatalysis than those in plane; however, the conventional high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis process does not allow for precisely engineering the location of the active site down to atomic level. Enlightened by theoretical prediction, herein, a self&#8208;sacrificed templating approach is developed to obtain edge&#8208;enriched FeN4 sites integrated in the highly graphitic nanosheet architecture. The in situ formed Fe clusters are intentionally introduced to catalyze the growth of graphitic carbon, induce porous structure formation, and most importantly, facilitate the preferential anchoring of FeN4 to its close approximation. Due to these attributes, the as&#8208;resulted catalyst (denoted as Fe/N&#8208;G&#8208;SAC) demonstrates unprecedented catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by showing an impressive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V for the ORR and a small overpotential of 370&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the OER. Moreover, the Fe/N&#8208;G&#8208;SAC cathode displays encouraging performance in a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery prototype with a low charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap of 0.78&#160;V and long&#8208;term cyclability for over 240 cycles, outperforming the noble metal benchmarks.

         <title>Synergistic Optimization Enables Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells to Maintain over 98% PCE of the Small&#8208;Area Rigid Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
With&#160;synergistic&#160;optimization of the active layer morphology, flexible substrate properties, and processing temperature, large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells with high performance are achieved by the slot&#8208;die coating process. The 1 cm2 flexible devices produce an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.16%, and, for modules with an area of 25 cm2, an extraordinary PCE of 10.09% is observed.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is generally regarded as the most effective large&#8208;scale methodology for the fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the corresponding device performance significantly lags behind spin&#8208;coated devices. Herein, the active layer morphology, flexible substrate properties, and the processing temperature are optimized synergistically to obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for both the flexible single cells and the modules. As a result, the 1 cm2 flexible devices produce an excellent PCE of 12.16% as compared to 12.37% for the spin&#8208;coated small&#8208;area (0.04 cm2) rigid devices. Likewise, for modules with an area of 25 cm2, an extraordinary PCE of 10.09% is observed. Hence, efficiency losses associated with the upscaling are significantly reduced by the synergistic optimization. Moreover, after 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 10&#160;mm, the flexible devices still produce over 99% of their initial PCE, whereas after being stored for over 6000 h in a glove box, the PCE reaches 103% of its initial value, indicating excellent device flexibility as well as superior shelf stability. These results, thus, are a promising confirmation the great potential for upscaling of large&#8208;area OSCs in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;With&#160;synergistic&#160;optimization of the active layer morphology, flexible substrate properties, and processing temperature, large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells with high performance are achieved by the slot&#8208;die coating process. The 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible devices produce an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.16%, and, for modules with an area of 25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an extraordinary PCE of 10.09% is observed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot&#8208;die coating is generally regarded as the most effective large&#8208;scale methodology for the fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the corresponding device performance significantly lags behind spin&#8208;coated devices. Herein, the active layer morphology, flexible substrate properties, and the processing temperature are optimized synergistically to obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for both the flexible single cells and the modules. As a result, the 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible devices produce an excellent PCE of 12.16% as compared to 12.37% for the spin&#8208;coated small&#8208;area (0.04 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) rigid devices. Likewise, for modules with an area of 25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an extraordinary PCE of 10.09% is observed. Hence, efficiency losses associated with the upscaling are significantly reduced by the synergistic optimization. Moreover, after 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 10&#160;mm, the flexible devices still produce over 99% of their initial PCE, whereas after being stored for over 6000 h in a glove box, the PCE reaches 103% of its initial value, indicating excellent device flexibility as well as superior shelf stability. These results, thus, are a promising confirmation the great potential for upscaling of large&#8208;area OSCs in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Titanium&#8211;Bromine Flow Battery with Ultrahigh Cycle Stability for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;cycle and low&#8208;cost titanium&#8211;bromine flow battery is achieved with the help of a novel bromine complexing agent (CHA) and a porous polyolefin membrane. The CHA can not only capture the polybromides with a large size excluded by a membrane but also can keep the positive electrolyte in a nearly homogeneous phase, which endows the battery with outstanding stability.








Abstract
Flow batteries are one of the most promising large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems. However, the currently used flow batteries have low operation&#8211;cost&#8208;effectiveness and exhibit low energy density, which limits their commercialization. Herein, a titanium&#8211;bromine flow battery (TBFB) featuring very low operation cost and outstanding stability is reported. In this battery, a novel complexing agent, 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, is employed to stabilize bromine/polybromides and suppress Br diffusion. The results reveal that the complexing agent effectively inhibits Br crossover and reduces Br&#8208;induced corrosivity, which in turn significantly improves the reliability of the TBFB system. The novel TBFB demonstrates 95% coulombic efficiency and 83% energy efficiency at 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density. Moreover, it can run smoothly for more than 1000 cycles without any capacity decay. Furthermore, an assembled 300 W TBFB stack can be continuously operated for more than 500 cycles, thereby confirming the practical applicability of the proposed TBFB. Because the TBFB utilizes an ultralow&#8208;cost electrolyte (41.29&#160;$&#160;kWh&#8722;1) and porous polyolefin membranes, it serves as a reliable and low&#8208;cost energy&#8208;storage device. Therefore, considering its ultrahigh stability and low cost, the TBFB can be used as a large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage device.

         <title>The Role of Demixing and Crystallization Kinetics on the Stability of Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through investigation of the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor crystallization, the importance of diffusion coefficients and melting enthalpies in controlling the crystal growth rates is demonstrated, and it is revealed and that differences in halogenation can drastically change crystallization kinetics and device stability.








Abstract
With power conversion efficiency now over 17%, a long operational lifetime is essential for the successful application of organic solar cells. However, most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can crystallize and destroy devices, yet the fundamental underlying thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of acceptor crystallization have received limited attention. Here, room&#8208;temperature (RT) diffusion coefficients of 3.4 &#215; 10&#8722;23 and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;22 are measured for ITIC&#8208;2Cl and ITIC&#8208;2F, two state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. The low coefficients are enough to provide for kinetic stabilization of the morphology against demixing at RT. Additionally profound differences in crystallization characteristics are discovered between ITIC&#8208;2F and ITIC&#8208;2Cl. The differences as observed by secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and microscopy can be related directly to device degradation and are attributed to the significantly different nucleation and growth rates, with a difference in the growth rate of a factor of 12 at RT. ITIC&#8208;4F and ITIC&#8208;4Cl exhibit similar characteristics. The results reveal the importance of diffusion coefficients and melting enthalpies in controlling the growth rates, and that differences in halogenation can drastically change crystallization kinetics and device stability. It is furthermore delineated how low nucleation density and large growth rates can be inferred from DSC and microscopy experiments which could be used to guide molecular design for stability.

         <title>Discovering Electron&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Driven Changes in Chemical Bonding in Lead Chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S, O)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic changes of chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X&#160;= Te, Se, S, O) are studied to comprehend their properties. The exploration reveals an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X&#160;=&#160;Te,&#160;Se,&#160;S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO. The insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.








Abstract
Understanding the nature of chemical bonding in solids is crucial to comprehend the physical and chemical properties of a given compound. To explore changes in chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X&#160;= Te, Se, S, O), a combination of property&#8208;, bond&#8208;breaking&#8208;, and quantum&#8208;mechanical bonding descriptors are applied. The outcome of the explorations reveals an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X = Te, Se, S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO. Metavalent bonding is characterized by adjacent atoms being held together by sharing about a single electron (ES &#8776; 1) and small electron transfer (ET). The transition from metavalent to iono&#8208;covalent bonding manifests itself in clear changes in these quantum&#8208;mechanical descriptors (ES and ET), as well as in property&#8208;based descriptors (i.e., Born effective charge (Z*), dielectric function &#949;(&#969;), effective coordination number (ECoN), and mode&#8208;specific Gr&#252;neisen parameter (&#947;TO)), and in bond&#8208;breaking descriptors. Metavalent bonding collapses if significant charge localization occurs at the ion cores (ET) and/or in the interatomic region (ES). Predominantly changing the degree of electron transfer opens possibilities to tailor material properties such as the chemical bond (Z*) and electronic (&#949;&#8734;) polarizability, optical bandgap, and optical interband transitions characterized by &#949;2(&#969;). Hence, the insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.

         <title>100 m Long Thermally Drawn Supercapacitor Fibers with Applications to 3D Printing and Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flow&#8208;based preform&#8208;to&#8208;fiber (top&#8208;down) thermal drawing process is used in which a preform of macroscale dimensions, assembled with all the five component materials, is thermally drawn into 100 m lengths of fully functional supercapacitor fiber. The cell architecture is designed to address the mechanical, environmental, electrical, and storage requirements of a textile and 3D printed energy&#8208;storage device.








Abstract
Supercapacitor fibers, with short charging times, long cycle lifespans, and high power densities, hold promise for powering flexible fabric&#8208;based electronics. To date, however, only short lengths of functioning fiber supercapacitors have been produced. The primary goal of this study is to introduce a supercapacitor fiber that addresses the remaining challenges of scalability, flexibility, cladding impermeability, and performance at length. This is achieved through a top&#8208;down fabrication method in which a macroscale preform is thermally drawn into a fully functional energy&#8208;storage fiber. The preform consists of five components: thermally reversible porous electrode and electrolyte gels; conductive polymer and copper microwire current collectors; and an encapsulating hermetic cladding. This process produces 100 m of continuous functional supercapacitor fiber, orders of magnitude longer than any previously reported. In addition to flexibility (5 mm radius of curvature), moisture resistance (100 washing cycles), and strength (68&#160;MPa), these fibers have an energy density of 306 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 at 3.0&#160;V and &#8776;100% capacitance retention over 13&#160;000 cycles at 1.6&#160;V. To demonstrate the utility of this fiber, it is machine&#8208;woven and used as filament for 3D printing.

&lt;p&gt;A flow&#8208;based preform&#8208;to&#8208;fiber (top&#8208;down) thermal drawing process is used in which a preform of macroscale dimensions, assembled with all the five component materials, is thermally drawn into 100 m lengths of fully functional supercapacitor fiber. The cell architecture is designed to address the mechanical, environmental, electrical, and storage requirements of a textile and 3D printed energy&#8208;storage device.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supercapacitor fibers, with short charging times, long cycle lifespans, and high power densities, hold promise for powering flexible fabric&#8208;based electronics. To date, however, only short lengths of functioning fiber supercapacitors have been produced. The primary goal of this study is to introduce a supercapacitor fiber that addresses the remaining challenges of scalability, flexibility, cladding impermeability, and performance at length. This is achieved through a top&#8208;down fabrication method in which a macroscale preform is thermally drawn into a fully functional energy&#8208;storage fiber. The preform consists of five components: thermally reversible porous electrode and electrolyte gels; conductive polymer and copper microwire current collectors; and an encapsulating hermetic cladding. This process produces 100 m of continuous functional supercapacitor fiber, orders of magnitude longer than any previously reported. In addition to flexibility (5 mm radius of curvature), moisture resistance (100 washing cycles), and strength (68&#160;MPa), these fibers have an energy density of 306 &#956;Wh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 3.0&#160;V and &#8776;100% capacitance retention over 13&#160;000 cycles at 1.6&#160;V. To demonstrate the utility of this fiber, it is machine&#8208;woven and used as filament for 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reversibly Transforming a Highly Swollen Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel to an Extremely Tough One and its Application as a Tubular Grasper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible transformation of polyelectrolyte hydrogels between swollen, weak states and collapsed, tough states is realized by formation and breaking up of robust metal&#8208;coordination complexes. The dramatic variations of the gels&#8217; volume and mechanical properties over 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude enable the design of a hydrogel&#8208;based tubular grasper with high holding force, i.e., thousand times its own weight, to grip objects with different geometries.








Abstract
Poly(2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid) and its copolymer hydrogels are typical polyelectrolyte gels with extremely high swelling capacity that are widely used in industry. It's common to consider these hydrogels as weak materials that are difficult to toughen. Reported here is a facile strategy to transform swollen and weak poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid) [P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS)] hydrogels to tough ones by forming strong sulfonate&#8211;Zr4+ metal&#8208;coordination complexes. The resultant hydrogels with moderate water content possess high stiffness, strength, and fracture energy, which can be tuned over 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude by controlling the composition and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio. Owing to the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, these hydrogels show rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent mechanical performances, as well as good self&#8208;recovery properties. This strategy is universal, as manifested by the drastically improved mechanical properties of hydrogels of various natural and synthetic sulfonate&#8208;containing polymers. The toughened hydrogels can be converted to the original swollen ones by breaking up the metal&#8208;coordination complexes in alkaline solutions. The reversible brittle&#8211;tough transition and concomitant dramatic volume change of polyelectrolyte hydrogels afford diverse applications, as demonstrated by the design of a tubular grasper with holding force a thousand times its own weight for objects with different geometries. It is envisioned that these hydrogels enable versatile applications in the biomedical and engineering fields.

         <title>Structural Insight in the Interfacial Effect in Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using atomic force microscopy&#8211;infrared spectroscopy together with first&#8208;principles calculations and phase field simulations, a spatial structure analysis of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites is provided. The unprecedented insights into the interfacial coupling effect at the molecular level would enable interfacial engineering strategies to realize improved properties and unlock new functionalities of the nanocomposites.








Abstract
Both experimental results and theoretical models suggest the decisive role of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces on the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and electrocaloric properties of ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites. However, there remains a lack of direct structural evidence to support the so&#8208;called interfacial effect in dielectric nanocomposites. Here, a chemical mapping of the interfacial coupling between the nanofiller and the polymer matrix in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites by combining atomic force microscopy&#8211;infrared spectroscopy (AFM&#8211;IR) with first&#8208;principles calculations and phase&#8208;field simulations is provided. The addition of ceramic fillers into a ferroelectric polymer leads to augmentation of the local conformational disorder in the vicinity of the interface, resulting in the local stabilization of the all&#8208;trans conformation (i.e., the polar &#946; phase). The formation of highly polar and inhomogeneous interfacial regions, which is further enhanced with a decrease of the filler size, has been identified experimentally and verified by phase&#8208;field simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work offers unprecedented structural insights into the configurational disorder&#8208;induced interfacial effect and will enable rational design and molecular engineering of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces of electroactive polymer nanocomposites to boost their collective properties.

         <title>Improvement of Electrical Conductivity in Conjugated Polymers through Cascade Doping with Small&#8208;Molecular Dopants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An outstanding electrical conductivity (&gt;610 S cm&#8722;1) is achieved through the optimization of a devised doping strategy with conjugated polymers (CPs), which contain electron&#8208;donating S and N atoms together in the conjugated skeleton. The cascade doping approach is expected to be readily applicable to many useful CP developments for outperforming organic conductors.








Abstract
Doping capability is primitively governed by the energy level offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of conjugated polymers (CPs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of dopants. A poor doping efficiency is obtained when doping directly using NOBF4 forming a large energy offset with the CP, while the devised doping strategy is found to significantly improve the doping efficiency (electrical conductivity) by sequentially treating the NOBF4 to the pre&#8208;doped CP with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquino&#8208;dimethane (F4TCNQ), establishing a relatively small energy level offset. It is verified that the cascade doping strategy requires receptive sites for each dopant to further improve the doping efficiency, and provides fast reaction kinetics energetically. An outstanding electrical conductivity (&gt;610 S cm&#8722;1) is achieved through the optimization of the devised doping strategy, and spectroscopy analysis, including Hall effect measurement, supports more efficient charge carrier generation via the devised cascade doping.

         <title>Visualizing Tailored Spin Phenomena in a Reduced&#8208;Dimensional Topological Superlattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological states with tailored spin phenomena are realized in a reduced&#8208;dimensional superlattice structure, (&#9633;/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N or Bi2/Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N (N is the repeating unit) by controlling different terminations via molecular beam epitaxy. This work suggests a promising route of engineering topological superlattices for efficient spin&#8211;charge transducers and long&#8208;lived spin transport spintronic applications.








Abstract
Emergent topological insulators (TIs) and their design are in high demand for manipulating and transmitting spin information toward ultralow&#8208;power&#8208;consumption spintronic applications. Here, distinct topological states with tailored spin properties can be achieved in a single reduced&#8208;dimensional TI&#8208;superlattice, (Bi2/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N or (&#9633;/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N (N is the repeating unit, &#9633; represents an empty layer) by controlling the termination via molecular beam epitaxy. The Bi2&#8208;terminated superlattice exhibits a single Dirac cone with a spin momentum splitting &#8776;0.5 &#197;&#8722;1, producing a pronounced inverse Edelstein effect with a coherence length up to 1.26&#160;nm. In contrast, the Bi2Se3&#8208;terminated superlattice is identified as a dual TI protected by coexisting time reversal and mirror symmetries, showing an unexpectedly long spin lifetime up to 1&#160;ns. The work elucidates the key role of dimensionality and dual topological phases in selecting desired spin properties, suggesting a promise route for engineering topological superlattices for high&#8208;performance TI&#8208;spintronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Emergent topological insulators (TIs) and their design are in high demand for manipulating and transmitting spin information toward ultralow&#8208;power&#8208;consumption spintronic applications. Here, distinct topological states with tailored spin properties can be achieved in a single reduced&#8208;dimensional TI&#8208;superlattice, (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;(Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; or (&#9633;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;(Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; is the repeating unit, &#9633; represents an empty layer) by controlling the termination via molecular beam epitaxy. The Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;terminated superlattice exhibits a single Dirac cone with a spin momentum splitting &#8776;0.5 &#197;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, producing a pronounced inverse Edelstein effect with a coherence length up to 1.26&#160;nm. In contrast, the Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;terminated superlattice is identified as a dual TI protected by coexisting time reversal and mirror symmetries, showing an unexpectedly long spin lifetime up to 1&#160;ns. The work elucidates the key role of dimensionality and dual topological phases in selecting desired spin properties, suggesting a promise route for engineering topological superlattices for high&#8208;performance TI&#8208;spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Breakdown of the Small&#8208;Polaron Hopping Model in Higher&#8208;Order Spinels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small&#8208;polaron hopping model was developed six decades ago to rationalize electronic charge transport in oxides. The limitations of the old model are highlighted in this work and a new model that includes percolation, cross&#8208;hopping, and polaron distribution parameters in the nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping equation is presented. The new accurate model opens new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance devices such as batteries and supercapacitors.








Abstract
The small&#8208;polaron hopping model has been used for six decades to rationalize electronic charge transport in oxides. The model was developed for binary oxides, and, despite its significance, its accuracy has not been rigorously tested for higher&#8208;order oxides. Here, the small&#8208;polaron transport model is tested by using a spinel system with mixed cation oxidation states (MnxFe3&#8722;xO4). Using molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy (MBE), a series of single crystal MnxFe3&#8722;xO4 thin films with controlled stoichiometry, 0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 2.3, and lattice strain are grown, and the cation site&#8208;occupation is determined through X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Density functional theory + U analysis shows that charge transport occurs only between like&#8208;cations (Fe/Fe or Mn/Mn). The site&#8208;occupation data and percolation models show that there are limited stoichiometric ranges for transport along Fe and Mn pathways. Furthermore, due to asymmetric hopping barriers and formation energies, the MnOh2+ polaron is energetically preferred to the FeOh2+ polaron, resulting in an asymmetric contribution of Mn/Mn pathways. All of these findings are not contained in the conventional small&#8208;polaron hopping model, highlighting its inadequacy. To correct the model, new parameters in the nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping equation are introduced to account for percolation, cross&#8208;hopping, and polaron&#8208;distribution, and it is found that a near&#8208;perfect correlation can be made between experiment and theory for the electronic conductivity.

         <title>Spontaneously Splitting Copper Nanowires into Quantum Dots on Graphdiyne for Suppressing Lithium Dendrites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of copper (Cu) impacts the growth of graphdiyne. As&#8208;grown graphdiyne splits Cu into quantum dots. Cu quantum dots on graphdiyne have high lithiophilicity to suppress lithium dendrites. This one&#8208;step method to produce Cu quantum dots on all&#8208;carbon graphdiyne can be used to develop many new&#8208;concept and high&#8208;activity catalysts for sustainable technologies.








Abstract
As an emerging carbon allotrope, the controllable growth of graphdiyne has been an important means to explore its unique scientific properties and applications. In this work, the effect of the crystal structure of copper (Cu) on the growth of graphdiyne is systematically studied. It is found that the crystal boundaries are the origin of the reaction activity. The polycrystalline Cu nanowire with many crystal boundaries is spontaneously split into Cu quantum dots (about 3&#160;nm) by the grown graphdiyne. These Cu quantum dots are uniformly dispersed on the graphdiyne, and they block the long&#8208;range ordered growth of the graphdiyne. These Cu quantum dots in situ supported on graphdiyne demonstrate high efficiency in inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites in lithium metal batteries. Based on this interesting finding, the Cu quantum dots anchored on the all&#8208;carbon graphdiyne can be prepared on a large scale, and unique applications of Cu quantum dots in electrochemical fields can be implemented.

         <title>Coloring Afterglow Nanoparticles for High&#8208;Contrast Time&#8208;Gating&#8208;Free Multiplex Luminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor afterglow nanoparticles (AGNPs) are synthesized via a straightforward template method. Such multicolor AGNPs exhibit a series of tunable afterglow emissions, including blue, yellow, green, and white. They can perform as a novel optical toolbox for high&#8208;contrast multichannel afterglow imaging in vitro and in vivo without the use of any complicated time&#8208;gating algorithms or systems.








Abstract
Afterglow nanoparticles (AGNPs) possessing inherently long lifetime with tailorable emission colors and uniform size have long been sought due to their time&#8208;gating&#8208;free high&#8208;contrast multiplexing imaging. Herein, via a straightforward template method, it is reported that such multicolor AGNPs can be accomplished. The resultant AGNPs exhibit a series of tunable afterglow emissions, including blue, yellow, green, and white. These multicolor AGNPs are found to be highly bright, enabling them to perform high&#8208;contrast multichannel afterglow imaging in vitro and in vivo without the use of any complicated time&#8208;gating algorithms or systems, which existing tools are unable to do.

         <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Molecular Packing Explain Performance and Processing Procedures of Three D18:NFA Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular packing and thermodynamic properties of D18&#8208;based fullerene&#8208;free organic solar cells are studied. The D18 polymer exhibits strong chain extension in films, which is beneficial to charge transport. Miscibility and other characterizations explain the disparate performance of three systems and the processing procedures.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18:Y6 have recently exhibited a record power conversion efficiency of over 18%. The initial work is extended and the device performance of D18&#8208;based OSCs is compared with three non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, Y6, IT&#8208;4F, and IEICO&#8208;4Cl, and their molecular packing characteristics and miscibility are studied. The D18 polymer shows unusually strong chain extension and excellent backbone ordering in all films, which likely contributes to the excellent hole&#8208;transporting properties. Thermodynamic characterization indicates a room&#8208;temperature miscibility for D18:Y6 and D18:IT&#8208;4F near the percolation threshold. This corresponds to an ideal quench depth and explains the use of solvent vapor annealing rather than thermal annealing. In contrast, D18:IEICO&#8208;4Cl is a low&#8208;miscibility system with a deep quench depth during casting and poor morphology control and low performance. A failure of ternary blends with PC71BM is likely due to the near&#8208;ideal miscibility of Y6 to begin with and indicates that strategies for developing successful ternary or quaternary solar cells are likely very different for D18 than for other high&#8208;performing donors. This work reveals several unique property&#8211;performance relations of D18&#8208;based photovoltaic devices and helps guide design or fabrication of yet higher efficiency OSCs.

         <title>Designing Advanced In Situ Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Wide Temperature Operation of 4.5 V Li||LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 cathodes are highly desirable for various energy&#8208;storage applications, especially when coupled with lithium metal anodes. Fluorine&#8208;rich electrode/electrolyte interphases in situ formed in an advanced ether electrolyte are found to enable highly stable cell cycling under elevated temperatures. Such interphases effectively suppress electrolyte side reactions and preserve the integrity of both cathode and anode materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with a LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode are of significant importance to the energy&#8208;storage market, especially for portable electronics. However, their development is greatly limited by the inferior performance under high voltages and challenging temperatures. Here, highly stable lithium (Li) metal batteries with LCO cathode, through the design of in situ formed, stable electrode/electrolyte interphases on both the Li anode and the LCO cathode, with an advanced electrolyte, are reported. The LCO cathode can deliver a high specific capacity of &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1 and show greatly improved cell performances under a high charge voltage of 4.5&#160;V (even up to 4.55&#160;V) and a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 55&#160;&#176;C. This work points out a promising approach for developing Li||LCO batteries for practical applications. This approach can also be used to improve the high&#8208;voltage performance of other batteries in a broad temperature range.

In article number 2005533, Matthias Wuttig and co&#8208;workers study systematic changes of chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S, O) to comprehend their properties. They discover an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from highly anharmonic, metavalent bonding in thermoelectric PbX (X = Te, Se, S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO, highlighting the relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding for materials design.

Akin to &#8220;luminous pearls&#8221; in ancient Chinese tales of legend, afterglow nanoparticles display unusual extremely long&#8208;life&#8208;time luminescence properties after the cessation of excitation. In article number 2003881, Zhanjun Li, Gang Han, and co&#8208;workers report multicolor afterglow &#8220;luminous pearls&#8221; with tailorable emission colors and uniform size. High&#8208;contrast multichannel afterglow imaging can be readily accomplished without the current need of a time&#8208;gating system.

         <title>Polymer Films: Improvement of Electrical Conductivity in Conjugated Polymers through Cascade Doping with Small&#8208;Molecular Dopants (Adv. Mater. 49/2020)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular sequential doping using conjugated polymers is a promising approach to modulate or improve electrical conductivity without sacrificing the morphology of a pristine polymer film. In article number 2005129, Hyungtak Seo, Jong H. Kim, Bong&#8208;Gi Kim, and co&#8208;workers develop a cascade doping strategy that realizes excellent electrical conductivity through a separated doping process using two different dopants. The first dopant provides a kinetically favorable working environment for the second dopant, through regeneration, reengagement, and replacement during the secondary doping step.

An explorer is kayaking in uncharted territory, representing the exciting scientific pursuit of emerging metal batteries (MBs). Water is flowing smoothly over the jagged rocks, representing dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes as well as enhanced electrolyte wetting, both due to geometrical roughness. The electric eels underneath represent potassium&#8208;based energy storage, as they utilize potassium and sodium ions for electricity. In article number 2002908, Pengcheng Liu,  David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers present a route via improved electrolyte wetting toward stable potassium metal batteries with an all&#8208;aluminum current collector.

         <title>Electronic Charge Transport: Breakdown of the Small&#8208;Polaron Hopping Model in Higher&#8208;Order Spinels (Adv. Mater. 49/2020)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
For six decades, electronic charge transport in oxides has been described by the small&#8208;polaron hopping model. However, this model was developed for binary oxides only. By characterizing structure, site occupation, and transport, in article number 2004490, Maytal Caspary Toroker, Richard D. Robinson, and co&#8208;workers show  that the conventional model is inaccurate for oxides with more than two types of cation. They present an accurate model, opening new design avenues for high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts and Applications in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main aspects of the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are summarized, clarifying the challenges and opportunities for researchers. As the EMSI directly affects the electronic state of the catalysts, the deep principles underlying the reaction are considered, which is important for determining the generality among all electrocatalytic reactions and understanding the fundamental laws that SACs obey in electrocatalysis.








Abstract
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI), which acts as a bridge between theoretical electronic study and the design of heterogenous catalysts, has attracted much attention. Utilizing the interaction between the metal and the support is one of the most essential strategies to enhance electrocatalytic efficiency due to structural and synergetic promotion. To date, as the ideal model for realizing EMSI, many types of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been developed. The understanding of the electronic interaction on SACs has also been pushed to a higher level. However, systematic theories and operando experiments are seldom reported, and will be necessary to put forward and be carried out, respectively. Herein, the types, characterization, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of EMSI are comprehensively summarized and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of the EMSI on SACs are also proposed to present an overall view and reference to the later research.

Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;based enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalysts (Enz&#8208;Cats) have received considerable attention because of their optimized and enhanced catalytic performances and selectivities in diverse physiological environments compared with natural enzymes. Recently, owing to their molecular/atomic&#8208;level catalytic centers, high porosity, large surface area, high loading capacity, and homogeneous structure, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as one of the most promising materials in engineering Enz&#8208;Cats. Here, the recent advances in the design of MOF&#8208;engineered Enz&#8208;Cats, including their preparation methods, composite constructions, structural characterizations, and biomedical applications, are highlighted and commented upon. In particular, the performance, selectivities, essential mechanisms, and potential structure&#8211;property relations of these MOF&#8208;engineered Enz&#8208;Cats in accelerating catalytic reactions are discussed. Some potential biomedical applications of these MOF&#8208;engineered Enz&#8208;Cats are also breifly proposed. These applications include, for example, tumor therapies, bacterial disinfection, tissue regeneration, and biosensors. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges in emerging research frontiers are thoroughly discussed. Thereby, potential pathways and perspectives for designing future state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Enz&#8208;Cats in biomedical sciences are offered.

         <title>Nanomaterials with Supramolecular Assembly Based on AIE Luminogens for Theranostic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 49, December 10, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanotheranostics constructed from aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens via supramolecular assembly have been extensively studied during the past decades and exhibit great potential in personalized and precision medicine. This advanced strategy also facilitates the development of integrated systems combining diagnosis and therapy.








Abstract
One of the major pursuits of biomedical science is to develop advanced strategies for theranostics, which is expected to be an effective approach for achieving the transition from conventional medicine to precision medicine. Supramolecular assembly can serve as a powerful tool in the development of nanotheranostics with accurate imaging of tumors and real&#8208;time monitoring of the therapeutic process upon the incorporation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ability. AIE luminogens (AIEgens) will not only enable fluorescence imaging but will also aid in improving the efficacy of therapies. Furthermore, the fluorescent signals and therapeutic performance of these nanomaterials can be manipulated precisely owing to the reversible and stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics of the supramolecular systems. Inspired by rapid advances in this field, recent research conducted on nanotheranostics with the AIE effect based on supramolecular assembly is summarized.

     alt="Nanomaterials with Supramolecular Assembly Based on AIE Luminogens for Theranostic Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanotheranostics constructed from aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens via supramolecular assembly have been extensively studied during the past decades and exhibit great potential in personalized and precision medicine. This advanced strategy also facilitates the development of integrated systems combining diagnosis and therapy.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major pursuits of biomedical science is to develop advanced strategies for theranostics, which is expected to be an effective approach for achieving the transition from conventional medicine to precision medicine. Supramolecular assembly can serve as a powerful tool in the development of nanotheranostics with accurate imaging of tumors and real&#8208;time monitoring of the therapeutic process upon the incorporation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ability. AIE luminogens (AIEgens) will not only enable fluorescence imaging but will also aid in improving the efficacy of therapies. Furthermore, the fluorescent signals and therapeutic performance of these nanomaterials can be manipulated precisely owing to the reversible and stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics of the supramolecular systems. Inspired by rapid advances in this field, recent research conducted on nanotheranostics with the AIE effect based on supramolecular assembly is summarized. Here, three representative strategies for supramolecular nanomaterials are presented as follows: a) supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of AIEgens, b) the loading of AIEgens within nanocarriers with supramolecular assembly, and c) supramolecular macrocycle&#8208;guided assembly via host&#8211;guest interactions. Meanwhile, the diverse applications of such nanomaterials in diagnostics and therapeutics have also been discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges of this field are listed in this review.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Surface Termination of Solution&#8208;Processed CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Film Examined using Electron Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface property of perovskite is governed by the surface termination. The combination of ultraviolet photoelectron and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopies is demonstrated as a versatile technique to prove the surface termination. This method is applied to a solution&#8208;processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film to show that the surface is terminated with a layer consisting of CH3NH3 and I.








Abstract
The interfaces of a perovskite solar cell significantly influence the charge processes in the cell, which contributes to the device performance with direct implication for surface potential, electronic structure, and chemical reactivity. The properties of the interface are strongly affected by the surface termination. In this work, the combination of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopy is demonstrated, to examine the surface termination of a solution&#8208;processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. The results show that the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is terminated with a layer consisting of CH3NH3 and I. The interface energy level alignment for both occupied and unoccupied levels between CH3NH3PbI3 and C60 is also examined using UPS and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy. It turns out that an ideal energy level alignment is established for the electron collection and hole block at the perovskite and C60 interface.

         <title>Design of Local Atomic Environments in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Renewable Energy Conversions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rich variety of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates vast opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance renewable energy conversions.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) have recently attracted tremendous research interest due to their often remarkable catalytic responses, unmatched by conventional catalysts. The electrocatalytic performance of SAECs is closely related to the specific metal species and their local atomic environments, including their coordination number, the determined structure of the coordination sites, and the chemical identity of nearest and second nearest neighboring atoms. The wide range of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates virtually limitless opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of SAECs with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis. In this review, the authors first identify fundamental hurdles in electrochemical conversions and highlight the relevance of SAECs. They then critically examine the role of the local atomic structures, encompassing the first and second coordination spheres of the isolated metal atoms, on the design of high&#8208;performance SAECs. The relevance of single&#8208;atom dopants for host activation is also discussed. Insights into the correlation between local structures of SAECs and their catalytic response are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the authors summarize major challenges to be addressed in the field of SAECs and provide some perspectives in the rational construction of superior SAECs for a wide range of electrochemical conversions.

         <title>3D Interfacing between Soft Electronic Tools and Complex Biological Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft electronics enable biocompatible interfaces for physiological sensing and stimulation. However, their typical forms as 2D sheets create difficulties for integration with organs and tissues with complex 3D geometry. Recent strategies involve a transformation of soft electronic tools for building adaptive 3D interfaces with natural organs and tissues, providing advanced capabilities for biological research and therapeutic innovation.








Abstract
Recent developments in soft functional materials have created opportunities for building bioelectronic devices with tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. Their integration with the human body could enable advanced sensing and stimulation for medical diagnosis and therapies. However, most of the available soft electronics are constructed as planar sheets, which are difficult to interface with the target organs and tissues that have complex 3D structures. Here, the recent approaches are highlighted to building 3D interfaces between soft electronic tools and complex biological organs and tissues. Examples involve mesh devices for conformal contact, imaging&#8208;guided fabrication of organ&#8208;specific electronics, miniaturized probes for neurointerfaces, instrumented scaffold for tissue engineering, and many other soft 3D systems. They represent diverse routes for reconciling the interfacial mismatches between electronic tools and biological tissues. The remaining challenges include device scaling to approach the complexity of target organs, biological data acquisition and processing, 3D manufacturing techniques, etc., providing a range of opportunities for scientific research and technological innovation.

         <title>Activatable NIR&#8208;II Plasmonic Nanotheranostics for Efficient Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable NIR&#8208;II plasmonic theranostics system for accurate tumor diagnosis and effective treatment is reported. This gold nanochain structure breaks through the traditional molecular imaging window, shifting from the visible to the NIR&#8208;II region, owing to fusion between adjacent gold nanoparticles in the restricted local space triggered by the high H2O2 level in the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Precise manipulation of optical properties through the structure&#8208;evolution of plasmonic nanoparticles is of great interest in biomedical fields including bioimaging and phototherapy. However, previous success has been limited to fixed assembled structures or visible&#8211;NIR&#8208;I absorption. Here, an activatable NIR&#8208;II plasmonic theranostics system based on silica&#8208;encapsulated self&#8208;assembled gold nanochains (AuNCs@SiO2) for accurate tumor diagnosis and effective treatment is reported. This transformable chain structure breaks through the traditional molecular imaging window, whose absorption can be redshifted from the visible to the NIR&#8208;II region owing to the fusion between adjacent gold nanoparticles in the restricted local space of AuNCs@SiO2 triggered by the high H2O2 level in the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to the generation of a new string&#8208;like structure with strong NIR&#8208;II absorption, which is further confirmed by finite&#8208;difference&#8208;time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulation. With the TME&#8208;activated characteristics, AuNCs@SiO2 exhibits excellent properties for photoacoustic imaging and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 82.2% at 1064&#160;nm leading to severe cell death and remarkable tumor growth inhibition in vivo. These prominent intelligent TME&#8208;responsive features of AuNCs@SiO2 may open up a new avenue to explore optical regulated nano&#8208;platform for intelligent, accurate, and noninvasive theranostics in NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Hammett Relationship in Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Revealed through a Protein&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Inspired Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanozymes requires overcoming the composition&#8208; and site&#8208;heterogeneity limitations in nanomaterials. Inspired by natural metalloenzymes, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks is employed, and a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship is revealed, where increasing Hammett &#963;m value leads to the enhancement of the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity.








Abstract
While the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials that enable regulation of nanozyme activities are demonstrated in many systems, quantitative relationships between the nanomaterials structure and their enzymatic activities remain poorly understood, due to the heterogeneity of compositions and active sites in these nanomaterials. Here, inspired by metalloenzymes with well&#8208;defined metal&#8211;ligand coordination, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with similar coordination is employed to investigate the relationship between structure and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity.

&lt;p&gt;Studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanozymes requires overcoming the composition&#8208; and site&#8208;heterogeneity limitations in nanomaterials. Inspired by natural metalloenzymes, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks is employed, and a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship is revealed, where increasing Hammett &#963;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value leads to the enhancement of the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials that enable regulation of nanozyme activities are demonstrated in many systems, quantitative relationships between the nanomaterials structure and their enzymatic activities remain poorly understood, due to the heterogeneity of compositions and active sites in these nanomaterials. Here, inspired by metalloenzymes with well&#8208;defined metal&#8211;ligand coordination, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with similar coordination is employed to investigate the relationship between structure and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship (H&#8208;SALR) of MIL&#8208;53(Fe) (MIL = Materials of Institute Lavoisier) nanozymes, in which increasing the Hammett &#963;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value with electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands increases the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. As a result, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substituent shows a tenfold higher activity than the unsubstituted MIL&#8208;53(Fe). Furthermore, the generality of H&#8208;SALR is demonstrated for a range of substrates, one other metal (Cr), and even one other MOF type (MIL&#8208;101).

         <title>Cathodoluminescence of Ultrathin Twisted Ge1&#8211;xSnxS van der Waals Nanoribbon Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin twisted Ge1&#8211;xSnxS nanoribbons, realized via scalable vapor&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid growth over gold catalysts, provide a unique platform for probing guided excitonic waveguide modes in van der Waals semiconductors. Nanophotonic experiments using local electron&#8208;beam excitation detect the confined modes in the plane of the layered crystal and enable the measurement of key properties such as the field distribution into the adjacent cladding layers.








Abstract
Ultrathin van der Waals semiconductors have shown extraordinary optoelectronic and photonic properties. Propagating photonic modes make layered crystal waveguides attractive for photonic circuitry and for studying hybrid light&#8211;matter states. Accessing guided modes by conventional optics is challenging due to the limited spatial resolution and poor out&#8208;of&#8208;plane far&#8208;field coupling. Scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy can overcome these issues and can characterize waveguide modes down to a resolution of tens of nanometers, albeit for planar samples or nanostructures with moderate height variations. Electron microscopy provides atomic&#8208;scale localization also for more complex geometries, and recent advances have extended the accessible excitations from interband transitions to phonons. Here, bottom&#8208;up synthesized layered semiconductor (Ge1&#8211;xSnxS) nanoribbons with an axial twist and deep subwavelength thickness are demonstrated as a platform for realizing waveguide modes, and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy is introduced as a tool to characterize them. Combined experiments and simulations show the excitation of guided modes by the electron beam and their efficient detection via photons emitted in the ribbon plane, which enables the measurement of key properties such as the evanescent field into the vacuum cladding with nanometer resolution. The results identify van der Waals waveguides operating in the infrared and highlight an electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based approach for probing complex&#8208;shaped nanophotonic structures.

         <title>Multifunctional Reversible Self&#8208;Assembled Structures of Cellulose&#8208;Derived Phase&#8208;Change Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are prepared via surface esterification and further thiol&#8211;ene reaction on cellulose nanocrystals. These nanocrystals can assemble into flaky structures in the solid&#8208;state, which exhibit excellent thermoinduced imaging property, thermoinduced reversibility, and self&#8208;healing property. The multifunctional flaky structures can manipulate energy conversion, surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties, largely expanding their potential uses in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to advantageous properties attributed to well&#8208;organized structures, multifunctional materials with reversible hierarchical and highly ordered arrangement in solid&#8208;state assembled structures have drawn tremendous interest. However, such materials rarely exist. Based on the reversible phase transition of phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are presented herein, which are capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;ordered hierarchical structures. C18&#8208;UCNCs have a core&#8211;shell structure consisting of a cellulose crystalline core that retains the basic structure and a soft shell containing octadecyl chains that allow phase transition. The distinct core&#8211;shell structure and phase transition of octadecyl chains allow C18&#8208;UCNCs to self&#8208;assemble into flaky nano/microstructures. These self&#8208;assembled C18&#8208;UCNCs exhibit efficient thermal transport and light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion, and thus are promising for thermosensitive imaging. Specifically, flaky self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures with manipulable surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties are thermoreversible and show thermally induced self&#8208;healing properties. By using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals as a novel group of PCMs, reversible self&#8208;assembled multifunctional materials can be engineered. This study proposes a promising approach for constructing self&#8208;assembled hierarchical structures by using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals and thereby significantly expands the application of PCMs.

         <title>Reversible Crystal&#8211;Glass Transition in a Metal Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide perovskites are introduced into the field of semiconducting glasses through deliberate synthetic design of the hybrid structure, resulting in facile and reversible glass&#8211;crystalline switching under moderate thermal cycling. Such glasses can find prospective application in, for example, memory, computing, nonlinear optics, communication, catalysis, sensing, and batteries.








Abstract
Crystalline metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have provided unprecedented advances in interdisciplinary fields of materials, electronics, and photonics. While crystallinity offers numerous advantages, the ability to access a glassy state with distinct properties provides unique opportunities to extend the associated structure&#8211;property relationship, as well as broaden the application space for MHPs. Amorphous analogs for MHPs have so far been restricted to high pressures, limiting detailed studies and applications. Here, a 2D MHP is structurally tailored using bulky chiral organic cations to exhibit an unusual confluence of exceptionally low melting temperature (175&#160;&#176;C) and inhibited crystallization. The chiral MHP can thus be melt&#8208;quenched into a stable glassy state, otherwise inhibited in the analogous racemic MHP. Facile and reversible switching between glassy and crystalline states is demonstrated for the chiral MHP, each with distinct optoelectronic character, opening new opportunities for applications including, for example nonvolatile memory, optical communication, and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Gigantic Current Control of Coercive Field and Magnetic Memory Based on Nanometer&#8208;Thin Ferromagnetic van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substantial coercivity reduction by the current, larger at least by two orders of magnitude than those in previous reports, is found in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. It is theoretically shown to arise from an unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque, which itself is directly related to its special symmetries, large Berry curvature, and band topology. A working model of a new robust nonvolatile magnetic memory based on Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a much smaller current, is also produced.








Abstract
Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next&#8208;generation of energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase&#8208;transition temperature. Here, it is reported that, surprisingly, an in&#8208;plane current can tune the magnetic state of the nanometer&#8208;thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is a direct demonstration of the current&#8208;induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in&#8208;plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. In addition, a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of the discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current, is further demonstrated. The findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impact on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Initiated In Situ Cascade Reactions for Self&#8208;Amplified Biocatalytic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade enzyme&#8208;based drug delivery bioreactors, GOx/hemin@ZIF&#8208;8@DHA (GHZD NCs), are fabricated with augmented biocatalytic efficiency. Free radicals and self&#8208;sufficient H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment trigger irretrievable apoptosis and necrosis, which burst severe damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for activation of sequential immune responses. Moreover, GHZD NCs induce synergetic therapy with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 eliciting strong immunoreactions for inhibition of cancer metastasis.








Abstract
Biocatalytic nanomaterials have been verified to modulate the immunosuppressive state of an extensive range of solid tumors and directly induce antitumor immune response, which effectively combats the holdbacks in cancer immunotherapy. Herein, biomimetic cascade enzyme&#8208;initiated toxic&#8208;radical&#8208;generating devices (GHZD NCs) are fabricated by enveloping glucose oxidase (GOx), artificial nanozyme hemin, and sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide derived dihydroartemisinin (DHA) into zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for enhanced biocatalytic immunotherapy. The GHZD NCs exhibit amplified multienzyme&#8208;mimic (glucose oxidase, peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase) cascade reactions in artificial nanoscale proximity. Concurrently, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;stimulated labile iron&#8208;current amplifier boosts C&#8208;centered free radicals, which endows the GHZD NCs with tumor&#8208;specific and self&#8208;circulating generation ability of vicious C&#8208;centered free radicals. Irreversible free radicals (&#183;C and &#183;OH) and sustainable H2O2 from sequential catalytic processes logically and selectively elevate the oxidative stress in the tumor, which further triggers an efficient immunogenic cell death (ICD) progress. In addition, the in situ nanozyme&#8208;based immunotherapy employed for tumor suppression successfully elicits the long&#8208;lasting immunological memory effect, which hinders the growth of distant tumors and lung metastasis.

         <title>Trends in Micro&#8208;/Nanorobotics: Materials Development, Actuation, Localization, and System Integration for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and fabrication, functionalization, actuation, and tracking of individual and a swarm of micro/nanorobots are the indispensable part for achieving the biomedical applications. This review focuses on how to combine and integrate all the four aspects together and realize a biomedical therapeutic function using the micro&#8208;/nanorobotic strategy.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;/nanorobots (m&#8208;bots) have attracted significant interest due to their suitability for applications in biomedical engineering and environmental remediation. Particularly, their applications in in vivo diagnosis and intervention have been the focus of extensive research in recent years with various clinical imaging techniques being applied for localization and tracking. The successful integration of well&#8208;designed m&#8208;bots with surface functionalization, remote actuation systems, and imaging techniques becomes the crucial step toward biomedical applications, especially for the in vivo uses. This review thus addresses four different aspects of biomedical m&#8208;bots: design/fabrication, functionalization, actuation, and localization. The biomedical applications of the m&#8208;bots in diagnosis, sensing, microsurgery, targeted drug/cell delivery, thrombus ablation, and wound healing are reviewed from these viewpoints. The developed biomedical m&#8208;bot systems are comprehensively compared and evaluated based on their characteristics. The current challenges and the directions of future research in this field are summarized.

         <title>Extremely Stable Luminescent Crosslinked Perovskite Nanoparticles under Harsh Environments over 1.5 Years</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extraordinarily long stability, exceeding 1.5 years, for crosslinked perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) under harsh environments, by a novel materials design strategy, is reported. Surprisingly, the photoluminescence of the perovskite NPs is significantly increased under air, moisture, and chemicals, overcoming their instability in oxygen, water, and polar chemicals.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) are a very strong candidate emitter that can meet the high luminescence efficiency and high color standard of Rec.2020. However, the instability of perovskite NPs is the most critical unsolved problem that limits their practical application. Here, an extremely stable crosslinked perovskite NP (CPN) is reported that maintains high photoluminescence quantum yield for 1.5 years (&gt;600 d) in air and in harsher liquid environments (e.g., in water, acid, or base solutions, and in various polar solvents), and for more than 100 d under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity without additional encapsulation. Unsaturated hydrocarbons in both the acid and base ligands of NPs are chemically crosslinked with a methacrylate&#8208;functionalized matrix, which prevents decomposition of the perovskite crystals. Counterintuitively, water vapor permeating through the crosslinked matrix chemically passivates surface defects in the NPs and reduces nonradiative recombination. Green&#8208;emitting and white&#8208;emitting flexible large&#8208;area displays are demonstrated, which are stable for &gt;400 d in air and in water. The high stability of the CPN in water enables biocompatible cell proliferation which is usually impossible when toxic Pb elements are present. The stable materials design strategies provide a breakthrough toward commercialization of perovskite NPs in displays and bio&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Ultrathin Ga2O3 Glass: A Large&#8208;Scale Passivation and Protection Material for Monolayer WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D transition metal dichalcogenides have promising properties for future semiconductor technologies. Their integration into functional devices requires cost&#8208;efficient and large&#8208;scale passivation and protection against material deposition. This work introduces ultrathin Ga2O3 glass as a new, scalable capping material for monolayer WS2. It exhibits a novel passivation mechanism and offers extraordinary protection against deposition of dielectric materials, for example, for top&#8208;gating.








Abstract
Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs) have extraordinary optical properties that make them attractive for future optoelectronic applications. Integration of TMDCs into practical all&#8208;dielectric heterostructures hinges on the ability to passivate and protect them against necessary fabrication steps on large scales. Despite its limited scalability, encapsulation of TMDCs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) currently has no viable alternative for achieving high performance of the final device. Here, it is shown that the novel, ultrathin Ga2O3 glass is an ideal centimeter&#8208;scale coating material that enhances optical performance of the monolayers and protects them against further material deposition. In particular, Ga2O3 capping of monolayer WS2 outperforms commercial&#8208;grade hBN in both scalability and optical performance at room temperature. These properties make Ga2O3 highly suitable for large&#8208;scale passivation and protection of monolayer TMDCs in functional&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Poly(vinylidene difluoride)/Dopamine Core/Shell Piezoelectric Nanofiber and Its Application for Biomedical Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance poly(vinylidene difluoride)/dopamine core/shell piezoelectric nanofibers with excellent stability are successfully fabricated by one&#8208;step electrospinning in large scale and quantity, offering an extraordinary building block for developing self&#8208;powered sensor devices to detect weak absolute pressure change from soft tissues in vivo. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.








Abstract
Fabrication of soft piezoelectric nanomaterials is essential for the development of wearable and implantable biomedical devices. However, a big challenge in this soft functional material development is to achieve a high piezoelectric property with long&#8208;term stability in a biological environment. Here, a one&#8208;step strategy for fabricating core/shell poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)/dopamine (DA) nanofibers (NFs) with a very high &#946;&#8208;phase content and self&#8208;aligned polarization is reported. The self&#8208;assembled core/shell structure is believed essential for the formation and alignment of &#946;&#8208;phase PVDF, where strong intermolecular interaction between the &#63743;NH2 groups on DA and the &#63743;CF2 groups on PVDF is responsible for aligning the PVDF chains and promoting &#946;&#8208;phase nucleation. The as&#8208;received PVDF/DA NFs exhibit significantly enhanced piezoelectric performance and excellent stability and biocompatibility. An all&#8208;fiber&#8208;based soft sensor is fabricated and tested on human skin and in vivo in mice. The devices show a high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting weak physiological mechanical stimulation from diaphragm motions and blood pulsation. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrication of soft piezoelectric nanomaterials is essential for the development of wearable and implantable biomedical devices. However, a big challenge in this soft functional material development is to achieve a high piezoelectric property with long&#8208;term stability in a biological environment. Here, a one&#8208;step strategy for fabricating core/shell poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)/dopamine (DA) nanofibers (NFs) with a very high &#946;&#8208;phase content and self&#8208;aligned polarization is reported. The self&#8208;assembled core/shell structure is believed essential for the formation and alignment of &#946;&#8208;phase PVDF, where strong intermolecular interaction between the &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups on DA and the &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups on PVDF is responsible for aligning the PVDF chains and promoting &#946;&#8208;phase nucleation. The as&#8208;received PVDF/DA NFs exhibit significantly enhanced piezoelectric performance and excellent stability and biocompatibility. An all&#8208;fiber&#8208;based soft sensor is fabricated and tested on human skin and in vivo in mice. The devices show a high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting weak physiological mechanical stimulation from diaphragm motions and blood pulsation. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Finding the Next Superhard Material through Ensemble Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method capable of finding new superhard materials is constructed by directly predicting the experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on chemical composition. The model is then used to conduct high&#8208;throughput screening of crystal databases and machine&#8208;learning generated phase diagrams to suggest undiscovered superhard materials.








Abstract
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method is demonstrated to be capable of finding superhard materials by directly predicting the load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on the chemical composition. A total of 1062 experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness data are extracted from the literature and used to train a supervised machine&#8208;learning algorithm utilizing boosting, achieving excellent accuracy (R2&#160;= 0.97). This new model is then tested by synthesizing and measuring the load&#8208;dependent hardness of several unreported disilicides and analyzing the predicted hardness of several classic superhard materials. The trained ensemble method is then employed to screen for superhard materials by examining more than 66&#8201;000 compounds in crystal structure databases, which show that 68 known materials have a Vickers hardness &#8805;40 GPa at 0.5 N (applied force) and only 10 exceed this mark at 5 N. The hardness model is then combined with the data&#8208;driven phase diagram generation tool to expand the limited number of reported high hardness compounds. Eleven ternary borocarbide phase spaces are studied, and more than ten thermodynamically favorable compositions with a hardness above 40 GPa (at 0.5 N) are identified, proving this ensemble model's ability to find previously unknown materials with outstanding mechanical&#160;properties.

         <title>Covalent Graphene&#8208;MOF Hybrids for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for the preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF hybrids with an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework and carboxylate functionalized graphene via amide bonds for capacitance applications is demonstrated.








Abstract
In this work, the covalent attachment of an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;= Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc&#8208;NH2)6; bdc&#8208;NH2&#160;= 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) (UiO&#8208;Universitetet i Oslo) to the basal&#8208;plane of carboxylate functionalized graphene (graphene acid = GA) via amide bonds is reported. The resultant GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 hybrid displayed a large specific surface area, hierarchical pores and an interconnected conductive network. The electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the hybrid GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 acts as an effective charge storing material with a capacitance of up to 651 F g&#8722;1, significantly higher than traditional graphene&#8208;based materials. The results suggest that the amide linkage plays a key role in the formation of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, which facilitates charge transfer and consequently offers good capacitance and cycling stability. Furthermore, to realize the practical feasibility, an asymmetric supercapacitor using a GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 positive electrode with Ti3C2TX MXene as the opposing electrode has been constructed. The cell is able to deliver a power density of up to 16&#160;kW kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of up to 73&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which are comparable to several commercial devices such as Pb&#8208;acid and Ni/MH batteries. Under an intermediate level of loading, the device retained 88% of its initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles.

         <title>Alloyed Palladium&#8211;Silver Nanowires Enabling Ultrastable Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloyed Pd&#8211;Ag nanowires exhibit significantly improved stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate at potentials where people previously believed that the product could not be stably formed on Pd. This is due to the markedly enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires.








Abstract
Palladium can enable the electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with nearly zero overpotential and good selectivity. However, it usually has very limited stability owing to CO poisoning from the side reaction intermediate. Herein, it is demonstrated that alloying palladium with silver is a viable strategy to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic stability. Palladium&#8211;silver alloy nanowires are prepared in aqueous solution with tunable chemical compositions, large aspect ratio, and roughened surfaces. Thanks to the unique synergy between palladium and silver, these nanowires exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performances for selective formate production. Most remarkably, impressive long&#8208;term stability is measured even at &lt;&#8201;&#8208;0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode where people previously believed that formate cannot be stably formed on palladium. Such stability results from the enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires as supported by detailed electrochemical characterizations and theoretical computations.

         <title>Continuous High&#8208;Throughput Fabrication of Architected Micromaterials via In&#8208;Air Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;air polymerization of a liquid jet is presented as a novel platform to produce tunable micromaterials at flow rates &gt;1 mL min&#8208;1 per nozzle. A library of microparticles with tunable size, shape, morphology, and chemistry is presented. Stimuli&#8208;responsive Janus fiber with tunable composition and printed microlens arrays with controllable three&#8208;dimensional curvatures are demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent advances in optical coding, drug delivery, diagnostics, tissue engineering, shear&#8208;induced gelation, and functionally engineered rheology crucially depend on microparticles and microfibers with tunable shape, size, and composition. However, scalable manufacturing of the required complex micromaterials remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here in&#8208;air polymerization of liquid jets is demonstrated as a novel platform to produce microparticles and microfibers with tunable size, shape, and composition at high throughput (&gt;100&#160;mL h&#8722;1 per nozzle). The polymerization kinetics is quantitatively investigated and modeled as a function of the ink composition, the UV light intensity, and the velocity of the liquid jet, enabling engineering of complex micromaterials in jetting regimes. The size, morphology, and local chemistry of micromaterials are independently controlled, as highlighted by producing micromaterials using 5 different photopolymers as well as multi&#8208;material composites. Simultaneous optimization of these control parameters yields rapid fabrication of stimuli&#8208;responsive Janus fibers that function as soft actuators. Finally, in&#8208;air photopolymerization enables control over the curvature of printed droplets, as highlighted by high&#8208;throughput printing of microlenses with tunable focal distance. The combination of rapid processing and tunability in composition and architecture opens a new route toward applications of tailored micromaterials in soft matter, medicine, pharmacy, and optics.

High&#8208;performance voltage&#8208;dependent color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a single Pt[O^N^C^N] emitter are fabricated. The emission color can be tuned from warm white to nature white or from orange to yellowish green, depending upon the emitter used. High external quantum efficiency (23.23%), low efficiency roll&#8208;off, long&#8208;term stability (LT90&#160;= 19&#160;105 h) and continuously variable color enable these color&#8208;tunable OLEDs to find applications in smart wearable devices.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;dependent, color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are appealing tools that can be used for the visualization of electronic output signal of sensors. Nonetheless, the literature&#8208;reported color&#8208;tunable OLEDs that have a simple single&#8208;cell device structure suffer from relatively low efficiency, pronounced efficiency roll&#8208;off, color&#8208;aging, and short operation lifetime, all of which limit their practical applications. Here, a novel co&#8208;host&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer (CHIDEL) device, designed to enhance the performance of color&#8208;tunable OLEDs with the use of a single tetradentate Pt[O^N^C^N] emitter, is described. When Pt&#8208;X&#8208;2 is used as a single emitter in an optimized CHIDEL device, a white OLED with tunable Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates from (0.47, 0.44) at 3&#160;V to (0.36, 0.48) at 11&#160;V, a high color rendering index of 82, and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20.75% can be achieved. By using Pt&#8208;X&#8208;4 as a single emitter, the voltage&#8208;dependent color&#8208;tunable CHIDEL device, with CIE coordinates shifted from (0.56, 0.43) at 3&#160;V to (0.42, 0.55) at 11&#160;V, demonstrates a high luminance of beyond 90 000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a high EQE of 23.23% at a luminance of 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2. A long&#8208;lifetime time to 90% of the initial luminance (LT90) of almost 20&#160;000 h is demonstrated for the color&#8208;tunable OLED with Pt&#8208;X&#8208;4 emitting dopant.

         <title>Turning On Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by Phototriggered Subtle Molecular Conformation Variations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state intelligent materials, in particular those showing photoresponsive luminescence (PRL), is desirable for their cutting&#8208;edge applications but challenging. A PRL material that features sensitive and reversible fluorescence switching through phototriggering and thermal annealing is reported.

Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state intelligent materials, in particular those showing photoresponsive luminescence (PRL), is highly desirable for their cutting&#8208;edge applications in sensors, displays, data&#8208;storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, but is challenging. Few PRL materials are constructed by tethering the classic photochromic systems with newly&#8208;emerged solid&#8208;state emitters. Selective solid&#8208;state photoreactions are demanded to precisely manipulate the luminescent behavior of these emitters, which require dramatic structural change and enough free space, thus limiting the scope of the PRL family. Here, a new PRL material, TPE&#8208;4N, that features sensitive and reversible fluorescence switching is reported. The interesting on&#8211;off luminescent property of TPE&#8208;4N can be facilely tuned through fast phototriggering and thermal annealing. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that subtle molecular conformation variation induces the corresponding PRL behavior. The crystalline and amorphous state endows an efficient and weak ISC process, respectively, to turn on and off the emission. The readily fabricated thin&#8208;film of TPE&#8208;4N exhibits non&#8208;destructive PRL behavior with high contrast (&gt;102), good light transmittance (&gt;72.3%), and great durability and reversibility under room light for months. Remarkably, a uniform thin&#8208;film with such fascinating PRL properties allows high&#8208;tech applications in invisible anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic optical data storage with micro&#8208;resolution.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Modulated Supramolecular Assembly Increases Antitumor Potency against Malignant Breast Tumors via Tunable Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles (IBMs), via the interplay of both &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions, are reported. These IBMs cause efficient cascade delivery into cytoplasm and tunable photoconversion for yielding potent antitumor synergy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer together with distinctly reduced recurrence and metastasis through the reversal of tumor immunosuppression.








Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains with highest incidence and mortality rates among females, and a critical bottleneck lies in rationally establishing potent therapeutics against TNBC. Here, the self&#8208;assembled micellar nanoarchitecture of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;modulated supramolecules with efficient cytoplasmic translocation and tunable photoconversion is shown, for potent suppression against primary, metastatic, and recurrent TNBC. Multi&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles yield tunable photoconversion into singlet oxygen and a thermal effect, together with deep penetration and subsequent cytoplasmic translocation at the tumor. Tetra&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles (4&#8208;IBMs) particularly show a distinctly enhanced cooperativity of antitumor efficiency through considerable expressions of apoptotic proteins, potently suppressing subcutaneous, and orthotopic TNBC models, together with reduced oxygen dependence. Furthermore, 4&#8208;IBMs yield preferable anti&#8208;metastatic and anti&#8208;recurrent efficacies through the inhibition of metastasis&#8208;relevant proteins, distinct immunogenic cell death, and re&#8208;education of M2 macrophages into tumoricidal M1 phenotype as compared to chemotherapy and surgical resection. These results offer insights into the cooperativity of supramolecular nanoarchitectures for potent phototherapy against TNBC.

         <title>Stabilizing Anionic Redox Chemistry in a Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathode Constructed by Li&#8208;Deficient Pristine State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O3&#8208;type Li0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2 is successfully developed, with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are of significant interest for coupling anionic redox with cationic redox chemistry to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, lattice oxygen loss and derived structure distortion would induce serious capacity loss and voltage decay, further hindering its practical application. Herein, a novel Li&#8208;rich cathode material, O3&#8208;type Li0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2, is developed with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, not only can high reversible capacity (&#8776;329 mAh g&#8722;1) be harvested but also irreversible/reversible anionic/cationic redox reactions are comprehensively assigned via the combination of in/ex situ spectroscopies. Furthermore, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained, resulting in long&#8208;term cycle stability (capacity drop of 0.045% per cycle, 500 cycles). Altogether, tuning the Li state in the alkali metal layer presents a promising way for modification of high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich cathode candidates.

         <title>Performance Limits of an Alternating Current Electroluminescent Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroluminescence can be achieved from nearly any emissive material with a single, generic device structure that uses alternating current voltage and a carbon nanotube contact. Performance limits of the device are studied through device modeling and experiments, demonstrating how low voltage and efficient electroluminescence can be achieved with emissive materials possessing a wide range of electrical and physical properties.








Abstract
The use of an alternating current (AC) voltage is a simple, versatile method of producing electroluminescence from generic emissive materials without the need for contact engineering. Recently, it was shown that AC&#8208;driven, capacitive electroluminescent devices with carbon nanotube network contacts can be used to generate and study electroluminescence from a variety of molecular materials emitting in the infrared&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet range.

     alt="Performance Limits of an Alternating Current Electroluminescent Device"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroluminescence can be achieved from nearly any emissive material with a single, generic device structure that uses alternating current voltage and a carbon nanotube contact. Performance limits of the device are studied through device modeling and experiments, demonstrating how low voltage and efficient electroluminescence can be achieved with emissive materials possessing a wide range of electrical and physical properties.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of an alternating current (AC) voltage is a simple, versatile method of producing electroluminescence from generic emissive materials without the need for contact engineering. Recently, it was shown that AC&#8208;driven, capacitive electroluminescent devices with carbon nanotube network contacts can be used to generate and study electroluminescence from a variety of molecular materials emitting in the infrared&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet range. Here, performance trade&#8208;offs in these devices are studied through comprehensive device simulations and illustrative experiments, enhancing understanding of the mechanism and capability of electroluminescent devices based on alternating as opposed to direct current (DC) schemes. AC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices can overcome several limitations of conventional DC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices, including the requirement for proper alignment of material energy levels and the need to process emitting materials into uniform thin films. By simultaneously optimizing device geometry, driving parameters, and material characteristics, the performance of these devices can be tuned. Importantly, the turn&#8208;on voltage of AC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices approaches the bandgap of the emitting material as the gate oxide thickness is scaled, and internally efficient electroluminescence can be achieved using low&#8208;mobility single&#8208;layer emitter films with varying thicknesses and energy barrier heights relative to the contact.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Operando Tailoring of Defects and Strains in Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, with outstanding activity and stability for hybrid supercapacitors, is developed through an electrochemical abuse strategy. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure technique and finite element analysis demonstrate that the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology play critical roles in enhancing chemical activity and structural robustness.








Abstract
Nickel hydroxide represents a technologically important material for energy storage, such as hybrid supercapacitors. It has two different crystallographic polymorphs, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, showing advantages in either theoretical capacity or cycling/rate performance, manifesting a trade&#8208;off trend that needs to be optimized for practical applications. Here, the synergistic superiorities in both activity and stability of corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are demonstrated through an electrochemical abuse approach. With &#8776;91% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, the corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 457 C g&#8722;1 at a high current density of 30 A g&#8722;1, which is nearly two and four times that of the regular &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, respectively. Operando spectroscopy and finite element analysis reveal that greatly enhanced chemical activity and structural robustness can be attributed to the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology. This work demonstrates a multi&#8208;scale defect&#8208;and&#8208;strain co&#8208;design strategy, which is helpful for rational design and tuned fabrication of next&#8208;generation electrode materials for stable and high&#8208;rate energy storage.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage and Tumor&#8208;Cell Dually Transfecting Polyplexes for Efficient Interleukin&#8208;12 Cancer Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intravenously administered polymeric interleukin&#8208;12 (IL12) gene&#8208;delivery vector transfects both tumor cells and macrophages to efficiently produce IL12 inside the tumor, which activates anticancer immune responses and the tumor microenvironment, leading to retarded tumor growth and prolonged animals&#8217; survival with negligible systemic toxicities. This work demonstrates the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery making use of both macrophages and tumor cells.








Abstract
Interleukin 12 (IL12) is a potent pro&#8208;inflammatory chemokine with multifunction, including promoting cytotoxic T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated killing of cancer cells. IL12&#8208;based cancer gene therapy can overcome IL12's life&#8208;threatening adverse effects, but its clinical translation has been limited by the lack of systemic gene&#8208;delivery vectors capable of efficiently transfecting tumors to produce sufficient local IL12. Macrophages inherently excrete IL12, and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major tumor component taking up a large fraction of the vectors arriving in the tumor. It is thus hypothesized that a gene vector efficiently transfecting both cancer cells and TAMs would make the tumor to produce sufficient IL12; however, gene transfection of TAMs is challenging due to their inherent strong degradation ability. Herein, an IL12 gene&#8208;delivery vector is designed that efficiently transfects both cancer cells and TAMs to make them as a factory for IL12 production, which efficiently activates anticancer immune responses and remodels the tumor microenvironment, for instance, increasing the M1/M2 ratio by more than fourfold. Therefore, the intravenously administered vector retards tumor growth and doubles survival in three animal models&#8217; with negligible systemic toxicities. This work reports the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery system that effectively makes use of both macrophages and tumor cells.

         <title>Consequences of Chirality in Directing the Pathway of Cholesteric Helix Inversion of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers by Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating copolymers of fluorene and azobenzene exhibit exceptional chiroptical properties in annealed thin films. The chiroptical properties, polymer chain alignment, and their supramolecular helicity can be fully controlled by irradiating with polarized light. Intriguingly, the diastereomeric relationship between the supramolecular helicity of polymer and the circular polarization of light leads to an asymmetric helix inversion pathway, reminiscent of molecular motors.








Abstract
Control over main&#8208;chain motion of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers can lead to unexpected new functionalities.&#160;Here, it is shown that by combining photoswitchable azobenzene units in conjugation with chiral fluorene comonomers and appropriate plasticizers, the polymer organization and chiroptical properties of these alternating copolymers steered by light and its state of polarization can be dynamically controlled. The configuration of the stereogenic centers in the side chains of the fluorene units determines the handedness of the cholesteric organization in thermally annealed films, indicating cooperative behavior. The polymer alignment and helicity of the supramolecular arrangement can be switched by irradiating with linearly and circularly polarized light, respectively.&#160;Intriguingly, when switching the handedness of thermally induced cholesteric organizations by illuminating with circularly polarized light that is opposite to the handedness of the cholesteric phases, a nematic&#8208;like intermediate state is observed during helix interconversion. By the sequence of irradiation with left and right circularly polarized light followed by thermal annealing, an asymmetric motion, reminiscent of that seen in molecular motors is observed. These findings suggest that functional conjugated polymers can exhibit emergent properties at mesoscopic scale.

         <title>Nanoscale&#8208;Confined Terahertz Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme confinement of long&#8208;wavelength terahertz radiation to nanoscale dimensions is achieved in the natural hyperbolic van der Waals crystal &#945;&#8208;MoO3. A range of highly anisotropic, in&#8208;plane THz polaritonic excitations are directly visualized in the 8&#8211;12 THz spectral range, exhibiting ultralow&#8208;loss propagation, tunable THz response, and orthogonal propagation directions.








Abstract
Electromagnetic field confinement is crucial for nanophotonic technologies, since it allows for enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions, thus enabling light manipulation in deep sub&#8208;wavelength scales. In the terahertz (THz) spectral range, radiation confinement is conventionally achieved with specially designed metallic structures&#8212;such as antennas or nanoslits&#8212;with large footprints due to the rather long wavelengths of THz radiation. In this context, phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in van der Waals (vdW) crystals have emerged as a promising solution for controlling light beyond the diffraction limit, as they feature extreme field confinements and low optical losses. However, experimental demonstration of nanoscale&#8208;confined phonon polaritons at THz frequencies has so far remained elusive. Here, it is provided by employing scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy combined with a free&#8208;electron laser to reveal a range of low&#8208;loss polaritonic excitations at frequencies from 8 to 12 THz in the vdW semiconductor &#945;&#8208;MoO3. In this study, THz polaritons are visualized with: i) in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersion, ii) extreme nanoscale field confinement (below &#955;o&#160;&#8260;75), and iii) long polariton lifetimes, with a lower limit of &gt;2&#160;ps.

         <title>Designing Mechanical Metamaterials with Kirigami&#8208;Inspired, Hierarchical Constructions for Giant Positive and Negative Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of 2D hierarchical metamaterial that incorporates kirigami&#8208;inspired bilayer actuating elements into periodic lattice patterns to allow for giant positive/negative CTEs is developed. Quantitative comparison to existing mechanical metamaterials suggests that the presented hierarchical metamaterials can substantially enlarge the accessible range of CTE in the Ashby plot, by nearly an order of magnitude for the biaxial CTE.








Abstract
Advanced mechanical metamaterials with unusual thermal expansion properties represent an area of growing interest, due to their promising potential for use in a broad range of areas. In spite of previous work on metamaterials with large or ultralow coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), achieving a broad range of CTE values with access to large thermally induced dimensional changes in structures with high filling ratios remains a key challenge. Here, design concepts and fabrication strategies for a kirigami&#8208;inspired class of 2D hierarchical metamaterials that can effectively convert the thermal mismatch between two closely packed constituent materials into giant levels of biaxial/uniaxial thermal expansion/shrinkage are presented. At large filling ratios (&gt;50%), these systems offer not only unprecedented negative and positive biaxial CTE (i.e., &#8722;5950 and 10 710&#160;ppm K&#8722;1), but also large biaxial thermal expansion properties (e.g., &gt;&#160;21% for 20 K temperature increase). Theoretical modeling of thermal deformations provides a clear understanding of the microstructure&#8211;property relationships and serves as a basis for design choices for desired CTE values. An Ashby plot of the CTE versus density serves as a quantitative comparison of the hierarchical metamaterials presented here to previously reported systems, indicating the capability for substantially enlarging the accessible range of CTE.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hyperthermia Therapy&#8208;Based Synergistic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based hyperthermia therapy (HTT) including photothermal therapy and magnetic hyperthermia can not only ablate different types of primary tumors, but also sensitize tumors to create a highly immunogenic tumor microenvironment for immunotherapy to further fight against cancer metastasis and recurrence. Hence, such HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy approach offers a powerful method for curing cancer completely.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed hyperthermia therapy (HTT) as an emerging strategy against malignant tumors. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) and magnetic hyperthermia (MHT), as highly effective and noninvasive treatment models, offer advantages over other strategies in the treatment of different types of tumors. However, both PTT and MHT cannot completely cure cancer due to recurrence and distal metastasis. In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has attracted widespread attention owing to its capability to activate the body's own natural defense to identify, attack, and eradicate cancer cells. Significant efforts have been devoted to studying the activated immune responses caused by hyperthermia&#8208;ablated tumors. In this article, the synergistic mechanism of HTT in immunotherapy, including immunogenic cell death and reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is discussed. The reports of the combination of HTT or HTT&#8208;based multimodal therapy with immunotherapy, including immunoadjuvant exploitation, immune checkpoint blockade therapy, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy are summarized. As highlighted, these strategies could achieve synergistically enhanced therapeutic outcomes against both primary tumors and metastatic lesions, prevent cancer recurrence, and prolong the survival period. Finally, current challenges and prospective developments in HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy are also reviewed.

         <title>Nanocellulose: Recent Fundamental Advances and Emerging Biological and Biomimicking Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have recently become the focal point of sustainable nanoconstruction. Beyond the classic approaches dealing with, for example, reinforced nanocomposites, barriers, films, and structural color, the fundamental interactions within nanocelluloses, multifunctional hybrid gels, multicomponent fibers, and nanocelluloses in artificial photosynthesis are reviewed.








Abstract
In the effort toward sustainable advanced functional materials, nanocelluloses have attracted extensive recent attention. Nanocelluloses range from rod&#8208;like highly crystalline cellulose nanocrystals to longer and more entangled cellulose nanofibers, earlier denoted also as microfibrillated celluloses and bacterial cellulose. In recent years, they have spurred research toward a wide range of applications, ranging from nanocomposites, viscosity modifiers, films, barrier layers, fibers, structural color, gels, aerogels and foams, and energy applications, until filtering membranes, to name a few. Still, nanocelluloses continue to show surprisingly high challenges to master their interactions and tailorability to allow well&#8208;controlled assemblies for functional materials. Rather than trying to review the already extensive nanocellulose literature at large, here selected aspects of the recent progress are the focus. Water interactions, which are central for processing for the functional properties, are discussed first. Then advanced hybrid gels toward (multi)stimuli responses, shape&#8208;memory materials, self&#8208;healing, adhesion and gluing, biological scaffolding, and forensic applications are discussed. Finally, composite fibers are discussed, as well as nanocellulose as a strategy for improvement of photosynthesis&#8208;based chemicals production. In summary, selected perspectives toward new directions for sustainable high&#8208;tech functional materials science based on nanocelluloses are described.

         <title>Identifying Ionic and Electronic Charge Transfer at Oxide Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined role of ionic and electronic charge transfer in oxide heterointerfaces (LaAlO3/SrTiO3) is investigated. New near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data proves a reversible Sr cation reconstruction under thermodynamic treatment to be responsible for lowered interface conductivity and enhanced magnetism under low temperatures. Ionic movement is found to be considerably higher and more influential than in the bulk.








Abstract
The ability to tailor oxide heterointerfaces has led to novel properties in low&#8208;dimensional oxide systems. A fundamental understanding of these properties is based on the concept of electronic charge transfer. However, the electronic properties of oxide heterointerfaces crucially depend on their ionic constitution and defect structure: ionic charges contribute to charge transfer and screening at oxide interfaces, triggering a thermodynamic balance of ionic and electronic structures. Quantitative understanding of the electronic and ionic roles regarding charge&#8208;transfer phenomena poses a central challenge. Here, the electronic and ionic structure is simultaneously investigated at the prototypical charge&#8208;transfer heterointerface, LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Applying in situ photoemission spectroscopy under oxygen ambient, ionic and electronic charge transfer is deconvoluted in response to the oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In this way, both the rich and variable chemistry of complex oxides and the associated electronic properties are equally embraced. The interfacial electron gas is depleted through an ionic rearrangement in the strontium cation sublattice when oxygen is applied, resulting in an inverse and reversible balance between cation vacancies and electrons, while the mobility of ionic species is found to be considerably enhanced as compared to the bulk. Triggered by these ionic phenomena, the electronic transport and magnetic signature of the heterointerface are significantly altered.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a straightforward polyTPD passivation is introduced to reduce the defect&#8208;mediated recombination by elucidating the imperfections on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in perovskite solar cells with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21%. Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic and thermally robust polyTPD passivated devices retain 94% of the initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions.








Abstract
The failure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to maintain their maximum efficiency over a prolonged time is due to the deterioration of the light harvesting material under environmental factors such as humidity, heat, and light. Systematically elucidating and eliminating such degradation pathways are critical to imminent commercial use of this technology. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced to reduce the level of defect&#8208;states present at the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface by treating the various perovskite surfaces with poly(N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;4&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisphenyl)benzidine (polyTPD) molecules. This strategy significantly suppresses the defect&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative recombination in the ensuing devices and prevents the penetration of degrading agents into the inner layers by passivating the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in PSCs with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21% with negligible hysteresis (&#8776;19.1% for control device). Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic polyTPD passivant considerably alleviates moisture penetration, showing &#8776;91% retention of initial efficiencies after 300 h storage at high relative humidity of 80%. Similarly, passivated device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions (maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination at 60&#160;&#176;C). In addition to interfacial passivation function, hole&#8208;selective role of dopant&#8208;free polyTPD is also evaluated and discussed in this study.

Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic polyTPD passivant considerably alleviates moisture penetration, showing &#8776;91% retention of initial efficiencies after 300 h storage at high relative humidity of 80%. Similarly, passivated device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions (maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination at 60&#160;&#176;C). In addition to interfacial passivation function, hole&#8208;selective role of dopant&#8208;free polyTPD is also evaluated and discussed in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strain&#8208;Mediated High Conductivity in Ultrathin Antiferromagnetic Metallic Nitrides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic state transitions in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films are mediated with strain and reduced dimensionality. Surprisingly, the CrN layer is still highly conductive when its thickness shrinks to 1&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.








Abstract
Strain engineering provides the ability to control the ground states and associated phase transition in epitaxial films. However, the systematic study of the intrinsic character and strain dependency in transition&#8208;metal nitrides remains challenging due to the difficulty in fabricating stoichiometric and high&#8208;quality films. Here the observation of an electronic state transition in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films with strain and reduced dimensionality is reported. By shrinking the film thickness to a critical value of &#8776;30 unit cells, a profound conductivity reduction accompanied by unexpected volume expansion is observed in CrN films. The electrical conductivity is observed surprisingly when the CrN layer is as thin as a single unit cell thick, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. It is found that the metallicity of an ultrathin CrN film recovers from insulating behavior upon the removal of the as&#8208;grown strain by the fabrication of freestanding nitride films. Both first&#8208;principles calculations and linear dichroism measurements reveal that the strain&#8208;mediated orbital splitting effectively customizes the relatively small bandgap at the Fermi level, leading to an exotic phase transition in CrN. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films by harnessing strain&#8208;control over competing phases can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.

         <title>Accelerated Development of Colloidal Nanomaterials Enabled by Modular Microfluidic Reactors: Toward Autonomous Robotic Experimentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, microfluidic technologies have increasingly been applied toward the accelerated synthesis science studies of solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, allowing greater control over synthesis conditions, lower reagent consumption, and unique data access through online monitoring techniques. Adoption of microfluidic synthesis technologies offers potential access to higher performing nanomaterials through autonomous robotic experimentation.








Abstract
In recent years, microfluidic technologies have emerged as a powerful approach for the advanced synthesis and rapid optimization of various solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, including semiconductor quantum dots and nanoplatelets, and metal plasmonic and reticular framework nanoparticles. These fluidic systems offer access to previously unattainable measurements and synthesis conditions at unparalleled efficiencies and sampling rates. Despite these advantages, microfluidic systems have yet to be extensively adopted by the colloidal nanomaterial community. To help bridge the gap, this progress report details the basic principles of microfluidic reactor design and performance, as well as the current state of online diagnostics and autonomous robotic experimentation strategies, toward the size, shape, and composition&#8208;controlled synthesis of various colloidal nanomaterials. By discussing the application of fluidic platforms in recent high&#8208;priority colloidal nanomaterial studies and their potential for integration with rapidly emerging artificial intelligence&#8208;based decision&#8208;making strategies, this report seeks to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between microfluidic reactor engineers and colloidal nanomaterial chemists. Full convergence of these two research efforts offers significantly expedited and enhanced nanomaterial discovery, optimization, and manufacturing.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Field&#8208;Tailored T1&#8211;T2 Dual&#8208;Mode MRI Contrast Agent for High&#8208;Performance Vascular Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh magnetic field (UHF)&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with a near&#8208;paramagnetic core and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification is developed, which exhibits a dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under UHF. By virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode imaging enables the assessment of the vascular anatomy and functions with high sensitivity and accuracy.








Abstract
The assessment of vascular anatomy and functions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for medical diagnosis, whereas the commonly used low&#8208;field MRI system (&#8804;3 T) suffers from low spatial resolution. Ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI (&#8805;7 T), with significantly improved resolution and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, shows great potential to provide high&#8208;resolution vasculature images. However, practical applications of UHF MRI technology for vascular imaging are currently limited by the low sensitivity and accuracy of single&#8208;mode (T1 or T2) contrast agents. Herein, a UHF&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with extremely small core size and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification, exhibiting dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under the 7 T magnetic field, is reported. The UDIOC enables clear visualization of microvasculature as small as &#8776;140&#160;&#181;m in diameter under UHF MRI, extending the detection limit of the 7 T MR angiography. Moreover, by virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF MRI and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode dynamic contrast&#8208;enhanced MRI is successfully applied to detect tumor vascular permeability with extremely high sensitivity and accuracy, providing a novel paradigm for the precise medical diagnosis of vascular&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Realization of Regular&#8208;Mixed Quasi&#8208;1D Borophene Chains with Long&#8208;Range Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
New structural phases of borophene grown by molecular beam epitaxy are observed on a Ag(100) substrate. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and ab initio calculations are consistent in the discovery of mixed phases, which can be described as a combination of quasi&#8208;1D borophene chains and can be separated by substrate orientation.








Abstract
The polymorphism of borophene makes it a promising system to realize tunable physical or chemical properties. Various pure borophene phases consisting of quasi&#8208;1D boron chains with different widths have been commonly obtained in experimental studies. Here, it is shown that, due to a substrate mediation effect, artificial long&#8208;range ordered phases of borophene consisting of different combinations of boron chains seamlessly joined together can be achieved on Ag(100). Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that mixed&#8208;chain phases are more stable than the pure phase, and interact only weakly with the substrate. The mixed&#8208;chain phases with various proportions of different chains can be well separated based on the crystal direction of the substrate. The successful growth of mixed&#8208;chain phases is expected to deepen the impact of substrate tailored synthesis of borophene.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via an Unconjugated Donor&#8211;Acceptor System Realizing EQE of Over 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter, 2tDMG, is designed and synthesized based on the donor (D)/acceptor (A) spatially intramolecular noncovalent interaction. The D/A units are connected via a rigid linker, thereby confining them into a close&#8208;packed coplanar configuration for small singlet&#8211;triplet splitting energy. 2tDMG achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 30.8% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off in evaporation&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

In this work, two novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, 2tDMG and 3tDMG, are synthesized for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), The two emitters have a tilted face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment of donor (D)/acceptor (A) units presenting intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The two TADF materials are deposited either by an evaporation&#8208;process or by a solution&#8208;process, both of them leading to high OLED performance. 2tDMG used as the emitter in evaporation&#8208;processed OLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.8% with a very flat efficiency roll&#8208;off of 7% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The solution&#8208;processed OLEDs also display an interesting EQE of 16.2%. 3tDMG shows improved solubility and solution processability as compared to 2tDMG, and thus a high EQE of 20.2% in solution&#8208;processed OLEDs is recorded. The corresponding evaporation&#8208;processed OLEDs also reach a reasonably high EQE of 26.3%. Encouragingly, this work provides a novel strategy to address the imperious demands for OLEDs with high EQE and low roll&#8208;off.

&lt;p&gt;A thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter, 2tDMG, is designed and synthesized based on the donor (D)/acceptor (A) spatially intramolecular noncovalent interaction. The D/A units are connected via a rigid linker, thereby confining them into a close&#8208;packed coplanar configuration for small singlet&#8211;triplet splitting energy. 2tDMG achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 30.8% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off in evaporation&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <title>Black Bioceramics: Combining Regeneration with Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of black bioceramics is successfully synthesized through a magnesium thermal&#8208;reduction strategy. The black bioceramics possess an excellent skin/bone tumor therapy effect while retaining their initial bioactivity, extending the functions of bioceramics from tissue regeneration to disease therapy. Such black bioceramics, with both cancer therapy and tissue regeneration, should greatly promote the scientific revival and clinical application of bioceramics.








Abstract
Bioceramics have been developed from bioinert to bioactive or biodegradable materials in the past few decades. However, at present, traditional bioceramics are still mainly used in bone tissue regeneration and dental restoration. In this work, a new generation of &#8220;black bioceramics,&#8221; extending the applications from tissue regeneration to disease therapy, is presented. Black bioceramics, through magnesium thermal reduction of traditional white ceramics, including silicate&#8208;based (e.g., CaSiO3, MgSiO3) and phosphate&#8208;based (e.g., Ca3(PO4)2, Ca5(PO4)3(OH)), are successfully synthesized. Due to the presence of oxygen vacancies and structural defects, the black bioceramics possess photothermal functionality while maintaining their initial high bioactivity and regenerative capacity. These black bioceramics show excellent photothermal antitumor effects for both skin and bone tumors. At the same time, they have significantly improved bioactivity for skin/bone tissue repair in vitro and in vivo. These fascinating properties award the black bioceramics with profound applications in both tumor therapy and tissue regeneration, which should greatly promote the scientific relevance and clinical application of bioceramics, representing a promising new direction of cell&#8208;instructive biomaterials.

         <title>Reversible Deposition of Lithium Particles Enabled by Ultraconformal and Stretchable Graphene Film for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacked graphene layers are built in situ on Li metal as an ultraconformal and deformable protective skin. This skin inhibits direct contact between the Li metal and the electrolyte while enabling fast Li&#8208;ion transfer for Li deposition beneath. Interlayer slip and wrinkles ensure the graphene film is ultraconformal during reversible expansion and shrinkage of the micro&#8208;sized Li particles, which suppresses Li dendrites and pulverization.








Abstract
Originating from inhomogeneous Li deposition and dissolution, the formation of dendritic and/or dead Li lies as a fundamental barrier to the practical implementation of Li metal anodes for high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, an ultraconformal and stretchable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of parallelly stacked few&#8208;layer defect&#8208;free graphene nanosheets, which can deform to remain ultraconformal during the expansion and shrinkage of micro&#8208;sized Li metal particles is reported. The shape&#8208;adaptive graphene protective skin is prepared via a facile mechanical method followed by Li stripping, which enables fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and inhibits Li dendrites and Li pulverization. The interlayer slips and wrinkles of the graphene film endow the robust protective skin with high stretchability. This work represents a unique strategy of building ultraconformal and stretchable 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based protective skins on the surface of Li metal toward high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life, and safe Li metal batteries.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Kinetics in 3D Curved Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D curved graphene with a wide range of curvature radii from 25 to 1000 nm demonstrates that nanoscale curvature is a new degree of freedom to tune the transport properties of graphene by manipulating 2D electron kinetics on 3D curved surfaces.








Abstract
3D integration of&#160;graphene has attracted attention for realizing&#160;carbon&#8208;based electronic devices. While the 3D integration can amplify various excellent properties of graphene, the influence of 3D curved surfaces on the fundamental physical properties of graphene has not been clarified. The electronic properties of 3D nanoporous graphene with a curvature radius down to 25&#8211;50 nm are systematically investigated and the ambipolar electronic states of Dirac fermions are essentially preserved in the 3D graphene nanoarchitectures, while the 3D curvature can effectively suppress the slope of the linear density of states of Dirac fermion near the Fermi level are demonstrated. Importantly, the 3D curvature can be utilized to tune the back&#8208;scattering&#8208;suppressed electrical transport of Dirac fermions and enhance&#160;both electron localization and electron&#8211;electron interaction. As a result, nanoscale curvature&#160;provides a new degree of freedom to manipulate&#160;3D graphene electrical properties, which may pave a new way to design new 3D graphene devices with preserved 2D electronic properties&#160;and novel functionalities.

         <title>Negative&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Induced Large Polarization in Nanosized PbTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
0D freestanding PbTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized through a two&#8208;phase solvethermal method. Raised tetragonality, as well as enhanced spontaneous polarization are achieved, induced by a negative pressure along the c axis. This originates from strengthened Pb&#8211;O hybridization induced by plentiful distribution of PbO terminations on the surface of the PbTiO3 NPs, which has been theoretically identified as a crucial factor of ferroelectricity.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials usually undergo decay with particle size decreasing into the nanoscale. At the critical value, the crystal structure undergoes a transition from the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase and the ferroelectricity vanishes. It is a big issue to sufficiently maintain strong ferroelectricity at the nanoscale. Herein, it is reported that synthesized 0D freestanding PbTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) present negative pressure along the c axis (&#916;c/cbulk &#215; 100% =&#160;&#8722;2.406), inducing large spontaneous polarization PS (71.2 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 in 12&#160;nm). Further local structural studies by atomic pair distribution functions and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure indicate the structural evolution of nanosized PbTiO3. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field STEM images reveal the existence of preponderant PbO&#8208;terminations on the surface of the PbTiO3 NPs. Ab initio calculation reveals the enhanced hybridization between Pb and O ions, which gives rise to the negative pressure and tensile stress to stabilize the high tetragonality and large polarization. The present work demonstrates an untraditional route to enhance the ferroelectricity and related properties in functional nanostructured materials, being of significance to nanodevices.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Pole Flip by Millimeter Wave</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, is demonstrated by irradiating a focused millimeter wave onto epsilon iron oxide. In F&#8208;MIMR, the magnetic pole direction is instantly switched by the focused millimeter wave generated from terahertz light, and the heat&#8208;up effect of the recording media is suppressed. Thus, F&#8208;MIMR can be applied to high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.








Abstract
In the era of Big Data and the Internet of Things, data archiving is a key technology. From this viewpoint, magnetic recordings are drawing attention because they guarantee long&#8208;term data storage. To archive an enormous amount of data, further increase of the recording density is necessary. Herein a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR),&#8221; is proposed. To test this methodology, magnetic films based on epsilon iron oxide nanoparticles are prepared and a focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave generator is constructed using terahertz (THz) light. Irradiating the focused millimeter wave to epsilon iron oxide instantly switches its magnetic pole direction. The spin dynamics of F&#8208;MIMR are also calculated using the stochastic Landau&#8211;Lifshitz&#8211;Gilbert model considering all of the spins in an epsilon iron oxide nanoparticle. In F&#8208;MIMR, the heat&#8208;up effect of the recording media is expected to be suppressed. Thus, F&#8208;MIMR can be applied to high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.

         <title>Highly Ordered 2D&#8208;Assemblies of Phase&#8208;Segregated Block Molecules for Upconverted Linearly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8208;energy&#8208;migration&#8208;based photon upconversion is demonstrated in films of 2D crystalline sheets of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene functionalized with discrete&#8208;length oligodimethylsiloxane. Annealing increases the upconverted photoluminescence intensity up to 100&#8208;fold due to increased chromophore ordering and enhanced donor dispersion. Upconversion imaging microscopy spatially resolves the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion intensity with micrometer resolution. Millimeter&#8208;sized domains show linearly polarized upconverted emission.








Abstract
Materials based on the laminar ordering of self&#8208;assembled molecules have a unique potential for applications requiring efficient energy migration through densely packed chromophores. Here, employing molecular assemblies of coil&#8211;rod&#8211;coil block molecules for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based on triplet energy migration with linearly polarized emission is reported. By covalently attaching discrete&#8208;length oligodimethylsiloxane (oDMS) to 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA), highly ordered 2D crystalline DPA sheets separated by oDMS layers are obtained. Transparent films of this material doped with small amounts of triplet sensitizer PtII octaethylporphyrin show air&#8208;stable TTA&#8208;UC under non&#8208;coherent excitation. Upon annealing, an increase in TTA&#8208;UC up to two orders of magnitude is observed originating from both an improved molecular ordering of DPA and an increased dispersion of the sensitizer. The molecular alignment in millimeter&#8208;sized domains leads to upconverted linearly polarized emission without alignment layers. By using a novel technique, upconversion imaging microscopy, the TTA&#8208;UC intensity is spatially resolved on a micrometer scale to visually demonstrate the importance of molecular dispersion of sensitizer molecules for efficient TTA&#8208;UC. The reported results are promising for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and 3D night&#8208;vision applications, but also exemplify the potential of discrete oligodimethylsiloxane functionalized chromophores for highly aligned and densely packed molecular materials.

         <title>Dislocation&#8208;Strained IrNi Alloy Nanoparticles Driven by Thermal Shock for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dislocation&#8208;strained IrNi nanoparticles with competitive HER activity are realized by unsteady thermal shock progress in an extreme environment, and they are uniformly distributed within a carbon nanotube sponge (DSIrNi@CNTS). Numerous dislocations are generated in self&#8208;assembled IrNi nanoparticles due to ultrafast quenching, inducing strain effects into the IrNi nanoparticles, which optimize the electronic structure of the active sites.








Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts is crucial for the electrochemical production of hydrogen. Dislocation&#8208;strained IrNi nanoparticles loaded on a carbon nanotube sponge (DSIrNi@CNTS) driven by unsteady thermal shock in an extreme environment are reported here as a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. Experimental results demonstrate that numerous dislocations are kinetically trapped in self&#8208;assembled IrNi nanoparticles due to the ultrafast quenching and different atomic radii, which can induce strain effects into the IrNi nanoparticles. Such strain&#8208;induced high&#8208;energy surface structures arising from bulk defects (dislocations), are more likely to be resistant to surface restructuring during catalysis. The catalyst exhibits outstanding HER activity with only 17 mV overpotential to achieve 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline electrolyte with fabulous stability, exceeding state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts.&#160;These&#160;density functional theory results demonstrate that the electronic structure of as&#8208;synthesized IrNi nanostructure can be optimized by the strain effects induced by the dislocations, and the free energy of HER can be tuned toward the optimal region.

         <title>Neutrophils Enable Local and Non&#8208;Invasive Liposome Delivery to Inflamed Skeletal Muscle and Ischemic Heart</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutrophil&#8208;based drug delivery system, obtained through ex vivo neutrophil loading and intravenous reinjection, is designed to transport methotrexate (MTX)&#8208;loaded liposomes to inflamed tissue. This hybrid system efficiently delivers liposomes to inflamed skeletal muscle and ischemia reperfusion injured myocardium. Upon arrival in the inflamed muscle, neutrophils release the MTX&#8208;loaded liposomes with anti&#8208;inflammatory outcome.








Abstract
Uncontrolled inflammation is a major pathological factor underlying a range of diseases including autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Improving localized delivery of immunosuppressive drugs to inflamed tissue in a non&#8208;invasive manner offers significant promise to reduce severe side effects caused by systemic administration. Here, a neutrophil&#8208;mediated delivery system able to transport drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers to inflamed tissue by exploiting the inherent ability of neutrophils to migrate to inflammatory tissue is reported. This hybrid system (neutrophils loaded with liposomes ex vivo) efficiently migrates in vitro following an inflammatory chemokine gradient. Furthermore, the triggered release of loaded liposomes and reuptake by target macrophages is studied. The migratory behavior of liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils is confirmed in vivo by demonstrating the delivery of drug&#8208;loaded liposomes to an inflamed skeletal muscle in mice. A single low&#8208;dose injection of the hybrid system locally reduces inflammatory cytokine levels. Biodistribution of liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils in a human&#8208;disease&#8208;relevant myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury mouse model after i.v. injection confirms the ability of injected neutrophils to carry loaded liposomes to inflammation sites. This strategy shows the potential of nanocarrier&#8208;loaded neutrophils as a universal platform to deliver anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs to promote tissue regeneration in inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Adhesive Molybdenum Disulfide/rGO Vertical Heterostructures with Enhanced Nanozyme Activity for Smart Bacterial Killing Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum disulfide/rGO vertical heterostructures are demonstrated to possess triple enzyme&#8208;like activities, which are further enhanced through light irradiation. Coupled with the rough surface that contributes excellent capacity for bacterial capture, preeminent antibacterial efficacy against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria is exhibited both in vitro and in vivo by such a defect&#8208;rich adhesive nanozyme, which will blaze a new path for the development of alternative antibiotics.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activities, namely &#8220;nanozymes,&#8221; are showing increasing potential as a new type of broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. However, their feasibility is still far from satisfactory, due to their low catalytic activity, poor bacterial capturing capacity, and complicated material design. Herein, a facile synthesis of a defect&#8208;rich adhesive molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/rGO vertical heterostructure (VHS) through a one&#8208;step microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method is reported. This simple, convenient but effective method for rapid material synthesis enables extremely uniform and well&#8208;dispersed MoS2/rGO VHS with abundant S and Mo vacancies and rough surface, for a performance approaching the requirements of practical application. It is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the as&#8208;prepared MoS2/rGO VHS possesses defect and irradiation dual&#8208;enhanced triple enzyme&#8208;like activities (oxidase, peroxidase, and catalase) for promoting free&#8208;radical generation, owing to much more active edge sites exposure. Meanwhile, the VHS&#8208;achieved rough surface exhibits excellent capacity for bacterial capture, with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) destruction through local topological interactions. As a result, optimized efficacy against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria can be explored by such defect&#8208;rich adhesive nanozymes, demonstrating a simple but powerful way to engineered nanozymes for alternative antibiotics.

         <title>Six Birds with One Stone: Versatile Nanoporphyrin for Single&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Synergistic Phototheranostics and Robust Immune Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipo) that is self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is developed for multifunctional cancer theranostics. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with two different proportions of Pp18&#8208;lipids can simultaneously realize photoacoustic imaging, fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immune activation.








Abstract
Simultaneous photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can reduce the risks of drug leakage, body burden, and preparation complexity in traditional combination PDT/PTT. Here, a versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipos) self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is presented. The as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with 2 mol% Pp18&#8208;lipids can perform effective PDT and fluorescence imaging. The Pp18&#8208;lipos with 65 mol% Pp18 can perform potent PTT and photoacoustic imaging. The chelation of Mn2+ endows the Pp18&#8208;lipids&#8208;Mn2+ a high T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging contrast. Notably, pretreatment of low&#8208;dose PDT facilitates the endocytosis and tumor accumulation of Pp18&#8208;lipos, thus achieving synergistic PDT/PTT. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the combination of PDT/PTT achieves a significantly higher tumor growth inhibition rate than PDT or PTT alone. In addition, it is found that the synergistic PDT/PTT triggers more potent anti&#8208;tumor immune response including tumor infiltration of immune cells and release of related cytokines.

         <title>Microfabricated Ion&#8208;Selective Transistors with Fast and Super&#8208;Nernstian Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfabricated ion&#8208;selective transistors with fast response and super&#8208;Nernstian sensitivity are demonstrated. The remarkable performance arises from the use of a thin polyelectrolyte film as an internal ion reservoir between the ion&#8208;selective membrane and the organic electrochemical transistor. The sensor architecture is generic and applicable to sensing of various ions, opening new frontiers for wearable and implantable ion sensors.








Abstract
Transistor&#8208;based ion sensors have evolved significantly, but the best&#8208;performing ones rely on a liquid electrolyte as an internal ion reservoir between the ion&#8208;selective membrane and the channel. This liquid reservoir makes sensor miniaturization difficult and leads to devices that are bulky and have limited mechanical flexibility, which is holding back the development of high&#8208;performance wearable/implantable ion sensors. This work demonstrates microfabricated ion&#8208;selective organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with a transconductance of 4&#160;mS, in which a thin polyelectrolyte film with mobile sodium ions replaces the liquid reservoir. These devices are capable of selective detection of various ions with a fast response time (&#8776;1&#160;s), a super&#8208;Nernstian sensitivity (85&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), and a high current sensitivity (224&#160;&#181;A&#160;dec&#8722;1), comparing favorably to other ion sensors based on traditional and emerging materials. Furthermore, the ion&#8208;selective OECTs are stable with highly reproducible sensitivity even after 5 months. These characteristics pave the way for new applications in implantable and wearable electronics.

         <title>A Tuned Alternating D&#8211;A Copolymer Hole&#8208;Transport Layer Enables Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Superior Fill Factor and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new DPP&#8208;based alternating D&#8211;A copolymer (PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP) is developed for use as a hole&#8208;transport layer. PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP addresses the different requirements for an HTL, offering favorable energetics, near&#8208;infrared absorption, and efficient charge transfer. Therefore, a PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP&#8208;based device achieves a remarkable FF of 70% and the highest PCE of 14.0% among PbS CQD&#8208;SCs.








Abstract
The need for optoelectronic and chemical compatibility between the layers in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photovoltaic devices remains a bottleneck in further increasing performance. Conjugated polymers are promising candidates as new hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) materials in CQD solar cells (CQD&#8208;SCs) owing to the highly tunable optoelectronic properties and compatible chemistries. A diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer with benzothiadiazole derivatives (PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP) as an HTL in these devices is reported. The energy level, molecular orientation, and hole mobility of this HTL are manipulated through molecular engineering. By levering the polymer's optical absorption spectrum complementary to that of the CQD active layer, EQE across the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions is maximized. As a result, a PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP&#8208;based device exhibits a fill factor of 70% and approximately 35% efficiency enhancement compared to a PTB7&#8208;based device.

Currently, due to the lack of precise control of flow behavior and the understanding of how it influences thin&#8208;film crystallization, strict tuning of thin&#8208;film properties during solution&#8208;based coating is difficult. In this work, a continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic&#8208;channel&#8208;based meniscus&#8208;guided coating (CoMiC) is introduced, which is a system that enables manipulation of flow patterns and analysis connecting flow pattern, crystallization, and thin&#8208;film properties. Continuous supply of a solution of an organic semiconductor with various flow patterns is generated using microfluidic channels. 3D numerical simulations and in situ microscopy allow the tracking of the flow pattern along its entire path (from within the microfluidic channel to near the liquid&#8211;solid boundary), and enable direct observation of thin&#8208;film crystallization process. In particular, the generation of chaotic flow results in unprecedented device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity, with coefficient of variation (CV) of 7.3% and average mobility of 2.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in doped TIPS&#8208;pentacene. Furthermore, CV and average mobility of 9.6% and 11.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are achieved, respectively, in a small molecule:polymer blend system. CoMiC can serve as a guideline for elucidating the relation between flow behavior, liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition, and device performance, which has thus far been unknown.

         <title>Promoted Photocharge Separation in 2D Lateral Epitaxial Heterostructure for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D lateral heterostructure is in situ fabricated. Benefiting from the strong chemical bonding at the heterointerface, a strong internal electric field is generated between two components of the heterostructure, which facilitates photoexcited charge separation and transfer kinetics, and results in improved solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Photocarrier recombination remains a big barrier for the improvement of solar energy conversion efficiency. For 2D materials, construction of heterostructures represents an efficient strategy to promote photoexcited carrier separation via an internal electric field at the heterointerface. However, due to the difficulty in seeking two components with suitable crystal lattice mismatch, most of the current 2D heterostructures are vertical heterostructures and the exploration of 2D lateral heterostructures is scarce and limited. Here, lateral epitaxial heterostructures of BiOCl&#8202;@&#8202;Bi2O3 at the atomic level are fabricated via sonicating&#8208;assisted etching of Cl in BiOCl. This unique lateral heterostructure expedites photoexcited charge separation and transportation through the internal electric field induced by chemical bonding at the lateral interface. As a result, the lateral BiOCl&#8202;@&#8202;Bi2O3 heterostructure demonstrates superior CO2 photoreduction properties with a CO yield rate of about 30&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible light illumination. The strategy to fabricate lateral epitaxial heterostructures in this work is expected to provide inspiration for preparing other 2D lateral heterostructures used in optoelectronic devices, energy conversion, and storage fields.

         <title>Precisely Controlling the Position of Bromine on the End Group Enables Well&#8208;Regular Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiencies over 15%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two well&#8208;regular polymer acceptors (PY&#8208;IT and PY&#8208;OT) with different polymerization sites are developed. For comparison, a random ternary copolymer (PY&#8208;IOT) with the same ratio of the two acceptors is synthesized. All&#8208;polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT achieve an excellent PCE of 15.05%, which is significantly higher than those based on PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%).








Abstract
Recent advances in the development of polymerized A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) have promoted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) over 13%. However, the monomer of an SMA typically consists of a mixture of three isomers due to the regio&#8208;isomeric brominated end groups (IC&#8208;Br(in) and IC&#8208;Br(out)). In this work, the two isomeric end groups are successfully separated, the regioisomeric issue is solved, and three polymer acceptors, named PY&#8208;IT, PY&#8208;OT, and PY&#8208;IOT, are developed, where PY&#8208;IOT is a random terpolymer with the same ratio of the two acceptors. Interestingly, from PY&#8208;OT, PY&#8208;IOT to PY&#8208;IT, the absorption edge gradually redshifts and electron mobility progressively increases. Theory calculation indicates that the LUMOs are distributed on the entire molecular backbone of PY&#8208;IT, contributing to the enhanced electron transport. Consequently, the PM6:PY&#8208;IT system achieves an excellent PCE of 15.05%, significantly higher than those for PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%). Morphological and device characterization reveals that the highest PCE for the PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based device is the fruit of enhanced absorption, more balanced charge transport, and favorable morphology. This work demonstrates that the site of polymerization on SMAs strongly affects device performance, offering insights into the development of efficient polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Driven Gradients of Diamagnetic Objects for Engineering Complex Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and predictable magnetics&#8208;based approach is developed and implemented to pattern a range of diamagnetic objects, including living cells, in 3D crosslinkable solutions without magnetically tagging the objects. This approach is applied to engineer complex tissues that mimic the native depth&#8208;dependent cellularity of articular cartilage. This work provides a foundation for engineers to create opposing gradients in continuous materials.








Abstract
Engineering complex tissues represents an extraordinary challenge and, to date, there have been few strategies developed that can easily recapitulate native&#8208;like cell and biofactor gradients in 3D materials. This is true despite the fact that mimicry of these gradients may be essential for the functionality of engineered graft tissues. Here, a non&#8208;traditional magnetics&#8208;based approach is developed to predictably position naturally diamagnetic objects in 3D hydrogels. Rather than magnetizing the objects within the hydrogel, the magnetic susceptibility of the surrounding hydrogel precursor solution is enhanced. In this way, a range of diamagnetic objects (e.g., polystyrene beads, drug delivery microcapsules, and living cells) are patterned in response to a brief exposure to a magnetic field. Upon photo&#8208;crosslinking the hydrogel precursor, object positioning is maintained, and the magnetic contrast agent diffuses out of the hydrogel, supporting long&#8208;term construct viability. This approach is applied to engineer cartilage constructs with a depth&#8208;dependent cellularity mirroring that of native tissue. These are thought to be the first results showing that magnetically unaltered cells can be magneto&#8208;patterned in hydrogels and cultured to generate heterogeneous tissues. This work provides a foundation for the formation of opposing magnetic&#8208;susceptibility&#8208;based gradients within a single continuous material.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Unidirectional Manipulation of Microdroplets by Horizontal Vibration on Femtosecond Laser&#8208;Induced Slant Microwall Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;performance unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets, such as multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90&#176; turning, and sequential transport), large&#8208;volume&#8208;range and high&#8208;speed transport, by horizontal vibration is achieved on a polymeric substrate with slant microgroove arrays fabricated by femtosecond laser oblique ablation technology, demonstrating great potential in the field of liquid microreactions.








Abstract
The high&#8208;performance unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets is crucial for many vital applications including water collection and bioanalysis. Among several actuation methods (e.g., electric, magnetic, light, and thermal actuation), mechanical vibration is pollution&#8208;free and biocompatible. However, it suffers from limited droplet movement mode, small volume range (VMax/VMin&#160;&lt;&#160;3), and low transport velocity (&#8804;11.5&#160;mm s&#8722;1) because the droplet motion is a sliding state caused by the vertical vibration on the asymmetric hydrophobic microstructures. Here, an alternative strategy is proposed&#8212;horizontal vibration for multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90o turning, and sequential transport), large&#8208;volume&#8208;range (VMax/VMin&#160;&#8776; 100), and high&#8208;speed (&#8776;22.86&#160;mm s&#8722;1) unidirectional microdroplet manipulation, which is ascribed to the rolling state on superhydrophobic slant microwall arrays (SMWAs) fabricated by the one&#8208;step femtosecond laser oblique ablation. The unidirectional transport mechanism relies on the variance of viscous resistance induced by the difference of contact area between the microdroplet and the slant microwalls. Furthermore, a circular, curved, and &#8220;L&#8221;&#8208;shaped SMWA is designed and fabricated for droplet motion with particular paths. Finally, sequential transport of large&#8208;volume&#8208;range droplets and chemical mixing microreaction of water&#8208;based droplets are demonstrated on the SMWA, which demonstrates the great potential in the field of microdroplet manipulation.

         <title>Spontaneous (Anti)meron Chains in the Domain Walls of van der Waals Ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of (anti)meron chains from conventional domain walls is directly observed at zero field in 2D ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2, which closely correlates with the weak van der Waals interaction and temperature&#8208;dependent spin anisotropy transformation. The simultaneous topological Hall effect and the collectively dynamic behavior of the (anti)meron chains under external fields experimentally highlight the theoretical prediction of magnetic&#8208;domain&#8208;wall topology.








Abstract
The promise of topologically vortex&#8208;like magnetic spin textures hinges on the intriguing physical properties and theories in fundamental research and their distinguished roles as high&#8208;efficiency information units in future spintronics. The exploration of such magnetic states with unique spin configurations has never ceased. In this study, the emergence of unconventional (anti)meron chains from a domain wall pair is directly observed at zero field in 2D ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2, closely correlated with significant enhancement of the in&#8208;plane magnetization and weak van der Waals interactions. The simultaneous appearance of a large topological Hall effect is observed at the same temperature range as that of the abnormal magnetic transition. Moreover, the distinctive features of the (anti)meron chains and their collective dynamic behavior under external fields may provide concrete experimental evidence for the recent theoretical prediction of the magnetic&#8208;domain&#8208;wall topology and endorse a broader range of possibilities for electronics, spintronics, condensed matter physics, etc.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Ion&#8208;Responsive Antimicrobial Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) can be achieved in a porphyrin&#8208;based anionic HOF structure, endowing the material with synergistic photodynamic and chemical antimicrobial efficacy. By further taking advantage of the unbonded carboxyl groups on the HOF particle surface, a freestanding flexible membrane that shows high permeability, good stability, and excellent antibacterial activity is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Functionalization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for specific applications has been a long&#8208;lasting challenge in HOF materials. Here, an efficient way to integrate functional species in the HOF structure through constructing an anionic framework is presented. The obtained HOFs, taking PFC&#8208;33 (PFC = porous materials from FJIRSM,CAS) as an example, integrate a porphyrin photosensitizer as a porous backbone and a commercial biocide as counterions in the structure. The permanent channels and the electrostatic interaction between the framework and the counterions provide PFC&#8208;33 ion&#8208;responsive biocide&#8208;release behavior in various physiological environments, thus exhibiting synergistic photodynamic and chemical antimicrobial efficiency. The unbonded carboxyl groups residing on the HOF surface further allow for manipulating the interfacial interaction between the PFC&#8208;33 and the polymer matrix for membrane fabrication. Therefore, a polyHOF membrane with high stability, desired flexibility, and good permeability is obtained, which demonstrates noticeable bacterial inhibition toward Escherichia coli. This study may shed light on the functionalization of HOF materials for broad application potentials.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Derivative Valleytronics</title>

         <dc:description>
An atomically thin all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite derivative, Cs3Bi2I9, which exhibits strong light&#8211;matter interaction, is synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition method. Robust optical helicity is observed in all odd&#8208;layer&#8208;number crystals with inversion symmetry breaking, indicating excitonic coherence extending well beyond 11 layers. The excellent optical and valley properties of Cs3Bi2I9 arise from the unique parallel bands, according to first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are revolutionizing the renewable energy sector owing to their high photovoltaic efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility. Their remarkable mobility and long carrier lifetime are also valuable for information technology, but fundamental challenges like poor stability under an electric field prevent realistic applications of halide perovskites in electronics. Here, it is discovered that valleytronics is a promising route to leverage the advantages of halide perovskites and derivatives for information storage and processing. The synthesized all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite derivative, Cs3Bi2I9, exhibits strong light&#8211;matter interaction and parity&#8208;dependent optically addressable valley degree of freedom. Robust optical helicity in all odd&#8208;layer&#8208;number crystals with inversion symmetry breaking is observed, indicating excitonic coherence extending well beyond 11 layers. The excellent optical and valley properties of Cs3Bi2I9 arise from the unique parallel bands, according to first principles calculations. This discovery points to new materials design principles for scalable valleytronic devices and demonstrates the promise of perovskite derivatives beyond energy applications.

         <title>Isotope Effect in the Magneto&#8208;Optoelectronic Response of Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Donor&#8211;Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence of donor&#8211;acceptor blends, both the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence response and electron magnetic resonance spectrum are found to be independent of the particular hydrogen isotope (protium or deuterium) present. This shows that the reverse intersystem crossing process from the triplet to singlet states occurs in the exciplex manifold rather than that of the polaron pair.








Abstract
The isotope effect is studied in the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence (MEL) and pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from donor&#8211;acceptor exciplexes that are either protonated (H) or deuterated (D). It is found that at ambient temperature, the exchange of H to D has no effect on the spin&#8208;dependent current and MEL responses in the devices. However, at cryogenic temperatures, where the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet exciplex diminishes, a pronounced isotope effect is observed. These results show that the RISC process is not governed by the hyperfine interaction as thought previously, but proceeds through spin&#8208;mixing in the triplet exciplex. The observations are corroborated by electrically detected transient spin nutation experiments that show relatively long dephasing time at ambient temperature, and interpreted in the context of a model that involves exchange and hyperfine interactions in the spin triplet exciplex. These findings deepen the understanding of the RISC process in TADF materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The isotope effect is studied in the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence (MEL) and pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from donor&#8211;acceptor exciplexes that are either protonated (H) or deuterated (D). It is found that at ambient temperature, the exchange of H to D has no effect on the spin&#8208;dependent current and MEL responses in the devices. However, at cryogenic temperatures, where the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet exciplex diminishes, a pronounced isotope effect is observed. These results show that the RISC process is not governed by the hyperfine interaction as thought previously, but proceeds through spin&#8208;mixing in the triplet exciplex. The observations are corroborated by electrically detected transient spin nutation experiments that show relatively long dephasing time at ambient temperature, and interpreted in the context of a model that involves exchange and hyperfine interactions in the spin triplet exciplex. These findings deepen the understanding of the RISC process in TADF materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Adaptable Cryptosystem Enabled by Synergies of Luminogens with Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Character</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptable optical cryptosystem is established based on the synergies among three interconnected and orthogonal covalent reactions concerning aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens. The four variants adapted by organizing the reactions and molecules in different ways allow the balance between accessibility and security, variable decryption from individual encryption, and reconstruction of hidden chemical information through given algorithms.








Abstract
The strong emission in the solid state and the feasibility of introducing stimuli responsiveness make aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens promising for optical information encryption. Yet, the vast majority of previous reports rely on subtle changes in the molecular conformation or intermolecular interactions, limiting the robustness, multiplicity, capacity, and security of the resulting cryptosystems. Herein, a versatile cryptographic system is presented based on three interconnected and orthogonal covalent transformations concerning a tetraphenylethylene&#8211;maleimide conjugate. The cryptosystem is adapted into four configurations with different functionalities by organizing the reactions and molecules in different ways. These variants either balance the accessibility and security of the encrypted information or improve the security and density in data encryption. Significantly, they allow variable decryption from a single encryption and reconstruction of the chemical nature hidden in the fluorescent pattern can only be accessed through given algorithms. These results highlight the importance of multi&#8208;component synergies in advancing information encryption systems, which is enabled by the robustness and diversity stemming from the covalent nature of these transformations.

         <title>Combinatorial Strategy for Studying Biochemical Pathways in Double Emulsion Templated Cell&#8208;Sized Compartments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel combinatorial strategy for studying enzymatic cascade reactions inside synthetic compartments, produced via high&#8208;precision double&#8208;emulsion microfluidics can be applied to any multi&#8208;step cascades, and enables discovering unwanted pathways, detecting undesirable intermediates, and identifying routes for rapid toxins consumption. Such appealing aspects will enhance capabilities of biotechnological applications as enzyme replacement therapy, biological detoxification, chemical synthesis, and biosensors.








Abstract
Cells rely upon producing enzymes at precise rates and stoichiometry for maximizing functionalities. The reasons for this optimal control are unknown, primarily because of the interconnectivity of the enzymatic cascade effects within multi&#8208;step pathways. Here, an elegant strategy for studying such behavior, by controlling segregation/combination of enzymes/metabolites in synthetic cell&#8208;sized compartments, while preserving vital cellular elements is presented. Therefore, compartments shaped into polymer GUVs are developed, producing via high&#8208;precision double&#8208;emulsion microfluidics that enable: i) tight control over the absolute and relative enzymatic contents inside the GUVs, reaching nearly 100% encapsulation and co&#8208;encapsulation efficiencies, and ii) functional reconstitution of biopores and membrane proteins in the GUVs polymeric membrane, thus supporting in situ reactions. GUVs equipped with biopores/membrane proteins and loaded with one or more enzymes are arranged in a variety of combinations that allow the study of a three&#8208;step cascade in multiple topologies. Due to the spatiotemporal control provided, optimum conditions for decreasing the accumulation of inhibitors are unveiled, and benefited from reactive intermediates to maximize the overall cascade efficiency in compartments. The non&#8208;system&#8208;specific feature of the novel strategy makes this system an ideal candidate for the development of new synthetic routes as well as for screening natural and more complex pathways.

         <title>A Freestanding 3D Heterostructure Film Stitched by MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanotube Microsphere Superstructure and Reduced Graphene Oxide Sheets: A Superior Multifunctional Electrode for Overall Water Splitting and Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freestanding 3D heterostructure film stitched by a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived carbon nanotube (CNT) microsphere superstructure and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets is synthesized. The high specific surface area, hierarchical pores, controlled dopants, and conductive CNT@rGO heterostructure render the freestanding film as having excellent multifunctional activity and superior stability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Developing a scalable approach to construct efficient and multifunctional electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an urgent need for overall water splitting and zinc&#8211;air batteries. In this work, a freestanding 3D heterostructure film is synthesized from a Ni&#8208;centered metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)/graphene oxide. During the pyrolysis process, 1D carbon nanotubes formed from the MOF link with the 2D reduced graphene oxide sheets to stitch the 3D freestanding film. The results of the experiments and theoretical calculations show that the synergistic effect of the N&#8208;doped carbon shell and Ni nanoparticles leads to an optimized film with excellent electrocatalytic activity. Low overpotentials of 95 and 260&#160;mV are merely needed for HER and OER, respectively, to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.875&#160;V is obtained for the ORR, which is comparable to that of Pt/RuO2 and ranks among the top of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts. The use of an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; film as the electrode leads to excellent performance of the homemade water electrolyzer and zinc&#8211;air battery, indicating the potential of the film for practical applications.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Functionalized Sonodynamic Treatment for Improving Therapeutic Efficacy and Compliance of Orthotopic Oral Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is developed for the treatment of oral cancer with good compliance. An ultrasound&#8208;responsive mesenchymal stem cells membrane functionalized liposome is designed for co&#8208;delivery of sonosensitizer and oxygen, which not only increases tumor targeting and penetration but also supplies oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, resulting in prolonged survival and maintenance of oral functions.








Abstract
Despite multiple treatment options being available, many critical challenges are still ongoing in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Particularly, the major hurdle is to avoid facial disfigurement and oral function disability during treatment. Herein, nanoengineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are developed as a supersonosensitizer, named M/LPV/O2, for improving nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) against OSCC along with good therapeutic compliance. M/LPV/O2 is composed of an MSCs membrane functionalized liposomal formulation of oxygen&#8208;loading perfluorocarbon and sonosensitizer verteporfin (M/LPV/O2), which can not only increase circulation and targeting efficacy but also supply oxygen to overcome tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;associated resistance in SDT, resulting in enhanced therapeutic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. It is identified that M/LPV/O2 effectively stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species even in hypoxic conditions, and consequently tremendously induces cancer cell death. In addition, M/LPV/O2 displays good tumor accumulation and penetration under ultrasound stimulation, and efficiently induces tumor inhibition and even abrogation, leading to prolonged survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Importantly, M/LPV/O2&#8208;based SDT exhibits minimal systemic adverse effects and successfully maintains oral functions with no facial tissue damage. Therefore, these studies provide a promising therapeutic strategy for OSCC, which has a potential to enhance life quality and compliance after treatment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Winding Gelatin&#8211;Amyloid Wires for Soft Actuators and Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gelatin matrix is loaded with amyloid fibrils, similarly to fiber&#8208;reinforced composites. This material is dry&#8208;spun into wires with asymmetric core&#8211;shell cross&#8208;sections that develop Young's modulus gradients. In water, these wires undergo differential swelling, causing spontaneous self&#8208;winding, corresponding to climbing plants&#8217; tendrils. The functionalization of amyloid fibrils enables the fabrication of functional wires with accurate sensing and actuation properties.








Abstract
The origin of self&#8208;winding mechanisms in plants&#8217; tendrils has fascinated scientists for centuries and continues to inspire developments in material science and nanotechnology. Here, bioinspired water&#8208;responsive wires that replicate these mechanisms, including the formation of coils and chiral perversions, are presented. A right&#8208;handed gelatin matrix is loaded with rigid left&#8208;handed amyloid fibrils and roll&#8211;dry&#8208;spun into wires in which self&#8208;winding activation emerges from simultaneous bending and twisting deformations. Wire bending is a consequence of amyloid fibrils&#8217; concentration and distribution within the wire, whereas twisting is controlled by amyloid fibrils&#8217; orientation. The resultant wires can be functionalized by organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles, and potential applications in magnetic actuators and sensors are demonstrated. The simple fabrication method and the remarkable spontaneous self&#8208;winding response of these gelatin&#8211;amyloid wires exemplify how biomaterials based on mixed proteins have striking potential to develop advanced and tunable properties that can serve robotics, soft machines, and engineering&#160;systems.

         <title>Topological Interlocking and Geometric Stiffening as Complementary Strategies for Strong Plant Shells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seed encapsulation in hard shells is common for protection and dispersal. This study reveals previously unknown functional interrelations between the structure, geometry, and mechanics on multiple length scales in (nut)shells, suggesting that simple geometric modifications, such as the development of puzzle&#8208;shaped instead of round cells, and small spherical shells instead of large ellipsoidal shells, increase their fracture resistance resource&#8208;efficiently.








Abstract
Many organisms encapsulate their embryos in hard, protective shells. While birds and reptiles largely rely on mineralized shells, plants often develop highly robust lignocellulosic shells. Despite the abundance of hard plant shells, particularly nutshells, it remains unclear which fundamental properties drive their mechanical stability. This multiscale analysis of six prominent (nut)shells (pine, pistachio, walnut, pecan, hazelnut, and macadamia) reveals geometric and structural strengthening mechanisms on the cellular and macroscopic length scales. The strongest tissues, found in walnut and pistachio, exploit the topological interlocking of 3D&#8208;puzzle cells and thereby outperform the fiber&#8208;reinforced structure of macadamia under tensile and compressive loading. On the macroscopic scale, strengthening occurs via an increased shell thickness, spherical shape, small size, and a lack of extended sutures. These functional interrelations suggest that simple geometric modifications are a powerful and resource&#8208;efficient strategy for plants to enhance the fracture resistance of entire shells and their tissues. Understanding the interplay between structure, geometry, and mechanics in hard plant shells provides new perspectives on the evolutionary diversification of hard seed coats, as well as insights for nutshell&#8208;based material applications.

In article number 2004897, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi and co&#8208;workers propose a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, to drastically increase the recording density of magnetic tapes.

In article number 2003313, Liting Yan, Jianxing Shen, Xuebo Zhao, Lianzhou Wang, and co&#8208;workers report a facile and versatile MOF&#8208;assisted strategy to construct a freestanding 3D CNT/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) heterostructure film (CGHF). The film shows remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic performance in an alkaline electrolyte and can be used in highly efficient electrodes for overall water splitting and Zn&#8211;air batteries. The strategy is controllable and versatile, and it can be easily extended to prepare binary and even ternary hybrids films for advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202003313"&gt;2003313&lt;/a&gt;, Liting Yan, Jianxing Shen, Xuebo Zhao, Lianzhou Wang, and co&#8208;workers report a facile and versatile MOF&#8208;assisted strategy to construct a freestanding 3D CNT/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) heterostructure film (CGHF). The film shows remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic performance in an alkaline electrolyte and can be used in highly efficient electrodes for overall water splitting and Zn&#8211;air batteries. The strategy is controllable and versatile, and it can be easily extended to prepare binary and even ternary hybrids films for advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

         <title>In a Nutshell: Topological Interlocking and Geometric Stiffening as Complementary Strategies for Strong Plant Shells (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004519, Jessica C. Huss, Notburga Gierlinger, and co&#8208;workers reveal previously unknown functional interrelations between the structure, geometry, and mechanics in (nut)shells. Their multi&#8208;scale analysis suggests that simple geometric modifications, such as the development of puzzle&#8208;shaped instead of round cells, and small spherical shells instead of large ellipsoidal shells, increase the fracture resistance of hard plant shells resource&#8208;efficiently.

         <title>Magnetic Patterning: Magneto&#8208;Driven Gradients of Diamagnetic Objects for Engineering Complex Tissues (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2005030, Robert L. Mauck and co&#8208;workers magnetically pattern diamagnetic objects in 3D hydrogels to engineer complex tissues. Because the diamagnetic objects are suspended in a transiently paramagnetic solution, the objects are repelled from a permanent magnet. Most notably, unlabeled living cells are magneto&#8208;patterned to generate cartilaginous tissues with a native&#8208;like cell gradient.

         <dc:description>
A comprehensive analytical system that connects flow pattern, crystallization, and thin&#8208;film properties is introduced by Steve Park, Jaewook Nam, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2004864. Using 3D&#8208;patterned microfluidic channels, flow pattern is precisely manipulated. 3D numerical simulation and in situ microscopy enable tracking of the flow pattern along its entire path, elucidating its relation to the crystallization process. The resulting organic thin&#8208;film transistors have superior device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity.

         <title>Dendrites in Zn&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;based batteries demonstrate both intrinsic safety and high energy density compared with other metal batteries. Nevertheless, zinc&#8208;dendrite issues such as special morphology and nucleation require unique protections, which develop rapidly and need further improvement. The remaining challenges are discussed and the future directions, i.e., dynamic contact, atomic&#8208;level ionic flow mediation, dendrite protection under high depth of discharge, etc., are proposed.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries that provide a synergistic integration of absolute safety and high energy density have been considered&#160;as highly promising energy&#8208;storage systems for powering&#160;electronics. Despite the rapid progress made in developing high&#8208;performance cathodes and electrolytes, the underestimated but non&#8208;negligible dendrites of&#160;Zn anode have been observed to&#160;shorten battery lifespan. Herein, this dendrite issue in Zn anodes, with regard to fundamentals, protection strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical simulations, is systematically discussed. An overall comparison between the Zn dendrite and its Li and Al counterparts, to highlight their differences in both origin and topology, is given. Subsequently, in&#8208;depth clarifications of the specific influence factors of Zn dendrites, including the accumulation effect and the cathode loading mass (a distinct factor for laboratory studies and practical applications) are presented. Recent advances in Zn dendrite protection are then comprehensively summarized and categorized to generate an overview of respective superiorities and limitations of various strategies. Accordingly, theoretical computations and advanced characterization approaches are introduced as mechanism guidelines and measurement criteria for dendrite suppression, respectively. The concluding section emphasizes future challenges in addressing the Zn dendrite issue and potential approaches to further promoting the lifespan of Zn batteries.

         <title>Size&#8208;Transformable Nanostructures: From Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;transformable nanostructures that can inherit the merits of both small and large ones are powerful platforms for enhanced disease theranostics with long&#8208;term retention, deep penetration, and rapid clearance. Various strategies to realize the transformation between large and small nanostructures are introduced. The biomedical application potential of this kind of nanostructures is also discussed.








Abstract
The size of nanostructures (NSs) strongly affects their chemical and physical properties and further impacts their actions in biological systems. Both small and large NSs possess respective advantages for disease theranostics, and this therefore presents a paradox when choosing NSs with suitable sizes. To overcome this challenge, size&#8208;transformable NSs have emerged as a powerful tool, as they can be manipulated to possess the merits of both types of NSs. Herein, various strategies to construct size&#8208;transformable NSs are summarized, and the recent research progress regarding their biomedical applications, particularly within the fields of cancer and bacterial theranostics, is highlighted. This review will inspire researchers to further develop various methods that can be used to construct size&#8208;transformable NSs for use in novel applications within different fields.
