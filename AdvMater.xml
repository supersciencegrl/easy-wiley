         <title>Superfast Mass Transport of Na/K Via Mesochannels for Dendrite&#8208;Free Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na/K plating&#8211;stripping behaviors in carbon hosts with mesochannels that enable superfast mass transport are systematically studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy. These mesochannels can remarkably increase the accessible surface area, thus boosting the surface ion diffusion, and then becoming the superfast channels for Na/K transport via interfacial diffusion. Such pore&#8208;modified hosts enable dendrite&#8208;free sodium deposition and superior high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Fast ion diffusion in anode hosts enabling uniform distribution of Li/Na/K is essential for achieving dendrite&#8208;free alkali&#8208;metal batteries. Common strategies, e.g. expanding the interlayer spacing of anode materials, can enhance bulk diffusion of Li but are less efficient for Na and K due to their larger ionic radius. Herein, a universal strategy to drastically improve the mass&#8208;transport efficiency of Na/K by introducing open mesochannels in carbon hosts is proposed. Such pore engineering can increase the accessible surface area by one order of magnitude, thus remarkably accelerating surface diffusion, as visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy. In particular, once the mesochannels are filled by the&#160;Na/K metals, they become the superfast channels for mass transport via the mechanism of interfacial diffusion. Thus&#8208;modified carbon hosts enable Na/K filling in their inner cavities and uniform deposition across the whole electrodes with fast kinetics. The resulting Na&#8208;metal anodes can exhibit stable dendrite&#8208;free cycling with outstanding rate performance at a high current density of up to 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work presents an inspiring attempt to address the sluggish transport issue of Na/K, as well as valuable insights into the mass&#8208;transport mechanism in porous anodes for high&#8208;performance alkali&#8208;metal storage.

         <title>Planted Graphene Quantum Dots for Targeted, Enhanced Tumor Imaging and Long&#8208;Term Visualization of Local Pharmacokinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are in situ planted in a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer of PEGylated nanoparticles from small&#8208;molecule pyrene. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo.








Abstract
While photoluminescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have long been considered very suitable for bioimaging owing to their protein&#8208;like size, superhigh photostability and in vivo long&#8208;term biosafety, their unique and crucial bioimaging applications in vivo remain unreachable. Herein, planted GQDs are presented as an excellent tool for in vivo fluorescent, sustainable and multimodality tumor bioimaging in various scenarios. The GQDs are in situ planted in the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer of PEGylated nanoparticles via a bottom&#8208;up molecular approach to obtain the NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG nanocomposite. The planted GQDs show more than four times prolonged blood circulation and 7&#8211;8 times increased tumor accumulation than typical GQDs in vivo. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo. Planting GQDs in PEGylated nanomedicine offers a new strategy for broad in vivo biomedical applications of GQDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing, Reconfigurable, Thermal&#8208;Switching, Transformative Electronics for Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printing solid&#8211;liquid biphasic liquid metal patterns on the hygroscopic hyperbranched polymer substrate demonstrates a self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable device platform with thermal&#8208;switching stiffness and adhesion. Triggered by the increased temperature, the device platform conforms and adheres to the textured skin or other 3D curvilinear surfaces can provide an integrated remote monitoring system for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, long&#8208;term health monitoring of people and structures.








Abstract
Soft, deformable electronic devices provide the means to monitor physiological information and health conditions for disease diagnostics. However, their practical utility is limited due to the lack of intrinsical thermal switching for mechanically transformative adaptability and self&#8208;healing capability against mechanical damages. Here, the design concepts, materials and physics, manufacturing approaches, and application opportunities of self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable, thermal&#8208;switching device platforms based on hyperbranched polymers and biphasic liquid metal are reported. The former provides excellent self&#8208;healing performance and unique tunable stiffness and adhesion regulated by temperature for the on&#8208;skin switch, whereas the latter results in liquid metal circuits with extreme stretchability (&gt;900%) and high conductivity (3.40&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), as well as simple recycling capability. Triggered by the increased temperature from the skin surface, a multifunctional device platform can conveniently conform and strongly adhere to the hierarchically textured skin surface for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, comfortable health monitoring. Additionally, the self&#8208;healing and adhesive characteristics allow multiple multifunctional circuit components to assemble and completely wrap on 3D curvilinear surfaces. Together, the design, manufacturing, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;healing, transformative, and self&#8208;assembled electronics open up new opportunities for robust soft deformable devices, smart robotics, prosthetics, and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, and human&#8211;machine interfaces on irregular surfaces.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Robotics with Tailored Wettability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising tools in a variety of biomedical, sensing, and decontamination applications. The review encompasses the basic understanding, theory, and up&#8208;to&#8208;date developments related to SSRs with tailored wettabilities, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter&#8208;, micrometer&#8208;, and nanometer&#8208;scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand&#8208;new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications. With continued innovation, rational surface engineering is expected to endow SSRs with exceptional mobility and functionality, which can broaden their applications, enhance their penetration depth, reduce surface fouling, and inhibit bacterial adhesion.

         <title>Unveiling Charge&#8208;Transport Mechanisms in Electronic Devices Based on Defect&#8208;Engineered MoS2 Covalent Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent networks of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent an efficient strategy to reduce the interflake junction resistance in thin&#8208;film devices. This multiscale investigation reveals that the molecular structure of the linker is crucial to control the overall charge&#8208;transport mechanisms. This work highlights the great potential of defect engineering for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance devices based on covalent TMD networks.








Abstract
Device performance of solution&#8208;processed 2D semiconductors in printed electronics has been limited so far by structural defects and high interflake junction resistance. Covalently interconnected networks of transition metal dichalcogenides potentially represent an efficient strategy to overcome both limitations simultaneously. Yet, the charge&#8208;transport properties in such systems have not been systematically researched. Here, the charge&#8208;transport mechanisms of printed devices based on covalent MoS2 networks are unveiled via multiscale analysis, comparing the effects of aromatic versus aliphatic dithiolated linkers. Temperature&#8208;dependent electrical measurements reveal hopping as the dominant transport mechanism: aliphatic systems lead to 3D variable range hopping, unlike the nearest neighbor hopping observed for aromatic linkers. The novel analysis based on percolation theory attributes the superior performance of devices functionalized with &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules to the improved interflake electronic connectivity and formation of additional percolation paths, as further corroborated by density functional calculations. Valuable guidelines for harnessing the charge&#8208;transport properties in MoS2 devices based on covalent networks are provided.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent networks of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent an efficient strategy to reduce the interflake junction resistance in thin-film devices. This multiscale investigation reveals that the molecular structure of the linker is crucial to control the overall charge-transport mechanisms. This work highlights the great potential of defect engineering for the fabrication of high-performance devices based on covalent TMD networks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Device performance of solution-processed 2D semiconductors in printed electronics has been limited so far by structural defects and high interflake junction resistance. Covalently interconnected networks of transition metal dichalcogenides potentially represent an efficient strategy to overcome both limitations simultaneously. Yet, the charge-transport properties in such systems have not been systematically researched. Here, the charge-transport mechanisms of printed devices based on covalent MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; networks are unveiled via multiscale analysis, comparing the effects of aromatic versus aliphatic dithiolated linkers. Temperature-dependent electrical measurements reveal hopping as the dominant transport mechanism: aliphatic systems lead to 3D variable range hopping, unlike the nearest neighbor hopping observed for aromatic linkers. The novel analysis based on percolation theory attributes the superior performance of devices functionalized with &#960;-conjugated molecules to the improved interflake electronic connectivity and formation of additional percolation paths, as further corroborated by density functional calculations. Valuable guidelines for harnessing the charge-transport properties in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; devices based on covalent networks are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PIP2 Alteration Caused by Elastic Modulus and Tropism of Electrospun Scaffolds Facilitates Altered BMSCs Proliferation and Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation in tissue engineering. However, it remains challenging to fully understand and modify the differences between stem cell proliferation and differentiation on aligned&#8208;random fibers. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between BMSCs on aligned&#8208;random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels between them through a regulatory mechanism mediated by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p. The results showed that the most significant PIP2 alterations were found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which had a regular and oriented structure, excellent elastic modulus and cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton and movement pattern, high differentiation potential, and the most differentiated PIP2 gene. The same trend was actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells on random fibers and high elastic modulus aligned fibers was altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the apparent cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers. This work demonstrates the reason for the difference of cells between the two kinds of fibers and on fibers with different elastic modulus. It provides more insights for understanding the gene&#8208;level regulation of cell growth in tissue engineering. These findings will greatly help the application and design of 3D tissue culture for tissue engineering.

         <title>Programmed Self&#8208;Assembly of Single Colloidal Gyroid for Chiral Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gyroid structures are of extensive interest because they provide a rich platform for chiroptics as well as topological photonics. While the double gyroid morphology as a bicontinuous structure is not uncommon in self&#8208;assembled soft materials, direct self&#8208;assembly of single network gyroid has proven elusive. Here, an enantiomorphic pair of single gyroid crystals comprising colloidal spheres is presented, and two distinct routes are demonstrated for programmed self&#8208;assembly of each single colloidal gyroid enantiomorph from rationally designed patchy spheres. The designer colloidal patchy spheres, which closely hew to their synthetic feasibility, are chiral, having either two staggered rectangular patches at opposite poles or four circular patches arranged in a well&#8208;defined geometry. The single colloidal gyroid, as well as its inverse structure, is shown to support a wide complete photonic band gap in addition to exhibiting rich chiroptical properties, making them attractive chiral photonic crystals. The versatility of this single colloidal gyroid, the bottom&#8208;up routes devised here in silico and the robustness of the design space for the chiral colloidal patchy spheres together make a strong case for single colloidal gyroid to supersede colloidal diamond, as a target for programmed self&#8208;assembly, in the quest for a photonic crystal operating at optical&#160;frequencies.

         <dc:description>
Various human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) enabling facile detection of human information, followed by visualization of the information have been developed with innovative materials design and device architectures, making them suitable for emerging human&#8211;machine interface technologies including numerous biomedical and healthcare applications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in emerging HISDs with their perspectives for future development.








Abstract
The development of human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) that simultaneously detect and visualize stimuli is important for numerous cutting&#8208;edge human&#8211;machine interface technologies. Therefore, innovative device platforms with optimized architectures of HISDs combined with novel high&#8208;performance sensing and display materials are demonstrated. This study comprehensively reviews the recent advances in HISDs, particularly the device architectures that enable scaling&#8208;down and simplifying the HISD, as well as material designs capable of directly visualizing input information received by various sensors. Various HISD platforms for integrating sensors and displays are described. HISDs consist of a sensor and display connected through a microprocessor, and attempts to assemble the two devices by eliminating the microprocessor are detailed. Single&#8208;device HISD technologies are highlighted in which input stimuli acquired by sensory components are directly visualized with various optical components, such as electroluminescence, mechanoluminescence and structural color. The review forecasts future HISD technologies that demand the development of materials with molecular&#8208;level synthetic precision that enables simultaneous sensing and visualization. Furthermore, emerging HISDs combined with artificial intelligence technologies and those enabling simultaneous detection and visualization of extrasensory information are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Deep learning drives an increasing demand on compute resources. A key operation, matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplication, can potentially be accelerated using cross&#8208;bar interconnects with nodal non&#8208;volatile memory. However, its application today is limited by the properties of the memory elements. Taking a co&#8208;design view, this review addresses the interdependencies of materials and architecture for such cross&#8208;bar hardware for training and inference.








Abstract
Deep learning has&#160;become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from compute&#8208;unit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a cross&#8208;bar architecture with nodal non&#8208;volatile&#8208;memory elements that performs an analog multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate operation, enabling the matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplications repeatedly used in all neural network workloads. The memory materials can significantly influence final system&#8208;level characteristics and chip performance, including speed, power, and classification accuracy. With an over&#8208;arching co&#8208;design viewpoint, this review assesses the use of cross&#8208;bar based CIM for neural networks, connecting the material properties and the associated design constraints and demands to application, architecture, and performance. Both digital and analog memory are considered, assessing the status for training and inference, and providing metrics for the collective set of properties non&#8208;volatile memory materials will need to demonstrate for a successful CIM technology.

         <title>Layered Metal Oxide Nanosheets with Enhanced Interlayer Space for Electrochemical Deionization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered metal oxide with enhanced interlayer spacing is synthesized and employed in electrochemical deionization, achieving high salt adsorption capacity&#160;and adsorption rate, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The electro&#8208;sorption of layered metal oxides originates from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the "memory effect".








Abstract
Electrochemical deionization is regarded as one of the promising water treatment technologies. Here, CoAl&#8208;layered metal oxide nanosheets intercalated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with an enhanced interlayer spacing from 0.76 to 1.33&#160;nm are synthesized and used as an anode. The enlarged interlayer spacing provides an enhanced ion&#8208;diffusion channel and improves the utilization of the interlayer electroactive sites, while heat treatment, transferring layered double hydroxides to layered metal oxides (LMOs), offers additional active oxidation reaction sites to facilitate the electro&#8208;sorption rate, contributing to the high salt adsorption capacity (31.78&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) and average salt adsorption rate (3.75&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1) at 1.2&#160;V in 500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1 NaCl solution. In addition, the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (92.9%) after 40 cycles proves the strong electronic interaction between SDS and the host layer, which is validated by density functional theory calculations later on. Moreover, the electro&#8208;sorption mechanism of LMOs that originated from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the &#8220;memory effect&#8221; is revealed according to the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy peak shifts of Co element. This strategy of expanding the interlayer spacing combined with heat treatment makes LMOs a competitive candidate for electrochemical water deionization.

The enlarged interlayer spacing provides an enhanced ion-diffusion channel and improves the utilization of the interlayer electroactive sites, while heat treatment, transferring layered double hydroxides to layered metal oxides (LMOs), offers additional active oxidation reaction sites to facilitate the electro-sorption rate, contributing to the high salt adsorption capacity (31.78&#160;mg&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and average salt adsorption rate (3.75&#160;mg&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 1.2&#160;V in 500&#160;mg&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; NaCl solution. In addition, the excellent long-term cycling stability (92.9%) after 40 cycles proves the strong electronic interaction between SDS and the host layer, which is validated by density functional theory calculations later on. Moreover, the electro-sorption mechanism of LMOs that originated from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the &#8220;memory effect&#8221; is revealed according to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy peak shifts of Co element. This strategy of expanding the interlayer spacing combined with heat treatment makes LMOs a competitive candidate for electrochemical water deionization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing the Mechanically Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase and the Implications in Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. This review summarizes the desirable mechanical properties of SEI, mechanical characterization methods, and previous optimization attempts. Inconsistencies in these efforts are clarified and the causes are explored. A research protocol is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.








Abstract
The inevitable volume expansion of secondary battery anodes during cycling imposes forces on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The battery performance is closely related to the capability of SEI to maintain intact under the cyclic loading conditions, which basically boils down to the mechanical properties of SEI. The volatile and complex nature of SEI as well as its nanoscale thickness and environmental sensitivity make the interpretation of its mechanical behavior many roadblocks. Widely varied approaches are adopted to investigate the mechanical properties of SEI, and diverse opinions are generated. The lack of consensus at both technical and theoretical levels has hindered the development of effective design strategies to maximize the mechanical stability of SEIs. Here, the essential and desirable mechanical properties of SEI, the available mechanical characterization methods, and important issues meriting attention for higher test accuracy are outlined. Previous attempts to optimize battery performance by tuning SEI mechanical properties are also scrutinized, inconsistencies in these efforts are elucidated, and the underlying causes are explored. Finally, a set of research protocols is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.

         <title>A Molecular Scale Understanding of Misorientation Toughening in Corals and Seashells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Biominerals are organic&#8208;mineral composites formed by living organisms. They are the hardest and toughest tissues in those organisms, are often polycrystalline, and their mesostructure (which includes nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale crystallite size, shape, arrangement, and orientation) can vary dramatically. Marine biominerals may be aragonite, vaterite, or calcite, all calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs, differing in crystal structure. Unexpectedly, diverse CaCO3 biominerals such as coral skeletons and nacre share a similar characteristic: adjacent crystals are slightly misoriented. We document this observation quantitatively at the micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scales, using Polarization&#8208;dependent Imaging Contrast mapping (PIC mapping), and measure the slight misorientations to be consistently between 1&#176;&#8208;40&#176;. Nanoindentation shows that both polycrystalline biominerals and abiotic synthetic spherulites are tougher than single&#8208;crystalline geologic aragonite, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bicrystals at the molecular scale reveals that aragonite, vaterite, and calcite exhibit toughness maxima when they are misoriented by 10&#176;, 20&#176;, and 30&#176;, respectively, demonstrating that slight misorientation alone can increase fracture toughness. Slight misorientation&#8208;toughening can be harnessed for synthesis of bioinspired materials that only require one material, are not limited to specific top&#8208;down architecture, and are easily achieved by self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules (e.g., aspirin, chocolate), polymers, metals, and ceramics well beyond biominerals.

         <title>Dual Behavior Regulation: Tether&#8208;free Deep&#8208;brain Stimulation by Photothermal and Upconversion Hybrid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optogenetics has been plagued by invasive brain implants and thermal effects during photo&#8208;modulation. Here we demonstrate two upconversion hybrid nanoparticles modified with photothermal agents, named PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G, which can modulate neuronal activities via photostimulation and thermo&#8208;stimulation under near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation at 980&#160;nm and 808&#160;nm, respectively. PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G emits visible light (410&#8211;500&#160;nm or 500&#8211;570&#160;nm) through the upconversion process at 980&#160;nm, while they exhibit efficient photothermal effect at 808&#160;nm with no visible emission and tissue damage. Intriguingly, PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B significantly activates extracellular sodium currents in neuro2a (N2a) cells expressing light&#8208;gated channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) ion channels under 980&#8208;nm irradiation, and inhibits potassium currents in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing the voltage&#8208;gated potassium channels (KCNQ1) under 808&#8208;nm irradiation in vitro. Furthermore, deep&#8208;brain bidirectional modulation of feeding behavior was achieved under tether&#8208;free 980&#8208;nm or 808&#8208;nm illumination (0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2) in mice stereotactically injected with PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B in the ChR2&#8208;expressing lateral hypothalamus region. Thus, PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G creates new possibility of utilizing both light and heat to modulate neural activities and provides a viable strategy to overcome the limits of optogenetics.

         <title>Multi&#8208;targeted peptide&#8208;modified gold nanoclusters for treating solid tumors in the liver</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Apoptosis and autophagy determine the fate of cancer cells. However, simply promoting apoptosis of tumor cells is limited in the treatment of unresectable solid liver tumors. Generally, autophagy is considered the anti&#8208;apoptotic &#8220;guardian&#8221;. But the pro&#8208;apoptotic effects of autophagy can be activated by excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, we design amphiphilic peptide&#8208;modified glutathione (GSH)&#8208;gold nanocluster aggregates (AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs) with the enrichment of solid liver tumors and the prolonged stress in the ER, which can achieve the mutual promotion of autophagy and apoptosis in liver tumor cells. In this study, orthotopic and subcutaneous liver tumor models show the anti&#8208;tumor effectiveness of AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs, with a better antitumor effect than sorafenib, biosafety (LD50 of 827.3&#160;mg kg&#8722;1), wide therapeutic window (non&#8208;toxic in 20 times of therapeutic concentration) and high stability (blood half&#8208;life of 4&#160;h). These findings identify an effective strategy to develop peptide&#8208;modified gold nanocluster aggregates with low toxicity, high potency, and selectivity for solid liver tumors treatment.

         <title>Compromising Charge Generation and Recombination of Organic Photovoltaics with Mixed Diluents Strategy for Certified 19.4% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ternary blend has been demonstrated an effective strategy to promote the device performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV) due to the dilution effect. While the compromise between the charge generation and recombination remains a challenge. Here, we proposed a mixed diluents strategy for further improving the device efficiency of OPV. Specifically, the high&#8208;performance OPV system with a polymer donor, i.e., PM6, and a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA), i.e., BTP&#8208;eC9, is diluted by the mixed diluents, which involve a high band gap NFA of BTP&#8208;S17 and a low band gap NFA of BTP&#8208;S16 (similar with that of the BTP&#8208;eC9). The BTP&#8208;S17 of better miscibility with BTP&#8208;eC9 can dramatically enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), while the BTP&#8208;S16 maximizes the charge generation or the short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC). The interplay of BTP&#8208;17 and BTP&#8208;S16 enables better compromise between charge generation and recombination, thus leading to a high device performance of 19.76% (certified 19.41%), which is the best among single&#8208;junction OPVs. Further analysis on carrier dynamics validates the efficacy of mixed diluents for balancing charge generation and recombination, which can be further attributed to the more diverse energetic landscapes and improved morphology. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for high&#8208;performance OPV for further commercialization.

Further analysis on carrier dynamics validates the efficacy of mixed diluents for balancing charge generation and recombination, which can be further attributed to the more diverse energetic landscapes and improved morphology. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for high-performance OPV for further commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;based Therapies for Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Inflammatory diseases (IDs) are a general term that covers all diseases in which chronic inflammation perform as the major manifestation of pathogenesis. Traditional therapies based on the anti&#8208;inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs and are palliative with the short&#8208;term remission. The emerging of nanodrugs has been reported to solve the potential causes and prevent a recurrence, thus holding great potential for the treatment of IDs. Among various nanomaterial systems, transition metal&#8208;based smart nanosystems (TMSNs) with unique electronic structures possess therapeutic advantages owing to their large surface area to volume ratio (S/V ratio), high photothermal conversion efficiency, X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, and multiple catalytic enzyme activities. In this review, we will summarize the rationale, design principle and therapeutic mechanisms of TMSNs for treatments of various IDs. Specifically, TMSNs can not only be designed to scavenge danger signals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA), but also can be engineered to block the mechanism of initiating inflammatory responses. In addition, TMSNs can be further applied as nanocarriers to deliver anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. We conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges of TMSNs, and emphasizing the future directions of TMSNs&#8208;based IDs treatment for clinical applications.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Mechanical Metamaterial with a Controllable Transition in the Poisson's Ratio and Band Gap Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability to significantly change the mechanical and wave propagation properties of a structure without rebuilding it is currently one of the main challenges in the field of mechanical metamaterials. This stems from the enormous appeal that such tunable behavior may offer from the perspective of applications ranging from biomedical to protective devices, particularly in the case of micro&#8208;scale systems. In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration having a very negative Poisson's ratio, corresponding to strong auxeticity, and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The formation of phononic band gaps can also be controlled concurrently which can be very useful for the design of vibration dampers and sensors. Finally, it is experimentally shown that the reconfiguration process can be induced and controlled remotely through application of a magnetic field by using appropriately distributed magnetic inclusions.

         <title>Efficient inorganic vapor&#8208;assisted defects passivation for perovskite solar module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface trap as intrinsic defects&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative charge recombination is a major obstacle to achieving the reliable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics. Here we propose a CS2 vapor&#8208;assisted passivation strategy for perovskite solar module (PSM), aiming to passivate the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ caused by ion migration. Significantly, this method can avoid the disadvantages of inhomogeneity film caused by spin&#8208;coating&#8208;assisted passivation and reconstruction of perovskite surface from solvent. The CS2 vapor passivated perovskite device presents the higher defect formation energy (0.54&#160;eV) of iodine vacancy than the pristine (0.37&#160;eV), while uncoordinated Pb2+ has been bonded with CS2. The shallow level defect passivation of iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ has obviously enhanced the device efficiencies (25.20% for 0.08 cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6 cm2) and the stability, exhibiting an average T80&#8208;lifetime of 1040&#160;h working at the maximum power point, and maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h at RH = 30% and 30 &#176;C.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Chromium Tellurium Compounds with Thickness&#8208;tunable Magnetic Texture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic chromium tellurides exhibit intriguing spin configurations and high&#8208;temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism, providing unprecedented opportunities to explore the fundamental spin physics and build spintronic devices. Here, we developed a generic van der Waals epitaxial approach to synthesize the 2D ternary chromium tellurium compounds with thicknesses down to mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and few&#8208;unit cell (UCs). The Mn0.14Cr0.86Te evolves from intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior in bi&#8208;UC, tri&#8208;UC, and few&#8208; UC to temperature&#8208;induced ferrimagnetic behavior as the thickness increases, resulting in a sign reversal of the anomalous Hall resistance. Temperature&#8208; and thickness&#8208;tunable labyrinthine&#8208;domain ferromagnetic behaviors were derived from the dipolar interactions in Fe0.26Cr0.74Te and Co0.40Cr0.60Te. Furthermore, the dipolar&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced stripe domain and field&#8208;induced domain wall motion (DW) velocity were studied, and multibit data storage was realized through an abundant DW state. The magnetic storage can function in neuromorphic computing tasks, and the pattern recognition accuracy can reach up to 97.93%, which is similar to the recognition accuracy of ideal software&#8208;based training (98.28%). Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic chromium tellurium compounds with intriguing spin configurations can significantly promote the exploration of the processing, sensing, and storage based on 2D magnetic systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Industrial&#8208;Grade p&#8208;Type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 Thermoelectric Enabled by a Stepwise Optimization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As the sole dominator of the commercial thermoelectric (TE) market, Bi2Te3&#8208;based alloys play an irreplaceable role in Peltier cooling and low&#8208;grade waste heat recovery. At present, the main barrier to a wider application is the relatively low efficiency determined by the low&#8208;rise TE figure of merit ZT. Herein, an effective approach is reported for improving the TE performance of p&#8208;type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 by incorporating Ag8GeTe6 and Se. Specifically, the diffused Ag and Ge atoms into the matrix conduce to optimized carrier concentration and enlarged the density of states effective mass while the Sb&#8208;rich nanoprecipitates generate coherent interfaces with little loss of carrier mobility. The subsequent Se dopants introduce multiple phonon scattering sources and significantly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining a decent power factor. Consequently, a high peak ZT of 1.53 at 350 K and a remarkable average ZT of 1.31 (300&#8722;500 K) are attained in the Bi0.4Sb1.6Te0.95Se0.05 + 0.10 wt% Ag8GeTe6 sample. Most noteworthily, the size and mass of the optimal sample have been enlarged to &#216;40 mm&#8208;200&#160;g and the constructed 17&#8208;couple TE module exhibits an extraordinary conversion efficiency &#951; of 6.3% at &#916;T = 245 K. This work demonstrates a facile method to develop high&#8208;performance and industrial&#8208;grade (Bi,Sb)2Te3&#8208;based alloys, which paves a strong way for the further practical applications.

         <title>Integrating Mixed Halide Perovskite Photocatalytic HI Splitting and Electrocatalysis into a Loop for Efficient and Robust Pure Water Splitting</title>

Abstract
Developing a hydrogen economy to replace traditional fossil fuels is essential for sustainable human development. As two promising H2 production strategies, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting with large reaction energy barriers still face the great challenges of poor solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency and large electrochemical overpotentials, respectively. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to disassemble the difficult pure water splitting into two parts that are easy to implement, namely mixed halide perovskite photocatalytic HI splitting for H2 production, and simultaneous electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production. The efficient charge separation, abundant H2 production active sites, and a small HI splitting energy barrier contribute to the superior photocatalytic H2 production activity of MoSe2/MAPbBr3&#8208;xIx. Subsequent electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production reactions only need a small voltage of 0.92&#160;V to drive, which is far lower than that of the electrocatalytic pure water splitting (&gt; 1.23&#160;V). The molar ratio of H2 (6.99&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) to O2 (3.09&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) produced during the first photocatalytic and electrocatalytic cycle is close to 2:1, and the continuous circulation of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; between the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems can achieve efficient and robust pure water splitting.

         <title>Restoration of Sinusoid Fenestrae followed by Targeted Nanoassembly Delivery of an Anti&#8208;Fibrotic Agent Improves Treatment Efficacy in Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
During the onset of liver fibrosis, capillarized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) limit substance exchange between the blood and the Disse space, further accelerating hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) activation and fibrosis progression. Limited accessibility of therapeutics to the Disse space is often overlooked and remains a major bottleneck for HSCs&#8208;targeted therapy in liver fibrosis. Here, we report an integrated systemic strategy for liver fibrosis treatment, utilizing pretreatment with the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, riociguat, followed by insulin growth factor 2 receptor&#8208;mediated targeted delivery of the anti&#8208;fibrosis agent, JQ1, via peptide&#8208;nanoparticles (IGNP&#8208;JQ1). The riociguat reversed the liver sinusoid capillarization to maintain a relatively normal LSECs porosity, thus facilitating the transport of IGNP&#8208;JQ1 through the liver sinusoid endothelium wall and enhancing the accumulation of IGNP&#8208;JQ1 in the Disse space. IGNP&#8208;JQ1 was then selectively taken up by activated HSCs, inhibiting their proliferation and decreasing collagen deposition in the liver. The combined strategy resulted in significant fibrosis resolution in carbon tetrachloride&#8208;induced fibrotic mice as well as methionine&#8208;choline&#8208;deficient diet&#8208;induced non&#8208;alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice. Our work highlights the key role of LSECs in therapeutics transport through the liver sinusoid. The strategy of restoring LSECs fenestrae by riociguat represents a promising approach for liver fibrosis treatment.

         <title>A Scalable Platform for Fabricating Biodegradable Microparticles with Pulsatile Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pulsatile drug delivery systems have the potential to improve patient adherence and therapeutic efficacy by providing a sequence of doses in a single injection. Herein, we develop a novel platform, termed Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED), which enables the high&#8208;throughput fabrication of microparticles exhibiting pulsatile release. In PULSED, biodegradable polymeric microstructures with an open cavity are formed using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing and soft lithography, filled with drug, and sealed using a contactless heating step in which the polymer flows over the orifice to form a complete shell around a drug&#8208;loaded core. Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) particles with this structure can rapidly release encapsulated material after delays of 10&#177;1, 15&#177;1, 17&#177;2, or 36&#177;1 days in vivo, depending on polymer molecular weight and end group. The system is even compatible with biologics, releasing over 90% of bevacizumab in its bioactive form after a two&#8208;week delay in vitro. The PULSED system is highly versatile, offering compatibility with crystalline and amorphous polymers, easily injectable particle sizes, and compatibility with several newly developed drug loading methods. Together, these results suggest that PULSED is a promising platform for creating long&#8208;acting drug formulations that improve patient outcomes due to its simplicity, low cost, and scalability.

         <title>Nonepitaxial electrodeposition of (002)&#8208;textured Zn anode on textureless substrates for dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen evolution&#8208;suppressed Zn batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nontoxic and safe aqueous Zn batteries are largely restricted by the detrimental dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution of Zn metal anode. The (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrodeposition, demonstrated as effective approach for solving these issues, is nevertheless achieved mainly by epitaxial or hetero&#8208;epitaxial deposition of Zn on pre&#8208;textured substrates. Herein, we report the electrodeposition of (002)&#8208;textured and compact Zn on textureless substrates (commercial Zn, Cu and Ti foils) at a medium high galvanostatic current density. According to the systematic investigations on Zn nucleation and growth behaviors, this is ascribed to two reasons: (i) the promoted nonepitaxial nucleation of fine horizontal (002) nuclei at increased overpotential and (ii) the competitive growth advantages of (002)&#8208;orientated nuclei. The resulting freestanding (002)&#8208;textured Zn film exhibits significantly suppressed hydrogen evolution and prolonged Zn plating/stripping cycling life, achieving over 2100 mAh cm&#8722;2 cumulative capacity under a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a high depth of discharge (DOD) of 45.5%. Therefore, this study provides both fundamental and practical insights for long&#8208;life Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;A transcytosis-targeting peptide-decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound-induced liposomal reassembly and protein-corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size-transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor-mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10&#160;reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained.

&lt;p&gt;A proof-of-concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate-controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin-information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof-of-concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion-based spintronic devices in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>

         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Engineered Switchable&#8208;Wettability Surfaces for Multi&#8208;Path Directional Transportation of Droplets and Subaqueous Bubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface featured by switchable wettability is proposed to achieve the multi&#8208;path parallel directional transportation of both water droplets and subaqueous bubbles. This programmable, easy&#8208;fabricable, highly&#8208;efficient, and cost&#8208;effective fluidic system with strong robustness against structural defects is ready for versatile fluid transportation supporting both liquid&#8208; and gas&#8208;phase matters.








Abstract
Conventional engineered surfaces for fluid manipulation are hindered by the set wettability, and thus they can only achieve spontaneous transport of single&#8208;phase fluid, namely liquid or gas. Moreover, fluid transport systems that are robust to path defects have yet to be fully explored. Here, unprecedentedly, a universal wettability switching strategy is developed for achieving programmable directional transport of both droplets and subaqueous bubbles on a dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface (DPFS), featuring in strong robustness, high efficiency, and effective cost. By tuning the superwettability of DPFS through octadecyltrichlorosilane treatment and ultraviolet&#8208;C selective irradiation, the transport fluid can alternate between liquid and gas. The material's switchable superwettability regulates the fluid directed dynamics within the confined pattern, in which the sustaining fluid propelling relies on the surface energy difference between the starting and terminal sites. This enables the construction of multiple channels, which works synergistically with ultralow&#8208;volume&#8208;loss transport to impart the fluidic system with strong robustness against path defects. Underlying the completion of complex microfluidics tasks, spatially&#8208;selective cooling devices and subaqueous gas microreactors are successfully demonstrated. This energy&#8208;consumption&#8208;free fluid transport system opens a new avenue for on&#8208;chip programmable fluid manipulation, promoting innovative applications requiring rational control of two&#8208;phase fluid transport.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High&#8208;Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter-sized scaffold-free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top-down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D-bioprinting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked Hole Conductor Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.9% Efficiency</title>

A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV.








Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photogalvanic Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking layer number&#8208;dependent electron structure, quantum properties, and circularly (linearly) polarized photogalvanic effect are assessed in the low&#8208;dimensional dual topological superlattices (TSLs) (Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&#8722;1 cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

     alt="Single-Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme-catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate-recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor-specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom (Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme-like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single-atom and axial N coordination, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SA. At tumor sites, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)-like and peroxidase (POD)-like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can also generate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through catalase (CAT)-like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)-like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate-cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme-mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

Organic Metal Halide Hybrids
Efficient electroluminescent devices can now be fabricated using solution&#8208;processed thin films based on 0D organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs). In article number 2209417, Biwu Ma and co&#8208;workers develop a highly luminescent 0D OMHH containing organic semiconducting cations, which successfully addresses the issues of low conductivity and poor energy alignment of existing 0D OMHHs for electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

Aerogel Anodes
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed by Yujie Li, Jingxin Zhao, Bingang Xu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2209886 to fabricate a highly aligned aerogel anode with MXene and Zn powder (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8211;P). Benefitting from the combined induction of laminar flow and ice crystals in the 3DCEP process, MXene and Zn&#8211;P can be arranged in the Zn anode to achieve a unique Zn&#8208;dendrite inhibition effect.

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.

         <title>Non&#8208;equilibrium&#8208;Growing Aesthetic Ionic Skin for Fingertip&#8208;Like Strain&#8208;Undisturbed Tactile Sensation and Texture Recognition</title>

Abstract
Humans use periodically ridged fingertips to precisely perceive the characteristics of objects via ion&#8208;based fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;adaptive mechanotransduction. However, designing artificial ionic skins with fingertip&#8208;like tactile capabilities remains challenging because of the contradiction between structural compliance and pressure sensing accuracy (e.g., anti&#8208;interference from stretch and texture recognition). Inspired by the formation and modulus&#8208;contrast hierarchical structure of fingertips, we introduce an aesthetic ionic skin grown from a non&#8208;equilibrium Liesegang patterning process. This ionic skin with periodic stiff ridges embedded in a soft hydrogel matrix enables strain&#8208;undisturbed triboelectric dynamic pressure sensing as well as vibrotactile texture recognition. By coupling with another piezoresistive ionogel, we further fabricate an artificial tactile sensory system as a soft robotic skin to mimic the simultaneous fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;adaptive multimodal sensations of fingers in grasping actions. Our approach may inspire the future design of high&#8208;performance ionic tactile sensors for intelligent applications in soft robotics and prosthetics.

         <title>Enabling 420&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells by Lanthanum Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal plane regulation strategy for lithium&#160;(Li)&#8208;metal anodes is reported by in&#160;situ&#160;lanthanum (La) doping. La&#8208;doped Li metal enables a preferred crystal plane change to (200) from (110) plane, thereby decreasing the reactivity of Li metal toward electrolytes and establishing a stable interface. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries are achieved under realistic conditions.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#160;metal, a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries, typically grows along the low&#8208;surface energy (110) plane in the plating process, resulting in uncontrollable dendrite growth and unstable interface. Herein, an unexpected Li growth behavior by lanthanum (La) doping is reported: the preferred orientation turns to (200) from (110) plane, enabling 2D nuclei rather than the usual 1D nuclei upon Li deposition and thus forming a dense and dendrite&#8208;free morphology even at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Noticeably, La doping further decreases the reactivity of Li metal toward electrolytes, thereby establishing a stable interface. The dendrite&#8208;free, stable Li anode enables a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.30% at 8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 for asymmetric Li||LaF3&#8211;Cu cells. A 3.1&#160;Ah LaF3&#8211;Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell at a high energy density (425.73&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) with impressive cycling stability (0.0989% decay&#160;per&#160;cycle) under lean electrolyte (1.76&#160;g&#160;Ah&#8722;1) and high cathode loading (5.77&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) using this doped Li anode is further demonstrated.

         <title>Reconfigurable Electrical Networks within a Conductive Hydrogel Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft conductors coupled with reversible electrical conductivity can enable new functions in wearable electronics and soft robotics. In&#160;this&#160;work, a reconfigurable conductive hydrogel composite is developed, which is made of silver flakes, polyacrylamide, and alginate hydrogel. By simply applying dehydration and rehydration treatments, the material can achieve reversible electrical conductivity. This reconfigurability can help the material to recover from severe damage or control locomotion of a legged robot.








Abstract
Soft materials that exhibit compliance, programmability, and reconfigurability can have a transformative impact as electronic skin for applications in wearable electronics/soft robotics. There has been significant progress in soft conductive materials; however, achieving electrically&#160;controlled and reversible changes in conductivity and circuit connectivity remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, a&#160;soft material architecture with reconfigurable conductive networks of silver flakes embedded within a hydrogel matrix is presented. The conductive networks can be reversibly created/disconnected through various stimuli, including current, humidity, or temperature. Such stimuli affect electrical connectivity of the hydrogel by controlling its water content, which can be modulated by evaporation under ambient conditions (passive dehydration), evaporation through electrical Joule heating (active dehydration), or absorption of additional water (rehydration). The resulting change in electrical conductivity is reversible and repeatable, endowing the composite with on&#8208;demand reconfigurable conductivity. To highlight this material's unique properties, it is shown that conductive traces can be reconfigured after severe damage and revert to lower conductivity after rehydration. Additionally, a quadruped robot is demonstrated that can respond to stimuli by changing direction following exposure to excess water, thereby achieving reprogrammable locomotion behaviors.

         <title>Mass Production of Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with highly active M&#63743;N4&#63743;S sites is successfully fabricated in a sustainable and large&#8208;scale manner by utilizing a by&#8208;product of the papermaking industry (i.e., lignosulfonate) as a multifunctional bioligand. The resulting SAC exhibits enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reactions catalytic performance and shows high durability in Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs); however, scalable production of SACs from sustainable resources is difficult owing to poor control of the local coordination environment. Herein, lignosulfonate, a by&#8208;product of the papermaking industry, is utilized as a multifunctional bioligand for the mass production of SACs with highly active M&#63743;N4&#63743;S sites (M represents Fe, Cu, and Co) via strong metal&#63743;nitrogen/sulfur coordination. This effectively adjusts the charge distribution and promotes the catalytic performance, leading to highly durable and excellent performance in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for ZABs. This study paves the way for the industrial production of cost&#8208;effective SACs in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Bistable Joints Enable the Morphing of Hydrogel Sheets with Multistable Configurations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active joints are designed by using a stiff gel as a frame and a responsive gel as an actuating unit. The response mismatch in the joint with in&#8208;plane gradient leads to folding or twisting with the feature of bistability. Integration of multiple joints into one hydrogel enables the formation of multistable configurations that facilitate designs of hydrogel devices with versatile functions.








Abstract
Joints, as a flexing element to connect different parts, are widespread in natural systems. Various joints exist in the body and play crucial roles to execute gestures and gaits. These scenarios have inspired the design of mechanical joints with passive, hard materials, which usually need an external power supply to drive the transformations. The incorporation of soft and active joints provides a modular strategy to devise soft actuators and robots. However, transformations of responsive joints under external stimuli are usually in uni&#8208;mode with a pre&#8208;determined direction. Here, hydrogel joints capable of folding and twisting transformation in bi&#8208;mode are reported, which enable the composite hydrogel to form multiple configurations under constant conditions. These joints have an in&#8208;plane gradient structure and comprise stiff, passive gel as the frame and soft, active gel as the actuating unit. Under external stimuli, the response mismatch between different gels leads to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane folding or twisting deformation with the feature of bistability. These joints can be modularly integrated with other gels to afford complex deformations and multistable configurations. This approach favors selective control of hydrogel's architectures and versatile design of hydrogel devices, as demonstrated by proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. It shall also merit the development of metamaterials, soft actuators, and robots, etc.

         <title>Engineering Human Brain Assembloids by Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microfluidic system is presented for the spatially controlled patterning of human&#8208;brain region&#8208;specific organoids, allowing for the efficient, scalable, and flexible generation of brain assembloids. Therefore, this microfluidic system has remarkable potential in wide applications of assembloid technology in neurological and biomedical fields.








Abstract
Brain assembloids offer a highly promising strategy to model human brain development and disease, and advance potential studies in regenerative medicine, therapeutic screening, and drug discovery, while it is challenging to produce uniform brain organoids and assemble them flexibly by conventional methods. Here, a multidisciplinary engineered strategy to generate human brain assembloids with desired patterning based on microfluidic technology&#160;is presented. By encapsulating human induced pluripotent stem cells in microcapsules via microfluidic electrospray, brain region&#8208;specific organoids are efficiently formed, which are then introduced into a microfluidic chip consisting of a bottom layer with a micropillar array and a movable upper layer with a complementary microhole array. These brain organoids can settle into microholes and fuse into brain assembloids. As varied organoid microcapsules with designed 1D sequences or 2D arrays can be assembled into the vertical microholes, large coding amounts of fused brain assembloids with desired patterning can be produced. It is found that brain assembloids composed of cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic organoids can grow and function well, characterized with active neural migration and interaction. These features indicate that the suggested flexible, scalable, and controlled microfluidic systems are remarkably potential in wide applications of brain assembloids in neurological and biomedical fields.

         <title>Optimizing the Pd Sites in Pure Metallic Aerogels for Efficient Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst design strategy is demonstrated for the optimization of Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By diminishing the Pd&#63743;Pd coordination, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs are constructed in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel, which are further fine&#8208;tuned to achieve an excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production.








Abstract
Decentralized electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive alternative to the industrial anthraquinone process, the application of which is hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts in acidic media. Herein, a novel catalyst design strategy is reported to optimize the Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By increasing the Hg content in the Pd&#63743;Hg aerogels, the Pd&#63743;Pd coordination is gradually diminished, resulting in isolated, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel. Further heterometal doping leads to a series of M&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogels with an unalterable geometric environment, allowing for sole investigation&#160;of&#160;the electronic effects. Combining theoretical and experimental analyses, a volcano relationship is obtained for the M&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogels, demonstrating an effective tunability of the electronic structure of the Pd active sites. The optimized Au&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogel exhibits an outstanding H2O2 selectivity of 92.8% as well as transferred electron numbers of &#8776;2.1 in the potential range of 0.0&#8211;0.4 VRHE. This work opens a door for designing metallic aerogel electrocatalysts for H2O2 production and highlights the importance of electronic effects in tuning electrocatalytic performances.

         <title>Nonlocal Cable&#8208;Network Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; reconfigurable metamaterial platform based on standard coaxial cables and bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors is proposed. Particularly, interesting nonlocal effects can be straightforwardly implemented through coupling unit cells via coaxial cables to their beyond nearest neighbors. Metamaterials with nonlocal interactions from 2nd order to 6th order are assembled and highly unusual dispersion relations than with only local interactions are experimentally demonstrated.








Abstract
Metamaterials are artificial materials in which the atoms of ordinary solids are replaced by tailored functional building blocks. Therefore, previous work has emphasized tailoring the inside of the building blocks, for example, by exploiting local resonances, to realize unusual effective metamaterial properties. However, the wave properties of a metamaterial are not only determined by its building blocks but also by the interactions between these building blocks. Here, reconfigurable &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; electromagnetic metamaterials are introduced for which the building blocks are essentially trivial standard bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors and the effective metamaterial properties are solely achieved by tailoring the local and especially the nonlocal interactions mediated by standard coaxial cables. Unprecedented dispersion relations of the lowest band with multiple regions of slow waves and backward waves are demonstrated. Importantly, the dispersion relation of such metamaterials dominated by nonlocal interactions is not limited by the principle of causality in the same way as for metamaterials designed by local resonances of building blocks.

         <dc:description>
Since leukocytes actively participate in cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases, leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems have attracted much attention in recent years. Herein, recent progress and future perspectives in macrophage&#8208;, neutrophil&#8208;, and lymphocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems, as well as their combination with other treatments (immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and photodynamic therapy) are reviewed, highlighting promising drug delivery strategies to treat cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Leukocytes play a vital role in immune responses, including defending against invasive pathogens, reconstructing impaired tissue, and maintaining immune homeostasis. When the immune system is activated in vivo, leukocytes accomplish a series of orderly and complex regulatory processes. While cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases like sepsis are critical medical difficulties plaguing humankind around the world, leukocytes have been shown to largely gather at the focal site,&#160;and significantly contribute to&#160;inflammation and cancer progression. Therefore, the living leukocyte&#8208;based&#160;drug delivery systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to the innate and specific targeting effect, low immunogenicity, improved therapeutic efficacy, and low reverse effect. In this review, the recent advances in the development of living leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems including macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes as promising treatment strategies for cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases are introduced. The advantages, current challenges, and limitations of these delivery systems are also discussed, as well as perspectives on the future development of precision and targeted therapy in the clinics are provided. Collectively, it is expected that such kind of living cell&#8208;based drug delivery system is promising to improve or even revolutionize the treatments of cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases in the clinics.

         <title>A&#160;pH&#8208;Activatable Copper&#8208;Biomineralized Proenzyme for Synergistic Chemodynamic/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy against Aggressive Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxidase&#8208;like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH&#8208;NCs) are&#160;found&#160;to&#160;act as a pH&#8208;activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor&#8208;selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against aggressive triple&#8208;negative breast cancers (TNBCs).








Abstract
Artificial enzymes have demonstrated therapeutic benefits against diverse malignant tumors, yet their antitumor potencies are still severely compromised by non&#8208;selective catalysis, low atomic&#8208;utilization efficiency, and undesired off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, it is reported that peroxidase&#8208;like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH&#8208;NCs) act as a pH&#8208;activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor&#8208;selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against aggressive triple&#8208;negative breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH&#8208;NCs show pH&#8208;sensitive Cu2+ release, which spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated reduction into Cu+ species for catalyzing the evolution of H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH)&#160;in a single&#8208;atom&#8208;like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously activates non&#8208;toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell apoptosis. CuCH&#8208;NCs exhibit considerable tumor&#8208;targeting capacity with deep penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast tumors&#160;through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo safety. Moreover, CuCH&#8208;NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with relieving immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and high&#8208;performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.

         <title>Polaritons in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of 2D material polaritons in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is reviewed from the perspective of design principles and potential applications. Some fundamental properties of polaritons in vdWHs are initially discussed, followed by recent discoveries of plasmons, phonon polaritons, exciton polaritons, and their hybrid modes in vdWHs.








Abstract
2D monolayers supporting a wide variety of highly confined plasmons, phonon polaritons, and exciton polaritons can be vertically stacked in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with controlled constituent layers, stacking sequence, and even twist angles. vdWHs combine advantages of 2D material polaritons, rich optical structure design, and atomic scale integration, which have greatly extended the performance and functions of polaritons, such as wide frequency range, long lifetime, ultrafast all&#8208;optical modulation, and photonic crystals for nanoscale light. Here, the state of the art of 2D material polaritons in vdWHs from the perspective of design principles and potential applications is reviewed. Some fundamental properties of polaritons in vdWHs are initially discussed, followed by recent discoveries of plasmons, phonon polaritons, exciton polaritons, and their hybrid modes in vdWHs. The review concludes with a perspective discussion on potential applications of these polaritons such as nanophotonic integrated circuits, which will benefit from the intersection between nanophotonics and materials science.

         <title>Ultrasmooth and Dense Lithium Deposition Toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmooth and dense lithium &#160;deposition is achieved by ingenious synergy of vertically aligned nanosheet arrays and ultrathin Li2S&#8208;rich solid&#160;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Specifically, nanosheet arrays possess the proper surface area to reduce local current density and avoid excessive side reactions. Moreover, moveable Li2S&#8208;rich SEI with electronically insulating properties can homogenize lithium&#8208;ion flux and inhibit electron escape to avoid electrolyte decomposition.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with stable solid&#160;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendrite&#8208;free formation have great potential in next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Here, vertically aligned 3D Cu2S nanosheet arrays are&#160;fabricated&#160;on the surface of commercial Cu foils, which in&#160;situ generate ultrathin Cu nanosheet arrays to reduce local current density and Li2S layers on the surfaces to work as an&#160;excellent artificial SEI. It is found that Li presents a 3D&#8208;to&#8208;planar deposition model, and Li2S layers are reversibly movable between the&#160;3D nanosheet surface and 2D planar surface of Li during long&#8208;term cycling. This enables ultrasmooth and dense Li deposition at 1&#160;mA cm&#8208;2, presenting an average thickness of &#8776;53.0&#160;&#181;m at 10 mAh cm&#8208;2, which is close to the theoretical Li foil thickness and is highly reversible at different cycles. Thus, 1150 stable cycles with high Coulombic efficiency (CE, 99.1%) at ether&#8208;based electrolytes and 300 stable cycles with high CE (98.8%) at carbonate electrolytes are realized in half&#8208;cell with a capacity of 1 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2. When coupled with commercial cathodes (LiFePO4 or LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2), the full cells present substantially enhanced cyclability under high cathode loading, limited (or zero) Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions, even at &#8722;20 &#176;C.

         <title>A&#160;Wafer&#8208;Scale Nanoporous 2D Active Pixel Image Sensor Matrix with High Uniformity, High Sensitivity, and Rapid Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive and robust active&#8208;matrix image sensor circuitry is demonstrated by integrating a wafer&#8208;scale nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) phototransistor array with high&#8208;performance indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) switching transistors. A 4&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale 2D)MoS2 is synthesized and a periodic nanopore array is created on its surface to achieve exceptionally high photoresponsivity of 5.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. The device shows a technically advanced form based on large&#8208;area 2D material similar to a commercialized complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor consisting of a sensor and a driving transistor in the matrix pixel.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have&#160;been successfully developed as novel ubiquitous optoelectronics owing to their excellent electrical and optical characteristics. However, active&#8208;matrix image sensors based on TMDs have limitations owing to the difficulty of fabricating large&#8208;area integrated circuitry and achieving high optical sensitivity.

     alt="A&#160;Wafer-Scale Nanoporous 2D Active Pixel Image Sensor Matrix with High Uniformity, High Sensitivity, and Rapid Switching"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasensitive and robust active-matrix image sensor circuitry is demonstrated by integrating a wafer-scale nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) phototransistor array with high-performance indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) switching transistors. A 4-inch wafer-scale 2D)MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is synthesized and a periodic nanopore array is created on its surface to achieve exceptionally high photoresponsivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The device shows a technically advanced form based on large-area 2D material similar to a commercialized complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor consisting of a sensor and a driving transistor in the matrix pixel.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have&#160;been successfully developed as novel ubiquitous optoelectronics owing to their excellent electrical and optical characteristics. However, active-matrix image sensors based on TMDs have limitations owing to the difficulty of fabricating large-area integrated circuitry and achieving high optical sensitivity. Herein, a large-area uniform, highly sensitive, and robust image sensor matrix with active pixels consisting of nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) phototransistors and indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO) switching transistors is reported. Large-area uniform 4-inch wafer-scale bilayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films are synthesized by radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and sulfurization processes and patterned to be a nanoporous structure consisting of an array of periodic nanopores on the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface via block copolymer lithography. Edge exposure on the nanoporous bilayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induces the formation of subgap states, which promotes a photogating effect to obtain an exceptionally high photoresponsivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A 4-inch-wafer-scale image mapping is successively achieved using this active-matrix image sensor by controlling the device sensing and switching states. The high-performance active-matrix image sensor is state-of-the-art in 2D material-based integrated circuitry and pixel image sensor applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;small Nano&#8208;assemblies as Tumor&#8208;targeted and Renal Clearable Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Abstract
It is a challenge to design photosensitizers to balance between the tumor&#8208;targeting enrichment for precise treatment and efficient clearance within a reasonable timescale for reducing side effects. Herein, we report an ultra&#8208;small nano&#8208;photosensitizer 1a with excellent tumor&#8208;specific accumulation and renal clearance. It was formed from the self&#8208;assembly of compound 1 bearing three TEG arms and two pyridinium groups in water. The positively charged surface with neutral TEG coating enables 1a to efficiently target the tumor, with the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio reaching as high as 11.5 after tail intravenous injection. The ultra&#8208;small size of 1a with an average diameter of 5.6&#160;nm allows its fast clearance through kidney. Self&#8208;assembly also endows 1a with an 18.2&#8208;fold enhancement of ROS generation rate compared to compound 1 in organic solution. Nano&#8208;PS 1a manifests an excellent PDT efficacy on tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. This work provides a promising design strategy of photosensitizers with renal clearable and tumor&#8208;targeting ability.

         <title>Phage Display Screening as a Rational Approach to Design Additives for Selective Crystallization Control in Construction Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The design of additives showing strong and selective interactions with certain target surfaces is key to crystallization control in applied reactive multicomponent systems. While suitable chemical motifs can be found through semi&#8208;empirical trial&#8208;and&#8208;error procedures, bioinspired selection techniques offer a more rationally driven approach and explore a much larger space of possible combinations in a single assay. Here we use phage display screening to characterize the surfaces of crystalline gypsum, a mineral of broad relevance for construction applications. Based on next&#8208;generation sequencing of phages enriched during the screening process, we identify a triplet of amino acids, DYH, as main driver for adsorption on the mineral substrate. Furthermore, oligopeptides containing this motif prove to exert their influence in a strictly selective manner during the hydration of cements, where the sulfate reaction (initial setting) is strongly retarded while the silicate reaction (final hardening) remains unaffected. In a final step, these desired additive characteristics are successfully translated from the level of peptides to that of scalable synthetic copolymers. The approach described in this work demonstrates how modern biotechnological methods can be leveraged for the systematic development of efficient crystallization additives for materials science.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Manganese Atoms Stabilized on Ceria for Nitrous Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
N2O exhibits unique reactivity in oxidation catalysis, but the high manufacturing costs limit its prospective uses. Direct oxidation of NH3 to N2O can ameliorate this issue but its implementation is thwarted by suboptimal catalyst selectivity and stability, and the lack of established structure&#8208;performance relationships. Systematic and controlled material nanostructuring offers an innovative approach for advancement in catalyst design. Herein we discover low&#8208;valent manganese atoms stabilized on ceria, CeO2, as the first stable catalyst for NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two&#8208;fold higher productivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Detailed mechanistic, computational and kinetic studies reveal CeO2 as the mediator of oxygen supply, while undercoordinated manganese species activate O2 and facilitate N2O evolution via N&#8208;N bond formation between nitroxyl, HNO, intermediates. Synthesis via simple impregnation of a small metal quantity (1&#160;wt.%) predominantly generates isolated manganese sites, while full atomic dispersion is achieved upon redispersion of sporadic oxide nanoparticles during reaction, as confirmed by advanced microscopic analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, manganese speciation is maintained, and no deactivation is observed over 70&#160;h on stream. CeO2&#8208;supported isolated transition metals emerge as a novel class of materials for N2O production, encouraging future studies to evaluate their potential in selective catalytic oxidations at large.

         <title>Vanadium Oxide&#8208;Doped Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Multi&#8208;Parameter Sensor to Decouple Soil Nitrogen Loss and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly porous 3D vanadium oxide&#8208;doped laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide&#8208;doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self&#8208;assembled films. The resulting foam composite provides a high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;parameter sensor to completely decouple nitrogen oxides and temperature, allowing for accurate detection of nitrogen loss and soil temperature for precision agriculture.








Abstract
Monitoring nitrogen utilization efficiency and soil temperature in agricultural systems for timely intervention is essential for crop health&#160;with reduced environmental pollution. Herein, this work presents a high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;parameter sensor based on vanadium oxide (VOX)&#8208;doped laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) foam to completely decouple nitrogen oxides (NOX) and temperature. The highly porous 3D VOX&#8208;doped LIG foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide (V5S8)&#8208;doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self&#8208;assembled films. The heterojunction formed at the LIG/VOX interface provides the sensor with enhanced response to NOX and an ultralow limit of detection of 3 ppb (theoretical estimate of 451 ppt) at room temperature. The sensor also exhibits a wide detection range, fast response/recovery, good selectivity, and stability over 16 days. Meanwhile, the sensor can accurately detect temperature over a wide linear range of 10&#8211;110&#160;&#176;C. The encapsulation of the sensor with a soft membrane further allows for temperature sensing without being affected by NOX. The unencapsulated sensor operated at elevated temperature removes the influences of relative humidity and temperature variations for accurate NOX measurements. The capability to decouple nitrogen loss and soil temperature&#160;paves the way for the development of future multimodal decoupled electronics for precision agriculture and health monitoring.

Abstract
Multiresonance (MR) molecules generally face spectral broadening issues with red&#8208;shifted emissions. Thus, green emitters with full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of &lt;20&#160;nm are rarely reported, despite being highly desired. Herein, by properly fusing indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ) and naphthalene moieties, we report on green MR emitters with FWHMs of merely 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV) and 14&#160;nm (0.069&#160;eV) in dichloromethane, accompanied by high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;95%, which represent not only the smallest FWHMs among all green MR emitters but also the first green emitters based on ICZ MR derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that the orbital interactions between the antisymmetric sites of the segments play an important role in extending the conjugation length in the fusion architectures while simultaneously maintaining a small FWHM. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit green emission peaks at 508&#8211;509&#160;nm and the first green electroluminescence FWHM of &lt;20&#160;nm ever reported. Benefiting from the preferential horizontal dipole orientation, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 30.9% was obtained, which remained at 28.9% and 23.2% under luminances of 1,000&#160;cd/m2 and 10,000&#160;cd/m2, respectively, outperforming most reported green devices based on narrowband emitters.

         <title>Electrostatic epitaxy of orientational perovskites for microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline structures is pivotal in semiconductor industry, which is achievable by epitaxy for producing thin films, heterostructures, quantum wells and superlattices. Beyond silicon and III&#8208;V semiconductors, solution&#8208;processible semiconductors, such as metal&#8208;halide perovskites, are emerging for scalable and cost&#8208;effective manufacture of optoelectronic devices, whereas the polycrystalline nature of fabricated structures restricts their application towards integrated devices. Here, we develop electrostatic epitaxy, a process sustained by strong electrostatic interactions between self&#8208;assembled surfactants (octanoate anions) and Pb2+, to realize orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 microwires. Strong electrostatic interactions localized at air&#8208;liquid interface not only support preferential nucleation for single crystallinity, but also select the crystal facet with the highest Pb2+ areal density for pure crystallographic orientation. Due to the epitaxy at air&#8208;liquid interface, we realize direct growth of oriented single&#8208;crystalline microwires onto different substrates without the processes of lift&#8208;off and transfer. Photonic lasing emission, waveguide coupling and on&#8208;chip propagation of coherent light are demonstrated based on these single&#8208;crystalline microwires. Our findings open an avenue for on&#8208;chip integration of single&#8208;crystalline materials.

         <title>Recent Progress in Colloidal Quantum Dot Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconducting colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) represent an emerging class of thermoelectric materials for use in a wide range of future applications. CQDs combine solution processability at low temperatures with the potential for upscalable manufacturing via printing techniques. Moreover, due to their low dimensionality, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and a high density of grain boundaries, which can be independently exploited to tune the Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity, respectively. This unique combination of attractive attributes makes CQDs very promising for application in emerging thermoelectric generator (TEG) technologies operating near room temperature. Herein, we review recent progress in CQDs for application in emerging thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics. We start by outlining the fundamental concepts of thermoelectricity in nanostructured materials, followed by an overview of the popular synthetic methods used to produce CQDs with controllable size and shape. Recent strides in CQD&#8208;based thermoelectrics are then discussed with particular emphasis on their application in thin&#8208;film TEGs. Finally, we highlight the current challenges and future perspectives in enhancing the performance of CQD&#8208;based thermoelectric materials for use in emerging applications.

         <title>Dihydroxyterephthalate &#8211; a Trojan Horse PET Counit for Facile Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here we&#160;demonstrate low&#8208;energy PET chemical recycling in water: PET copolymers with diethyl 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalate (DHTE) undergo selective hydrolysis at DHTE sites, autocatalyzed by neighboring group participation (NGP). Liberated oligomeric subchains further hydrolyze until only small molecules remain. Poly(ethylene terephthalate&#8208;stat&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalate) (PEDHT) copolymers were&#160;synthesized via melt polycondensation and then hydrolyzed in 150&#8211;200 &#176;C water with 0&#8211;1 wt % ZnCl2, or alternatively in simulated sea water. Degradation progress followed pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics. With increasing DHTE loading, the rate constant increased monotonically while the thermal activation barrier decreased. The depolymerization products were&#160;ethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid, and bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalate dimer, which could be used to regenerate virgin polymer. Composition&#8208;optimized copolymers showed a decrease of nearly 50% in the Arrhenius activation energy, suggesting a 6&#8208;order reduction in depolymerization time under ambient conditions compared to that of PET homopolymer. This study provides new insight to the design of polymers for end&#8208;of&#8208;life while maintaining key properties like service temperature and mechanical properties. Moreover, this chemical recycling procedure is more environmentally friendly compared to traditional approaches since water is the only needed material, which is green, sustainable, and&#160;cheap.

         <title>Electronic/Optoelectronic Memory Device Enabled by Tellurium&#8208;based 2D van der Waals Heterostructure for in&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing at the Optical Communication Band</title>

Abstract
Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been widely explored for data storage and neuromorphic computing, the construction of 2D material&#8208;based memory devices with optoelectronic responsivity in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region for in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) at the optical communication band still remains a big challenge. In this work, we report an electronic/optoelectronic memory device enabled by tellurium&#8208;based 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure, where the ferroelectric CuInP2S6 and tellurium channel endow this device with both the long&#8208;term potentiation/depression by voltage pulses and short&#8208;term potentiation by 1550&#8208;nm laser pulses (a typical wavelength in the conventional fiber optical communication band). Leveraging the rich dynamics, we demonstrate a fully memristive in&#8208;sensor RC system that can simultaneously sense, decode and learn messages transmitted by optical fibers. The reported 2D vdW heterostructure&#8208;based memory featuring both the long&#8208;term and short&#8208;term memory behaviors using electrical and optical pulses in SWIR region has not only complemented the wide spectrum of applications of 2D materials family in electronics/optoelectronics but also paves the way for future smart signal processing systems at the edge.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Conductive gels toward Underwater Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conductive gels have been developing vigorously as superior wearable sensing materials due to their intrinsic conductivity, softness, stretchability and biocompatibility, showing a great potential in many aspects of our lives. However, compared to their wide application on land, it is significant yet rather challenging for traditional conductive gels to realize sensing application under water. The swelling of gels and the loss of conductive components in the aqueous environment, resulted from the diffusion across the interface, lead to structural instability and sensing performance decline. Fortunately, great efforts have been devoted to improving the water resistance of conductive gels and employing them in the field of underwater wearable sensing in recent years, and some exciting achievements have been obtained, which are of great significance for promoting the safety and efficiency of underwater activities. However, there has been no review to thoroughly summarize the underwater sensing application of conductive gels. This review presents a brief overview of the representative design strategies for developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels and their diversified applications in the underwater sensing field as wearable sensors. Finally, the ongoing challenges for further developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels for underwater wearable sensing are also discussed along with recommendations for the future.

         <title>In Situ Transformable Nanoplatforms with Supramolecular Crosslinking Triggered Complementary Function for Enhanced Cancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In vivo crosslinking of nanoparticles is widely used to increase accumulation of therapeutic agents at tumor site for enhanced therapy. However, the components in nanoplatforms usually only play for one role and are independent of each other, unable to amplify their biofunctions. Herein, a complementary functioning tumor microenvironment triggered, supramolecular coordination induced nanoparticle crosslinking strategy is constructed for enhanced photodynamic therapy. Manganese oxide (MnOx) and polyhydroxy photosensitizer hypericin (Hyp) are coated and loaded onto lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to form transformable UCNP@MnOx&#8208;Hyp. In CT26 mouse colon cancer cells and xenograft tumors, UCNP@MnOx&#8208;Hyp is reduced by glutathione (GSH) and H2O2, releasing Mn2+ and Hyp for in situ crosslinking to transform to UCNP@Mn2+&#8208;Hyp. Compared to the simple photosensitizer loaded UCNP@PEI&#8208;Hyp, the Mn2+&#8208;Hyp coordination redshifts absorbance of hypericin and improves the energy transfer efficiency from UCNPs to Hyp (5.6&#8208;fold). In turn, the supramolecular coordination induced UCNPs crosslinking exhibits enhanced luminescence recovery and increased intracellular accumulation of both UCNPs and Hyp, thus enhancing the photodynamic therapy efficacy both at cellular level (2.1&#8208;fold) and in vivo, realizing the function amplification of each component after responsive transformation and offering a new avenue for enhanced cancer therapy.

Abstract
The sense of spiciness is related to the stimulation of vanilloid compounds contained in the foods. Although, the spiciness is commonly considered as the part of taste, it is more classified to the sense of pain stimulated on a tongue, namely, pungency, which is described as a tingling or burning on the tongue. Herein, w e firstly fabricated a reusable electronic tongue based on a TRPV1 nanodisc conjugated graphene field&#8208;effect transistor and demonstrated spiciness&#8208;related pain evaluation with reusable electrode. The pungent compound reactive receptor TRPV1 w as synthesized in the form of nanodiscs to maintain stability and reusability. O ur newly developed platform showed highly selective and sensitive performance towards each spiciness related vanilloid compound repeatably: 1 aM capsaicin, 10 aM dihydrocapsaicin, 1 fM piperine, 10&#160;nM allicin, and 1 pM AITC. The binding mechanism w as also examined by simulation. Furthermore, the elimination of the burning sensation on the tongue after eating spicy foods w as not investigated. Based on the synthesis of micelles composed of casein protein (which is contained in skim milk) that remove pungent compounds bound to TRPV1 nanodisc, the deactivation of TRPV1 w as investigated, and the electrode w as reusable that mimicking electronic tongue.

         <title>Engineering Pore Environments of Sulfate&#8208;pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation with Record Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineering pore environments exhibits great potential in improving gas adsorption and separation performances but requires specific means for acetylene/carbon dioxide (C2H2/CO2) separation due to their identical dynamic diameters and similar properties. Herein, we report a novel sulfate&#8208;pillared MOF adsorbent (SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl) ethene (TEPE) ligand with dense electronegative pore surfaces. Compared to the prototype SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn exhibits a higher C2H2 uptake (89.1 cm3 g&#8722;1), meanwhile the CO2 uptake reduces to 14.1 cm3 g&#8722;1, only 17.4% of that on SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn (81.0 cm3 g&#8722;1). The high affinity toward C2H2 than CO2 is demonstrated by the benchmark C2H2/CO2 selectivity (16833). Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm its application feasibility and good cyclability at various flow rates. During the desorption cycle, 60.1 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5% purity or 33.2 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.99% purity can be recovered by stepped purging and mild heating. The simulated pressure swing adsorption processes reveal that 75.5 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5+% purity with a high gas recovery of 99.82% can be produced in a counter&#8208;current blowdown process. Modeling studies disclose four favorable adsorption sites and dense packing for C2H2.

         <title>Discovery of Topological Magnetic Textures Near room Temperature in Quantum Magnet TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The study of topology in quantum materials has fundamentally advanced our understanding in condensed matter physics and potential applications in next&#8208;generation quantum information technology. Recently, the discovery of a topological Chern phase in the spin&#8208;orbit coupled Kagome lattice TbMn6Sn6 has attracted considerable interest. Whereas these phenomena highlight the contribution of momentum space Berry curvature and Chern gap on the electronic transport properties, less is known about the intrinsic real space magnetic texture, which is crucial for understanding the electronic properties and further exploring the unique quantum behavior. Here, we directly observe the stabilization of topological magnetic skyrmions in TbMn6Sn6 using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L&#8208;TEM) near room temperature, where the spins experience full spin reorientation transition (SRT) between the a and c axes. We construct an effective spin Hamiltonian based on the Ginzburg&#8208;Landau theory and perform micromagnetic simulation to clarify the critical role of Ruderman&#8208;Kittel&#8208;Kasuya&#8208;Yosida (RKKY) interaction on the stabilization of skyrmion lattice. Our results not only uncover non&#8208;trivially spin topological texture in TbMn6Sn6, but also provide a solid basis to study its interplay with electronic topology.

         <title>Molecular tuning of a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide supramolecular fibrous hydrogel enables control over viscoelasticity and creates tunable ECM&#8208;mimetic hydrogels and bioinks</title>

Abstract
Hydrogels are an important class of materials for applications in cell culture and tissue engineering; however, traditional synthetic covalent hydrogels lack the native tissue dynamics and hierarchical fibrous structure found in the extracellular matrix (ECM). These dynamic and fibrous nanostructures have been shown to be imperative in obtaining the correct cell/material interactions, and thus critical for biomedical applications. Consequently, the challenge to engineer functional dynamics in a fibrous hydrogel and recapitulate native ECM properties remains a bottle&#8208;neck to biomimetic hydrogel environments for cell culture. In this study, we report the molecular tuning of a self&#8208;assembling, supramolecular benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator via simple modulation of hydrophobic substitutents. This tuning resulted in fibrous hydrogels with accessible viscoelasticity over 5 orders of magnitude, while maintaining a constant equilibrium storage modulus. Using recently developed synthetic methodology, we created BTA hydrogelators with 12, 16, 18, 20 and 24 external hydrophobic carbon atoms, and observed that the hydrophobics controlled the viscoelasticity and stress relaxation time scales in a logarithmic fashion. The BTA hydrogels with 16, 20, and 24 hydrophobic carbons were shear&#8208;thinning, self&#8208;healing, extrudable, injectable, and could be 3D printed into multiple layers. These hydrogels showed high cell viability for chondrocytes and hMSCs, establishing their use in tissue engineering applications. This simple molecular tuning by changing hydrophobicity (with just a few carbon atoms) provides precise control over the viscoelasticity and 3D printability in fibrillar hydrogels and could be ported onto other 1D self&#8208;assembling structures. The molecular control and design of hydrogel network dynamics can push the field of supramolecular chemistry towards designing new ECM&#8208;mimicking hydrogelators for numerous cell culture and tissue engineering applications and give access towards highly biomimetic bioinks for bioprinting.

         <title>Sunlight Stimulated Photochemical Self&#8208;Healing Polymers Capable of Re&#8208;Bonding Damages up to a Centimeter Below the Surface Even Out of the Reach of the Illumination</title>

         <dc:description>
Sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing polymers capable of remending cracks up to a centimeter deep based on long&#8208;range free radicals transfer mechanism are developed by the incorporation of photo&#8208;sensitive dithiocarbamate units. Furthermore, record&#8208;high mechanical properties are acquired as compared with the reported photo&#8208;reversible polymers.









The development of photochemical self&#8208;healing polymers faces the the following bottlenecks: i) only the surface cracks can be restored and ii) materials&#8217; mechanical properties are lower. To break these bottlenecks, cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;dithiocarbamate)s carrying photo&#8208;reversible dithiocarbamate bonds covalently linked to indole chromophores and benzyl groups are designed. The conjugated structure of the chromophore and benzyl enhances the addition reactivity of thiocarbonyl moiety and facilitates photo&#8208;cleavage of C&#63743;S bond, so that transfer of the created radicals among dithiocarbamate linkages is promoted. Accordingly, reshuffling of the reversibly cross&#8208;linked networks via dynamic exchange between the activated dithiocarbamates is enabled in both surface layer and the interior upon exposure to the low&#8208;intensity ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun. It is found that the damages up to a centimeter below the surface can be effectively recovered in the sunshine, which greatly exceeds the maximum penetration distance of UV light (hundreds of microns). Besides, tensile strength and failure strain of the poly(urethane&#8208;dithiocarbamate) are superior to the reported photo&#8208;reversible polymers, achieving the record&#8208;high 33.8 MPa and 782.0% owing to the wide selectivity of soft/hard blocks, multiple interactions, and appropriate cross&#8208;linking architecture. The present work provides a novel paradigm of photo self&#8208;healing polymers capable of re&#8208;bonding cracks even out of the reach of the illumination.

         <title>An Advanced Strategy to Enhance TENG Output: Reducing Triboelectric Charge Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains difficult in technology to enhance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) output performance if only promoting the triboelectric charge generation, because the optimal TENG output performance is theoretically decided by the dynamic equilibrium during vitally triboelectric charge between generation and decay. To break this bottleneck, this review outlines the strategy of reducing triboelectric charge decay to enhance TENG output.








Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to accelerate the construction of smart cities. However, it requires more than 30 billion sensors to realize the IoT vision, posing great challenges and opportunities for industries of self&#8208;powered sensors. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), an emerging new technology, is capable of easily converting energy from surrounding environment into electricity, thus TENG has tremendous application potential in self&#8208;powered IoT sensors. At present, TENG encounters a bottleneck to boost output for large&#8208;scale commercial use if just by promoting triboelectric charge generation, because the output is decided by the triboelectric charge dynamic equilibrium between generation and decay. To break this bottleneck, the strategy of reducing triboelectric charge decay to enhance TENG output is focused. First, multiple mechanisms of triboelectric charge decay are summarized in detail with basic theoretical principles for future research. Furthermore, recent advances in reducing triboelectric charge decay are thoroughly reviewed and outlined in three aspects: inhibition and application of air breakdown, simultaneous inhibition of air breakdown and triboelectric charge drift/diffusion, and inhibition of triboelectric charge drift/diffusion. Finally, challenges and future research focus are proposed. This review provides reference and guidance for enhancing TENG output.

         <title>Thermal Transport Properties of Phonons in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the experimental and theoretical research of the thermal transport properties of halide perovskites since 2016. The microscopic behaviors of phonons are discussed along with the nonphononic descriptions. Also, the recent trends of the halide perovskites for thermal&#8208;related applications are presented.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for various applications, such as photovoltaic, optoelectronic and thermoelectric applications. The knowledge of the thermal transport of halide perovskites is essential for enhancing the device performance for these applications and improving the understanding of heat transport in complicated material systems with atomic disorders. In this work, the current understanding of the experimentally and theoretically obtained thermal transport properties of halide perovskites is reviewed. This study comprehensively examines the reported thermal conductivity of methylammonium lead iodide, which is a prototype material, and provides theoretical frameworks for its lattice vibrational properties. The frameworks and discussions are extended to other halide perovskites and derivative structures. The implications for device applications, such as solar cells and thermoelectrics, are discussed.

         <title>Bioengineered 3D Skeletal Muscle Model Reveals Complement 4b as a Cell&#8208;Autonomous Mechanism of Impaired Regeneration with Aging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic skeletal muscle aging model&#160;is&#160;presented that recapitulates age&#8208;related declines in muscle function and regeneration while resembling the responses of aged muscle to therapeutic treatments. Using the developed muscle aging model, complement component 4b inhibition is identified as a novel approach to improve aged muscle repair.








Abstract
A mechanistic understanding of cell&#8208;autonomous skeletal muscle changes after injury can lead to novel interventions to improve functional recovery in an aged population. However, major knowledge gaps persist owing to limitations of traditional&#160;biological aging models. 2D cell culture represents an artificial environment, while aging mammalian models are contaminated by influences from non&#8208;muscle cells and other organs. Here, a 3D muscle aging system is created to overcome the limitations of these traditional platforms. It is shown that old muscle constructs (OMC) manifest a sarcopenic phenotype, as evidenced by hypotrophic myotubes, reduced contractile function, and decreased regenerative capacity compared to young muscle constructs. OMC also phenocopy the regenerative responses of aged muscle to two interventions, pharmacological and biological. Interrogation of muscle cell&#8208;specific mechanisms that contribute to impaired regeneration over time further reveals that an aging&#8208;induced increase of complement component 4b (C4b) delays muscle progenitor cell amplification and impairs functional recovery. However, administration of complement factor I, a C4b inactivator, improves muscle regeneration in vitro and in vivo, indicating that C4b inhibition may be a novel approach to enhance aged muscle repair. Collectively, the model herein exhibits capabilities to study cell&#8208;autonomous changes in skeletal muscle during aging, regeneration, and intervention.

         <title>Water Spider&#8208;Inspired Nanofiber Coating with Sustainable Scale Repellency via Air&#8208;Replenishing Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by water spiders, an underwater superaerophilic nanofiber coating is developed to display excellent and sustainable scalephobic capability. Through appropriate replenishment, air film on the coating can be well stabilized and serves as a barrier layer to reduce the deposition of scale. Compared with reported results, the water spider&#8208;inspired coating significantly surpasses them in both longevity and efficiency.








Abstract
To survive underwater even in severely hypoxic water for a long period, the&#160;water spider has to periodically collect and replenish air into the diving bell. Inspired by this natural air&#8208;replenishing strategy, a water spider&#8208;inspired nanofiber (WSN) coating with underwater superaerophilicity displaying excellent and sustainable scalephobic capability is prepared. Air film on the WSN coating can be well&#8208;kept and further employed as the barrier layer for scale repellence. Significantly, scalephobic capability of the WSN coating mainly originates from two aspects: inhibiting interfacial nucleation and reducing interfacial adhesion of scale. Compared with previous studies, this WSN coating achieves excellent and sustainable scale repellence (&#8776; 98% reduction in scale deposition) even after a one&#8208;month dynamic scaling test. Thus, this air&#8208;replenishing strategy may raise a new avenue for advanced long&#8208;term scalephobic materials.

         <title>The Negative&#8208;Charge&#8208;Triggered &#8220;Dead Zone&#8221; between Electrode and Current Collector Realizes Ultralong Cycle Life of Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A stable, lightweight, durable, and low&#8208;cost current collector, MXene (Ti3C2Tx) film, is achieved for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. A large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups are incorporated onto the surface of the MXene film to form rich negative charges region on its surface, which shields the positive electrode material from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation in its &#8220;dead zone.&#8221;








Abstract
Typically, volume expansion of the electrodes after intercalation of active ions is highly undesirable yet inetvitable, and it can significantly reduce the adhesion force between the electrodes and current collectors. Especially in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), the intercalation of large&#8208;sized AlCl4&#8722; can greatly weaken this adhesion force and result in the detachment of the electrodes from the current collectors, which seems an inherent and irreconcilable problem. Here, an interesting concept, the &#8220;dead zone&#8221;, is presented to overcome the above challenge. By incorporating a large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups onto the surface of MXene film, a rich negative&#8208;charge region is formed on its surface. When used as the current collector for AIBs, it shields a tiny area of the positive electrode (adjacent to the current collector side) from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation due to the repulsion force, and a tiny inert layer (dead zone) at the interface of the positive electrode is formed, preventing the electrode from falling off the current collector. This helps to effectively increase the battery's cycle life to as high as 50&#160;000 times. It is believed that the proposed concept can be an important reference for future development of current collectors in rocking chair batteries.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured Inorganic Materials with Optical Chiral Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of chiral mesostructured inorganic materials and their optical chiral response is emerging as a remarkably active area and full of challenges and opportunities. Recent advances in experiments and the mechanistic origin of the optical chiral response are reviewed. A fabrication strategy for the realization of chiral structures in inorganic materials with achiral space groups is briefly presented.








Abstract
Fabricating chiral inorganic materials and revealing their unique quantum confinement&#8208;determined optical chiral responses are crucial tasks in the multidisciplinary fields of chemistry, physics, and biology. The field of chiral mesostructured inorganic materials started from the synthesis of individual nanocrystals and evolved to include their assembly from metals, semiconductors, ceramics, and inorganic salts endowed with various chiral structures ranging from atomic to micron scales. This tutorial review highlights the recent research on chiral mesostructured inorganic materials, especially the novel expression of mesostructured chirality and endowed optical chiral response, and it may inspire us with new strategies for the design of chiral inorganic materials and new opportunities beyond the traditional applications of chirality. Fabrication methods for chiral mesostructured inorganic materials are classified according to chirality type, scale, and symmetry&#8208;breaking mechanism. Special attention is given to highlight systems with original discoveries, exceptional phenomena, or unique mechanisms of optical chiral response for left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness.

         <title>Orthogonal Photochemistry toward Direct Encryption of a 3D&#8208;Printed Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encryption on a 3D hydrogel is achieved by orthogonal photochemistry. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;based 3D printing can fabricate hydrogels into complex geometries, and the further UV irradiation is employed to encode the information on the gel surface. This strategy for product anti&#8208;counterfeiting with high security paves the way for more reliable encryption.








Abstract
Encryption technologies are essential for information security and product anti&#8208;counterfeiting, but they are typically restricted to planar surfaces. Encryption on complex 3D objects offers great potential to further improve security. However, it is rarely achieved owing to the lack of encoding strategies for nonplanar surfaces. Here, an approach is reported to directly encrypt on a 3D&#8208;printed object employing orthogonal photochemistry. In this system, visible light photochemistry is used for 3D printing of a hydrogel, and ultraviolet light is subsequently employed to activate its geometrically complex surface through the dissociation of ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester units in a spatioselective manner for information coding. This approach offers a new way for more reliable encryption, and the underlying orthogonal photochemistry can be extended toward functional modification of 3D&#8208;printed products beyond information protection.

         <title>Synaptic Resistor Circuits Based on Al Oxide and Ti Silicide for Concurrent Learning and Signal Processing in Artificial Intelligence Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic resistor (synstor) circuit concurrently executes signal processing and learning in real time to fly drones toward a target in an aerodynamically changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the environment significantly superior to an artificial neural network on computers, providing a path to establish power&#8208;efficient intelligent systems in the capriciously mutable real world.








Abstract
Neurobiological circuits containing synapses can process signals while learning concurrently in real time. Before an artificial neural network (ANN) can execute a signal&#8208;processing program, it must first be programmed by humans or trained with respect to a large and defined data set during learning processes, resulting in significant latency, high power consumption, and poor adaptability to unpredictable changing environments. In&#160;this&#160;work, a crossbar circuit of synaptic resistors (synstors) is reported, each synstor integrating a Si channel with an Al oxide memory layer and Ti silicide Schottky contacts. Individual synstors are characterized and analyzed to understand their concurrent signal&#8208;processing and learning abilities. Without any prior training, synstor circuits concurrently execute signal processing and learning in real time to fly drones toward a target position in an aerodynamically changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the environment significantly superior to an ANN running on computers. The synstor circuit provides a path to establish power&#8208;efficient intelligent systems with real&#8208;time learning and adaptability in the capriciously mutable real world.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Gas System for Promoted Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis on Porous Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional gas&#8208;in&#8208;solvent reaction systems for photocatalytic nitrogen reduction suffer from unsatisfactory activity, since the overwhelming protic solvent severely hinders the nitrogen transfer and causes strong competing hydrogen evolution. In this work, a novel &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;gas&#8221; system, which enables direct operation of photocatalyst under a nitrogen gas&#8208;dominated environment with limited proton source, is designed to fundamentally solve the above problem.








Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) is emerging as a sustainable ammonia synthesis approach to meet global carbon neutrality. Porous framework materials with well&#8208;designed structures have great opportunities in PNRR; however, they suffer from unsatisfactory activity in the conventional gas&#8208;in&#8208;solvent system (GIS), owing to the hindrance of nitrogen utilization and strong competing hydrogen evolution caused by overwhelming solvent. In this study, porous framework materials are combined with a novel &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;gas&#8221; system, which can bring their superiority into full play. This system enables photocatalysts to directly operate in a gas&#8208;dominated environment with a limited proton source uniformly suspended in it, achieving the accumulation of high&#8208;concentrated nitrogen within porous framework while efficiently restricting the solvent&#8208;photocatalyst contact. An over eightfold increase in ammonia production rate (1820.7 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) compared with the conventional GIS and an apparent quantum efficiency as high as &#8776;0.5% at 400 nm are achieved. This system&#8208;level strategy further finds applicability in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring it as a staple for photosynthetic methodology.

Abstract
Recently, the newly&#8208;emerging lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskite counterparts. Among them, ternary copper halides (TCHs) have become a vital group due to their unique features, including abundant structural diversity, ease of synthesis, unprecedented optoelectronic properties, high abundance, and low cost. Although the recent efforts in this field have made certain progresses, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Herein, a comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent progress on the fundamental characteristics of TCH materials and their versatile applications is presented, which contains topics such as: i) crystal and electronic structure features and synthesis strategies; ii) mechanisms of self&#8208;trapped excitons, luminescence regulation, and environmental stability; and iii) their burgeoning optoelectronic devices of phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), electroluminescent LEDs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, X&#8208;ray scintillators, photodetectors, sensors, and memristors. Finally, the current challenges together with future perspectives on the development of TCH materials and applications are also critically described, which is considered to be critical for accelerating the commercialization of these rapidly evolving technologies.

         <title>Geometric Tuning of Single&#8208;Atom FeN4 Sites via Edge&#8208;Generation Enhances Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are considered promising alternatives to natural enzymes. The catalytic performance of SAzymes featuring homogeneous, well&#8208;defined active structures can be enhanced through elucidating structure&#8208;activity relationship and tailoring physicochemical properties. However, manipulating enzymatic properties through structural variation is an underdeveloped approach. Herein, we report on the synthesis of edge&#8208;rich Fe single&#8208;atom nanozymes (FeNC&#8208;edge) via an H2O2&#8208;mediated edge generation. By controlling the number of edge sites, the peroxidase (POD)&#8208; and oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like performance is significantly enhanced. The activity enhancement results from the presence of abundant edges, which provide new anchoring sites to mononuclear Fe. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FeN4 moieties in the edge sites display high electron density of Fe atoms and open N atoms. Finally, we demonstrate that FeNC&#8208;edge nanozyme effectively inhibits tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that edge&#8208;tailoring is an efficient strategy for developing artificial enzymes as novel catalytic therapeutics.

         <title>Engineering of Chain Rigidity and Hydrogen Bond Cross&#8208;Linking toward Ultra&#8208;Strong, Healable, Recyclable and Water&#8208;Resistant Elastomers</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance elastomers have gained significant interest because of their wide applications in industry and our daily life. However, it remains a great challenge to fabricate elastomers simultaneously integrating ultra&#8208;high mechanical strength, toughness, and excellent healing and recycling capacities. In this study, ultra&#8208;strong, healable, and recyclable elastomers are fabricated by dynamically cross&#8208;linking copolymers composed of rigid polyimide (PI) segments and soft poly (urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) segments with hydrogen bonds. The elastomers, which are denoted as PI&#8208;PUU, have a record&#8208;high tensile strength of &#8764;142&#160;MPa and an extremely high toughness of &#8764;527&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. The structure of the PI&#8208;PUU elastomer contains hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;cross&#8208;linked elastic matrix and homogenously dispersed rigid nanostructures. The rigid PI segments self&#8208;assemble to generate phase&#8208;separated nanostructures that serve as nanofillers to significantly strengthen the elastomers. Meanwhile, the elastic matrix is composed of soft poly (urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) segments cross&#8208;linked with reversible hydrogen bonds, which largely enhance the strength and toughness of the elastomer. The dynamically cross&#8208;linked PI&#8208;PUU elastomers can be healed and recycled to restore their original mechanical strength. Moreover, because of the excellent mechanical performance and the hydrophobic PI segments, the PI&#8208;PUU elastomers are scratch&#8208;, puncture&#8208; and water&#8208;resistant.

         <title>Bioinspired hierarchical self&#8208;assembled nanozyme for efficient antibacterial treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Along with the rapid development and ever&#8208;deepening understanding of nanoscience and nanotechnology, nanomaterials hold promise to mimic the highly evolved biological exquisite nanostructures and sophisticated functions. Here, inspired by the ubiquitous antibacterial nanostructures on the wing&#160;surfaces&#160;of&#160;some insects, we develop a NiCo2O4 nanozyme with self&#8208;adaptive hierarchical nanostructure that can capture bacteria of various morphotypes via the physico&#8208;mechanical interaction between the nanostructure and bacteria. Moreover, the developed biomimetic nanostructure further exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity, which can catalytically generate highly toxic reactive oxygen species that disrupt bacterial membranes and induce bacterial apoptosis. Therefore, the mechano&#8208;catalytic coupling property of this NiCo2O4 nanozyme allows for an extensive and efficient antibacterial application, with no concerns of antimicrobial resistance. This work suggests a promising strategy for the rational design of advanced antibacterial materials by mimicking biological antibiosis.

         <title>Recent Advances and Challenges of Colloidal Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Display Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit tremendous potential in display technologies owing to their unique optical properties, such as size&#8208;tunable emission wavelength, narrow spectral linewidth, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Significant efforts in academia and industry have achieved dramatic improvements in the performance of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) over the past decade, primarily owing to the development of high&#8208;quality QDs and optimized device architectures. Moreover, sophisticated patterning processes have also been developed for QDs, which is an essential technique for their commercialization. As a result of these achievements, some QD&#8208;based display technologies, such as QD enhancement films and QD&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, have been successfully commercialized, confirming the superiority of QDs in display technologies. However, despite these developments, the commercialization of QLEDs is yet to reach a threshold, requiring a leap forward in addressing challenges and related problems. Thus, we review representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication methods to specify the current status and development direction. Furthermore, we provide brief insights into the factors to be considered when conducting research on single&#8208;device QLEDs to realize active matrix displays. This review guides the way toward the commercialization of QLEDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accommodation Induced Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction on Ruthenium Site for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tuning the metal&#8208;support interaction of supported metal catalysts has been found to be the most effective approach to modulating electronic structure and improving catalytic performance. But practical understanding of the charge transfer mechanism at the electronic level of catalysis process has remained elusive. Here, we report that ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles can self&#8208;accommodate into Fe3O4 and carbon support (Ru&#8208;Fe3O4/C) through the electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, resulting in robust catalytic activity towards the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Spectroscopic evidence and theoretical calculations demonstrate that electronic perturbation occurred in the Ru&#8208;Fe3O4/C, and that charge redistribution directly influenced adsorption behavior during the catalytic process. The Ru&#8208;O bond formed by orbital mixing changes the charge state of the surface Ru site, enabling more electrons to flow to H intermediates (H*) for favorable adsorption. The weak binding strength of the Ru&#8208;O bond also reinforces the anti&#8208;bonding character of H* with more favorable recombination of H* species into H2 molecules. Because of this satisfactory catalytic mechanism, the Ru&#8208;Fe3O4/C supported nanoparticle catalyst demonstrated better HER activity and robust stability than the benchmark commercial Pt/C benchmark in alkaline media.

         <title>Flexible Organic Transistors for Biosensing: Devices and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible and stretchable biosensors can offer seamless and conformable biological&#8208;electronic interfaces for continuously acquiring high&#8208;fidelity signals, permitting numerous emerging applications. Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are ideal transducers for flexible and stretchable biosensing due to their soft nature, inherent amplification function, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization, low cost, and device diversity. In consideration of the rapid advances in flexible OTFT&#8208;based biosensors and their broad applications, herein, we provide a timely and comprehensive review. We start with a detailed introduction to the features of various OTFTs including organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), and the functionalization strategies for biosensing, with a highlight on the seminal work and up&#8208;to&#8208;date achievements. Then, we detail the applications of flexible OTFT&#8208;based biosensors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces. Subsequently, special attention is paid to emerging stretchable organic transistors including planar and fibrous devices. The routes to impart stretchability, including structural engineering and material engineering, are discussed, and the implementations of stretchable organic transistors in e&#8208;skin and smart textiles are included. Finally, we summarize the remaining challenges and the future opportunities in this field.

         <title>Future Research Directions in Perovskite Solar Cells: Exquisite Photon Management and Thermodynamic Phase Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light management to maximize external luminescence efficiency and photon absorptivity and methodology for enthalpy&#8208;driven thermodynamic phase stability are future research directions toward extremely efficient and stable perovskite solar cells approaching theoretical power conversion efficiency.








Abstract
As power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly increased up to 25.7% in 2022, a curiosity about the achievable limit of the PCE has prevailed and demands understanding about the underlying fundamentals to step forward. Meanwhile, outstanding long&#8208;term stability of PSCs over 1000&#160;h has been reported at operating conditions or under damp heat test with 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity. Herein comes the question as to whether the phase stability issue of perovskite crystal is completely resolved in the most recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite film or if it deceives everyone into believing so by significantly slowing the kinetics. On the one hand, the fundamental origins of a discrepancy between reported values and the theoretical limit are thoroughly examined, where the importance of light management is greatly emphasized with the introduction of external luminescence as a key parameter to narrow the gap. On the other hand, the phase stability of a perovskite film is understood from thermodynamic point of view to address viable approaches to lower the Gibbs free energy, distinguishing the kinetically trapped condition from the thermodynamically stable phase.

         <title>Photoallosteric Polymersomes toward On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery and Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Allosteric transitions can modulate the self&#8208;assembly and biological function of proteins. It remains, however, tremendously challenging to design synthetic allosteric polymeric assemblies with spatiotemporally switchable hierarchical structures and functionalities. Here, we construct a photoallosteric polymersome that undergoes a rapid conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. In addition to improving nanoparticle cell penetration and lysosome escape, photoinduced allosteric behavior reconstructs the vesicular membrane structure, which stimulates the release of hydrophilic cytolytic peptide melittin and hydrophobic kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Combining on&#8208;demand delivery of multiple therapeutics with phototherapy results in apoptosis and immunogenic death of tumor cells, remolds the immune microenvironment and achieves an excellent synergistic anticancer efficacy in vivo without tumor recurrence and metastasis. Such a light&#8208;modulated allosteric transition in non&#8208;photosensitive polymers provides new insight into the development of smart nanomaterials for biosensing and drug delivery applications.

         <title>Construction of Fluorinated Propane&#8208;Trap in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Record Polymer&#8208;Grade Propylene Production under High Humidity Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the incorporation of &#63743;CF3 groups into the confined pore space, the constructed fluorinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit benchmark C3H8/C3H6 separation potential with strong C3H8 binding affinity over C3H6 and exceptional C3H8 uptake capacity. Moreover, the MOFs exhibit high hydrophobicity and good moisture stability, indicating potential applications in efficient C3H8/C3H6 separation under actual conditions with vapour.








Abstract
Propane/propene (C3H8/C3H6) separation is essential in the petrochemical industry but challenging because of their similar physical and chemical properties. Adsorptive separation with C3H8&#8208;selective porous materials can energy&#8208;efficiently produce high&#8208;purity C3H6, which is highly promising for replacing conventional cryogenic distillation but suffers from unsatisfactory performance. Herein, through the precise incorporation of fluorinated functional groups into the confined pore space, a new fluorinated metal&#8211;organic framework&#160;(FDMOF&#8208;2) featuring the unique and strong C3H8&#8208;trap is successfully constructed. FDMOF&#8208;2 exhibits an unprecedented C3H8 capture capacity of 140 cm3 cm&#8722;3 and excellent C3H8/C3H6 (1:1, v/v) selectivity up to 2.18 (298 K and 1&#160;bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported porous materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that the tailored pore confinement in FDMOF&#8208;2 provides stronger and multiple attractive interactions with C3H8, enabling excellent binding affinities. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that C3H8 can be directly extracted from various C3H8/C3H6 mixtures with FDMOF&#8208;2, affording an outstanding C3H6 production (501&#160;mmol L&#8722;1) with over 99.99% purity. Benefiting from the robust framework and hydrophobic ligands, the separation performance of FDMOF&#8208;2 can be well maintained even under 70% relative humidity conditions.

         <title>P&#8208;Type 2D Semiconductors for Future Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D semiconductors represent one of the most promising candidates to extend Moore's law. However, their full potential has been greatly hindered by the limited p&#8208;type ones with high performance and stability. This review offers a comprehensive discussion of the fundamentals, current status, and outlook of p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors, aiming to inspire relevant research for advanced future electronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors represent one of the best candidates to extend Moore's law for their superiorities, such as keeping high carrier mobility and remarkable gate&#8208;control capability at atomic thickness. Complementary transistors and van der Waals junctions are critical in realizing 2D semiconductors&#8208;based integrated circuits suitable for future electronics. N&#8208;type 2D semiconductors have been reported predominantly for the strong electron doping caused by interfacial charge impurities and internal structural defects. By contrast, superior and reliable p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors with holes as majority carriers are still scarce. Not only that, but some critical issues have not been adequately addressed, including their controlled synthesis in wafer size and high quality, defect and carrier modulation, optimization of interface and contact, and application in high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power integrated devices. Here the material toolkit, synthesis strategies, device basics, and digital electronics closely related to p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors are reviewed. Their opportunities, challenges, and prospects for future electronic applications are also discussed, which would be promising or even shining in the post&#8208;Moore era.

         <title>Powder Metallurgy Route to Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Refractory Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sintering refractory metals/alloys to high density while maintaining fine microstructure is of paramount importance to ensure their applications. A comprehensive understanding of the sintering issues and microstructural design rules is discussed. Powder metallurgy advances in specific materials systems, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), and refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys and their composites are reviewed.








Abstract
Ultrafine&#8208;grained (UFG) refractory metals are promising materials for applications in aerospace, microelectronics, nuclear energy, and many others under extreme environments. Powder metallurgy (PM) allows to produce such materials with well&#8208;controlled chemistry and microstructure at multiple length scales and near&#8208;net shape manufacturing. However, sintering refractory metals to full density while maintaining a fine microstructure is still challenging due to the high sintering temperature and the difficulty to separate the kinetics of densification versus grain growth. Here an overview of the sintering issues, microstructural design rules, and PM practices towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals are sought to be provided. The previous efforts shall be reviewed to address the processing challenges, including the use of fine/nanopowders, second&#8208;phase grain growth inhibitors, and field&#8208;assisted sintering techniques. Recently, pressureless two&#8208;step sintering has been successfully demonstrated in producing dense UFG refractory metals down to &#8776;300&#160;nm average grain size with a uniform microstructure and this technological breakthrough shall be reviewed. PM progresses in specific materials systems shall be next reviewed, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys, and their composites. Last, future developments and the endeavor towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals with exceptionally uniform microstructure and improved properties are outlined.

         <title>Substitutional p&#8208;Type Doping in NbS2&#8211;MoS2 Lateral Heterostructures Grown by MOCVD</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type NbS2&#8211;MoS2 lateral heterostructures with a high on/off current ratio are synthesized by a&#160;one&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method with Nb dopants present in the&#160;monolayer MoS2. The heterostructure provides a platform to explore the instructive interface of substitutional doped TMDC materials and 2D metal&#8211;semiconductor heterojunctions, which paves a prospective way to designing innovative nanoscale devices and complementary&#160;metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#160;(CMOS)&#8208;like 2D circuits.








Abstract
Monolayer MoS2 has attracted significant attention owing to its excellent performance as an n&#8208;type semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) family. It is however strongly desired to develop controllable synthesis methods for 2D p&#8208;type MoS2, which is crucial for complementary logic applications but remains difficult. In this work, high&#8208;quality NbS2&#8211;MoS2 lateral heterostructures are synthesized by one&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) together with monolayer MoS2 substitutionally doped by Nb, resulting in a p&#8208;type doped behavior. The heterojunction shows a p&#8208;type transfer characteristic with a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;104, exceeding previously reported values. The band structure through the NbS2&#8211;MoS2 heterojunction is investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and quantum transport simulations. This work provides a scalable approach to synthesize substitutionally doped TMDC materials and provides an insight into the interface between 2D metals and semiconductors in lateral heterostructures, which is imperative for the development of next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics and highly integrated devices.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Fabrication of Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based membranes, featuring potential molecular sieving effects and therefore capable of surmounting the ubiquitous trade&#8208;off between membrane selectivity and permeability, hold great promise for multitudinous chemical separations. Nevertheless, it remains highly challenging for the large&#8208;area fabrication of ultrathin MOF membranes with variable thickness, great homogeneity, and preferential orientation. We herein report the facile fabrication of ultrathin (down to 20&#160;nm) NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large&#8208;area (&gt; 200 cm2) yet with great homogeneity and texture along (00l) direction due to the superior solution processability of the as&#8208;synthesized NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes with good adhesion properties and certain flexibility exhibit excellent rejections (&gt; 98% for Mg2+ and Al3+, and dyes with molecular weights larger than 585.5 g&#183;mol&#8722;1) toward aqueous separation of various metal ions and dyes at modest permeance (1&#8208;3.2 L&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;bar&#8722;1) due to the well&#8208;aligned structures. Such separation performance outstands among polymetric membranes, thin&#8208;film composite membranes, mixed matrix membranes, and other MOF membranes reported in the literature. The separation mechanism was reasonably discussed based on the experimental and theoretical results. This study opens up novel perspectives for preparing ultrathin and large&#8208;area MOF membranes using the solution processability of MOFs.

         <title>Printable Perovskite Diodes for Broad Spectrum Multi&#8208;Energy X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multi&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray detection is critical to effectively differentiate materials in a variety of diagnostic radiology and non&#8208;destructive testing applications. Silicon and selenium X&#8208;ray detectors are the most common for multi&#8208;energy detection; however, these present poor energy discrimination across the broad X&#8208;ray spectrum and exhibit limited spatial resolution due to the high thicknesses required for radiation attenuation. Here we introduce an X&#8208;ray detector based on solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film metal halide perovskite that overcomes these challenges. By harnessing an optimised n&#8208;i&#8208;p diode configuration, we achieve operation across a broad range of soft and hard X&#8208;ray energies stemming from 0.1 to 10's of keV. Through detailed experimental and simulation work, it is shown that optimised Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskites effectively attenuate soft and hard X&#8208;rays, while also possessing excellent electrical properties to result in X&#8208;ray detectors with high sensitivity factors that exceed 5&#215;103 &#956;CGyVac&#8722;1cm&#8722;2${\rm{\mu CGy}}_{{\rm{Vac}}}^{ - 1}{\rm{cm}}^{ - 2}$ and 6 &#215; 104&#8197;&#956;CGy&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 within soft and hard X&#8208;ray regimes, respectively. Harnessing the solution&#8208;processable nature of the perovskites, we also demonstrate roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printable X&#8208;ray detectors on flexible substrates.

         <title>Record High Electron Mobility Exceeding 16 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in Bisisoindigo&#8208;Based Polymer Semiconductor with a Fully Locked Conjugated Backbone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer semiconductors with mobilities exceeding 10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, especially ambipolar and n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors, are still rare, although they are of great importance for fabricating polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) toward commercial high&#8208;grade electronics. Herein, we designed and synthesized two novel donor&#8722;acceptor copolymers PNFFN&#8208;DTE and PNFFN&#8208;FDTE based on the electron&#8208;deficient bisisoindigo (NFFN) and electron&#8208;rich dithienylethylenes (DTE or FDTE). The copolymer PNFFN&#8208;DTE containing NFFN and DTE possesses a partially locked polymeric conjugated backbone whereas PNFFN&#8208;FDTE containing NFFN and FDTE own a fully locked one. Fluorine atoms in FDTE not only induce the formation of additional CH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;F hydrogen bonds but also lower frontier molecular orbitals for PNFFN&#8208;FDTE. Both PNFFN&#8208;DTE and PNFFN&#8208;FDTE formed more ordered molecular packing in thin films prepared from a polymer solution in bi&#8208;component solvent containing 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene (DCB) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (with volume ratio of 99.2/0.8) than pure DCB. The two copolymers&#8208;based flexible PFETs exhibited ambipolar charge transport properties. Notably, the bi&#8208;component solvent&#8208;processed PNFFN&#8208;FDTE&#8208;based PFETs afforded a high electron mobility of 16.67 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest electron transport mobility for the PFETs reported so far. We attributed the high electron mobility of PNFFN&#8208;FDTE to its fully locked conjugated backbone, dense molecular packing, and much matched LUMO energy level.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer semiconductors with mobilities exceeding 10 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, especially ambipolar and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type polymer semiconductors, are still rare, although they are of great importance for fabricating polymer field-effect transistors (PFETs) toward commercial high-grade electronics. Herein, we designed and synthesized two novel donor&#8722;acceptor copolymers &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-DTE&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-FDTE&lt;/b&gt; based on the electron-deficient bisisoindigo (&lt;b&gt;NFFN&lt;/b&gt;) and electron-rich dithienylethylenes (&lt;b&gt;DTE&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;FDTE&lt;/b&gt;). The copolymer &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-DTE&lt;/b&gt; containing &lt;b&gt;NFFN&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DTE&lt;/b&gt; possesses a partially locked polymeric conjugated backbone whereas &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-FDTE&lt;/b&gt; containing &lt;b&gt;NFFN&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;FDTE&lt;/b&gt; own a fully locked one. Fluorine atoms in &lt;b&gt;FDTE&lt;/b&gt; not only induce the formation of additional CH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;F hydrogen bonds but also lower frontier molecular orbitals for &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-FDTE&lt;/b&gt;. Both &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-DTE&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-FDTE&lt;/b&gt; formed more ordered molecular packing in thin films prepared from a polymer solution in bi-component solvent containing 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and 1-chloronaphthalene (with volume ratio of 99.2/0.8) than pure DCB. The two copolymers-based flexible PFETs exhibited ambipolar charge transport properties. Notably, the bi-component solvent-processed &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-FDTE&lt;/b&gt;-based PFETs afforded a high electron mobility of 16.67 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the highest electron transport mobility for the PFETs reported so far. We attributed the high electron mobility of &lt;b&gt;PNFFN-FDTE&lt;/b&gt; to its fully locked conjugated backbone, dense molecular packing, and much matched LUMO energy level.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Anisotropic Excitons Reveal Local Spin Chain Directions in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A long&#8208;standing pursuit in materials science is to identify suitable magnetic semiconductors for integrated information storage, processing, and transfer. Van der Waals magnets have brought forth new material candidates for this purpose. Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order, i.e., the exciton photoluminescence intensity diminishes above the N&#233;el temperature. Here, we&#160;find that the polarization of maximal exciton emission rotates locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the AFM order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments. Furthermore, we&#160;suggest defect&#8208;bound states as an alternative exciton formation mechanism that has yet to be explored in NiPS3. Our&#160;supporting evidence includes chemical analysis, excitation power and thickness dependent photoluminescence, and first&#8208;principles calculations. This mechanism for exciton formation is also consistent with the presence of strong phonon side bands. Our&#160;study shows that anisotropic exciton photoluminescence can be used to read out local spin chain directions in antiferromagnets and realize multi&#8208;functional devices via spin&#8208;photon&#160;transduction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Thermochromic Ionogels for Smart Windows with Excellent Environmental and Mechanical Stability, Solar Modulation and Antifogging Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current thermochromic materials used in smart windows still face challenges, such as poor mechanical and environmental stability, unsatisfactory solar modulation capacity, and low transparency. Herein, we report the first self&#8208;adhesive self&#8208;healing thermochromic ionogels with excellent mechanical and environmental stability, antifogging capability, transparency, and solar modulation capability by loading binary ionic liquids (ILs) into rational&#8208;designed self&#8208;healing poly(urethaneurea) with acylsemicarbazide (ASCZ) moieties that have reversible and multiple hydrogen bonds and demonstrate their feasibility as smart windows with reliability and long service life. The self&#8208;healing thermochromic ionogels can switch between transparent and opaque without leakage or shrinkage, by the constrained reversible phase separation of ILs within the ionogels. The ionogels have the highest transparency and solar modulation capability among reported thermochromic materials and such excellent solar modulation capability can be well maintained after undergoing 1000 transitions, stretches, and bends, and storage at &#8208;30&#176;C, 60&#176;C, 90% RH, and vacuum environment for 2 months. The formation of high&#8208;density hydrogen bonds among the ASCZ moieties contributes to the excellent mechanical strength of the ionogels and allows the thermochromic ionogels to spontaneously heal their damages and be fully recycled at room temperature without the loss of thermochromic capabilities.

         <title>Distinct contact scaling effects in MoS2 Transistors revealed with asymmetrical contact measurements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials have great potential for use in future electronics due to their atomically thin nature enabling better scalability. The channel scalability of 2D materials has been thoroughly investigated, confirming their resilience to short&#8208;channel effects. However, the current understanding of contact scaling in 2D devices is inconsistent and&#160;oversimplified. Here we combine physically scaled contacts and asymmetrical contact measurements (ACMs) to investigate the contact scaling behavior in 2D field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). The ACMs directly compare electron injection at different contact lengths while using the exact same MoS2&#160;channel, eliminating channel&#8208;to&#8208;channel variations. Compared to devices with long contact lengths, devices with short contact lengths (scaled contacts) exhibit larger variations, 15% lower drain currents at high drain&#8208;source voltages, and a higher chance of&#160;early saturation and negative differential resistance. Quantum transport simulations show that the transfer length of Ni&#8208;MoS2&#160;contacts can be as short as 5&#160;nm. Importantly, our results suggest that scaled source contacts can limit the drain current, whereas scaled drain contacts do not. Furthermore, we clearly identify that the actual transfer length depends on the quality of the metal&#8208;2D interface. The asymmetrical contact measurements demonstrated here will enable further understanding of contact scaling behavior at various interfaces.

         <title>Specific and Long&#8208;Term Luminescent Monitoring of Hydrogen Peroxide in Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Luminescent monitoring of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors is conducive to understanding metastasis and developing novel therapeutics. The clinical transformation has been obstructed by the limited light penetration depth, toxicity of nano&#8208;probes, and lack of long&#8208;term monitoring modes of up to days or months. We introduced new monitoring modes via specific probes and implantable devices, which can achieve real&#8208;time monitoring with a readout frequency of 0.01 s or long&#8208;term monitoring for months to years. Near&#8208;infrared dye&#8208;sensitized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were fabricated as the luminescent probes, and the specificity to reactive oxygen species was subtly regulated by the self&#8208;assembled monolayers on the surfaces of UCNPs. Combined with the passive implanted system, a 20&#8208;day monitoring of H2O2 in the rat model of ovarian cancer with peritoneal metastasis was achieved, in which the limited light penetration depth and toxicity of nano&#8208;probes were circumvented. The developed monitoring modes show great potential in accelerating the clinical transformation of nano&#8208;probes and biochemical detection methods.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Meet Polymers: From Synthesis Strategies to Healthcare Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been at the forefront of nanotechnological research for the past decade owing to their high porosity, high surface area, diverse configurations, and controllable chemical structures. They are a rapidly developing class of nanomaterials that are predominantly applied in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors, drug delivery, and gas separation, adsorption, and storage. However, the limited functions and unsatisfactory performance of MOFs resulting from their low chemical and mechanical stability hamper further development. Hybridizing MOFs with polymers is an excellent solution to these problems, because polymers&#8212;which are soft, flexible, malleable, and processable&#8212;can induce unique properties in the hybrids based on those of the two disparate components while retaining their individuality. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials. Furthermore, several applications wherein the incorporation of polymers enhances the MOF performance are discussed, such as anticancer therapy, bacterial elimination, imaging, therapeutics, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Finally, insights from the focus of existing research and design principles for mitigating future challenges are presented.

Abstract
The strong reactivity of water in aqueous electrolytes towards metallic zinc (Zn), especially at aggressive operating conditions, remains the fundamental obstacle to the commercialization of aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Here we report a water&#8208;immiscible ionic liquid diluent 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (EmimFSI) that could substantially suppress the water activity of aqueous electrolyte by serving as a &#8220;water pocket&#8221;, enveloping the highly active H2O&#8208;dominated Zn2+ solvates and protecting them from parasitic reactions. During Zn deposition, the cation Emim+ and anion FSI&#8722; function respectively in mitigating the tip effect and regulating the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby favoring a smooth Zn deposition layer protected by inorganic species&#8208;enriched SEI featuring high uniformity and stability. Combined with the boosted chemical/electrochemical stability endowed by the intrinsic merits of ionic liquid, this ionic liquid&#8208;incorporated aqueous electrolyte (IL&#8208;AE) enables the stable operation of Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#183;nH2O cells even at a challenging temperature 60&#176;C (&gt; 85% capacity retention over 400 cycles). Finally, as an incidental but practically valuable benefit, the near&#8208;zero vapor pressure nature of ionic liquid allows the efficient separation and recovery of high&#8208;value components from the spent electrolyte via a mild and green approach, promising the sustainable future of IL&#8208;AE in realizing practical AZMBs.

         <title>Environmentally Stable, Robust, Adhesive and Conductive Supramolecular Deep Eutectic Gels as Ultrasensitive Flexible Temperature Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is essential and of great significance to impart the high mechanical performance, environmental stability, and high sensitivity to the emerging flexible temperature senors. In this work, we design and prepare polymerizable deep eutectic solvent by simply mixing N&#8208;cyanomethyl acrylamide (NCMA) containing an amide group and a cyano group in the same side chain with lithium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (LiTFSI), and obtain supramolecular deep eutectic polyNCMA/LiTFSI gels after polymerization. These supramolecular gels exhibit excellent mechanical performance (a tensile strength of 12.9&#160;MPa and a fracture energy of 45.3&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), strong adhesion force, high temperature responsiveness, self&#8208;healing ability, and shape memory behavior due to the reversible reconstruction ability of amide hydrogen bonds and cyano&#8208;cyano dipole&#8208;dipole interactions in the gel network. In addition, the gels also demonstrate good environmental stability and 3D printability. To verify its application potential as a flexible temperature sensor, the polyNCMA/LiTFSI gel&#8208;based wireless temperature monitor is developed and displays outstanding thermal sensitivity (8.4%/K) over a wide detection range. The preliminarily result also suggests the promising potential of PNCMA gel as a pressure sensor.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 at 4.7&#160;V by Interface Stabilization and Band Structure Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) is widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries for portable devices due to its high volumetric energy density, which is generally charged to 4.3&#160;V. If the cut&#8208;off voltage of LCO is lifted from 4.3&#160;V to 4.7&#160;V, the specific capacity of LCO will increase from 150 to 230 mAh g&#8722;1 with a significant improvement of 53%. However, LCO suffers serious problems of H1&#8208;3/O1 phase transformation, unstable interface between cathode and electrolyte, and irreversible oxygen redox reaction at 4.7&#160;V. Herein, interface stabilization and band structure modification are proposed to strengthen the crystal structure of LCO for stable cycling of LCO at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.7&#160;V. Gradient distribution of magnesium and uniform doping of nickel in Li layers effectively inhibit the harmful phase transition of LCO, while uniform LiMgxNi1&#8208;xPO4 coating on LCO surface stabilizes the LCO&#8208;electrolyte interface to prevent electrolyte decomposition and cobalt dissolution under high delithiation states. Moreover, the decreased band gap improves the electrochemical performance of the modified LCO, and the charge compensation of nickel and phosphorus and fewer electrons occupying the O2p antibonding orbitals jointly suppress oxygen charge deficiency and improve oxygen redox reaction reversibility. As a result, the modified LCO has a high capacity retention of 78% after 200 cycles at 4.7&#160;V in a half cell and 63% after 500 cycles at 4.6&#160;V in a full cell. This work makes the capacity of LCO one step closer to its theoretical specific capacity.

         <title>Walk Ferroelectric Liquid Droplets with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We show that the motion of ferroelectric liquid sessile droplets deposited on a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate. We understand this behavior as due to the coupling between the polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

         <title>Near&#8208; and long&#8208;range electronic modulation of single metal sites to boost CO2 electrocatalytic reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tuning the electronic structure of the active center is effective to improve the intrinsic activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) but the realization of precise regulation remains challenging. Herein, we report a strategy of &#8220;synergistically near&#8208; and long&#8208;range regulation&#8221; to effectively modulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites. Zn&#8208;N4 sites decorated with axial sulfur ligand in the first coordination and surrounded phosphorus atoms in the carbon matrix are successfully constructed in the hollow carbon supports (ZnN4S1/P&#8208;HC). ZnN4S1/P&#8208;HC exhibits excellent performance for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with a Faraday efficiency of CO close to 100%. The coupling of the CO2RR with thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction to replace oxygen evolution reaction in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer can greatly lower the cell voltage by 0.92&#160;V at a current density of 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, theoretically saving 46% of energy consumption. Theoretical calculation reveals that the near&#8208;range regulation with axial thiophene&#8208;S ligand and long&#8208;range regulation with neighboring P atoms can synergistically lead to the increase of electron localization around the Zn sites, which strengthens the adsorption of *COOH intermediate and therefore boosts the CO2RR.

         <title>Melt Electrowriting of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Scaffolds with Programmed Mechanical Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt electrowriting of liquid crystal elastomers is developed to generate ultrafine fibers with built&#8208;in digitally&#160;defined anisotropy. Square lattice&#160;and other more complex scaffolds with structural features and dimensions hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques, as well as mechanical response to temperature, are demonstrated with this technique.








Abstract
Recently, significant advances have been achieved to precisely program the response of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) through extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing techniques; however, important challenges remain, especially when well&#8208;defined scaffolds based on ultrafine fibers are required. Here the melt electrowriting of reactive liquid crystalline inks, leading, after ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;induced crosslinking, to digitally positioned uniform LCE fibers with diameters ranging from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers is presented, which&#160;is&#160;hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques. The electrowriting process induces the preferential alignment of the mesogens parallel to the fiber's axis. Such an alignment, defined by the printing path, determines the mechanical response of the crosslinked material upon stimulation. This manufacturing platform allows the preparation of open square lattice scaffolds with ultrafine fibers (a&#160;few micrometers in diameter), periods as small as 90&#160;&#181;m, and well&#8208;defined morphology. Additionally, the combination of accurate fiber stacking (up to 50 layers) and fiber fusion between layers leads to unprecedented microstructures composed of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio LCE thin walls. The possibility of digitally controlling the printing of fibers allows the preparation complex fiber&#8208;based scaffolds with programmed and reversible shape&#8208;morphing, thus opening new avenues to prepare miniaturized actuators and smart structures for soft robotics and biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Melt electrowriting of liquid crystal elastomers is developed to generate ultrafine fibers with built-in digitally&#160;defined anisotropy. Square lattice&#160;and other more complex scaffolds with structural features and dimensions hardly accessible with conventional extrusion-based printing techniques, as well as mechanical response to temperature, are demonstrated with this technique.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Transient Self&#8208;Organization of TiNx Nano&#8208;Filament Percolated Networks for High Performance Surface&#8208;Mountable Filter Capacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Preparing low&#8208;dimensional conductive nitride&#8208;based hierarchical structures with sub&#8208;10 nm geometric characteristics has been a major challenge. A unique laser&#8208;induced transient self&#8208;organization strategy to rapidly and controllably fabricate ultrafine (diameter: 3&#8211;5 nm) TiNx nano&#8208;filament percolated chaotic fractal networks is presented. The prepared surface&#8208;mountable filter capacitors achieve a record&#8208;breaking volumetric energy density of 9.17 mWh cm&#8722;3 at 120 Hz in an aqueous electrolyte.








Abstract
Filter capacitors (FCs) are substantial for digital circuits and microelectronic devices, and thus more compact FCs are eternally demanded for system miniaturization. Even though microsupercapacitors are broadly regarded as an excellent candidate for future FCs, yet due to the limitation of available electrode materials, the capacitive performance of reported MSCs drops sharply under high&#8208;frequency alternating current. Herein, we&#160;present a unique laser&#8208;induced transient self&#8208;organization strategy, which synergizes pulsed laser energy and multi&#8208;physical field controlled coalescence processes, leading to the rapid and controllable preparation of titanium nitride ultrafine nano&#8208;filaments (diameter &#8776;3&#8211;5 nm) networks. Their chaotic fractal nanoporous structure, superior specific surface area, and excellent conductivity render these nanostructures promising candidates for FCs. Surface&#8208;mounted filter capacitors based on this electrode material exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycle&#8208;life (2 000 000 cycles) with record ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 9.17 mWh cm&#8722;3 at 120 Hz in aqueous electrolyte, displaying advantages in function, size, and integrability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aluminum electrolytic capacitors. The method here provides a versatile toolbox for designing novel nanostructures with intriguing characteristics and insights for developing advanced and miniaturized filter and power devices.

         <title>Scalable Manufacturing of Mechanical Robust Bioinspired Ceramic&#8211;Resin Composites with Locally Tunable Heterogeneous Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a simple bottom&#8208;up assembly approach, nacre&#8208;like ceramic&#8211;resin composites with tunable heterogeneous architectures are scalably manufactured. The composites are designed with a strong and tough nacre&#8208;like main body, and a stiff and hard surface layer bonded by a gradient interlayer to alleviate property mismatch. This structural design achieves an impressive combination of low density and multiple desired mechanical properties.








Abstract
Lightweight structural materials with a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, toughness, and hardness, are highly&#160;desired yet challenging to be artificially fabricated. Biological structural materials, on the other hand, ingeniously integrate multiple mutually exclusive mechanical properties together relying on their hierarchically heterogeneous structures bonded with gradient interfaces. Here, a scalable bottom&#8208;up approach combining continuous nanofiber&#8208;assisted evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly with laminating, pressure&#8208;less sintering and resin infiltration is reported to fabricate bioinspired heterogeneous ceramic&#8211;resin composites with locally&#160;tunable microstructure to fulfill specific properties. A gradient interlayer is&#160;introduced to provide a gradual transition between adjacent heterogeneous layers, effectively alleviating their property mismatch. The optimized heterogeneous nacre&#8208;like composite, as a demonstration, exhibits an attractive combination of low density (&#8776;2.8&#160;g&#160;cm&#8722;3), high strength (&#8776;292&#160;MPa), toughness (&#8776;6.4&#160;MPa&#160;m1/2), surface hardness (&#8776;1144 kgf&#160;mm&#8722;2) and impact&#8208;resistance, surpassing the overall performance of engineering alumina. This material&#8208;independent approach paves the way for designing advanced bioinspired heterogeneous materials for diverse structural and functional applications.

         <title>Assembly of Fillable Microrobotic Systems by Microfluidic Loading with Dip Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated technique to fabricate fillable microrobotic systems is developed based on microfluidic loading with dip sealing (MLDS). The fillable chamber design isolates the loaded cargo from its surroundings, maintains cargo stability, and facilitates high loading capacity. This technique expands opportunities in microrobotics for targeted on&#8208;demand cargo release and biosensing with an all&#8208;in&#8208;one fabrication method.








Abstract
Microrobots can provide spatiotemporally well&#8208;controlled cargo delivery that can improve therapeutic efficiency compared to conventional drug delivery strategies. Robust microfabrication methods to expand the variety of materials or cargoes that can be incorporated into microrobots can greatly broaden the scope of their functions. However, current surface coating or direct blending techniques used for cargo loading result in inefficient loading and poor cargo protection during transportation, which leads to cargo waste, degradation and non&#8208;specific release. Herein, a versatile platform to fabricate fillable microrobots using microfluidic loading and dip sealing (MLDS) is presented. MLDS enables the encapsulation of different types of cargoes within hollow microrobots and protection of cargo integrity. The technique is supported by high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with an integrated microfluidic loading system, which realizes a highly precise loading process and improves cargo loading capacity. A corresponding dip sealing strategy is developed to encase and protect the loaded cargo whilst maintaining the geometric and structural integrity of the loaded microrobots. This dip sealing technique is suitable for different materials, including thermal and light&#8208;responsive materials. The MLDS platform provides new opportunities for microrobotic systems in targeted drug delivery, environmental sensing, and chemically powered micromotor applications.

         <title>Composite Hydrogel for Spatiotemporal Lipid Intervention of Tumor Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;composite hydrogel delivers three&#8208;in&#8208;one lipid peroxidation (LPO)&#8208;inducing nanoparticles (NPs) to tumor cells for amplified immune stimuli, and carries lipid rewiring agent to immunosuppressive cells for enhanced immune perception, thereby spatiotemporally regulating the tumor milieu for improved therapeutic outcomes.








Abstract
Induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) plays crucial roles in cancer immunotherapy, whereas its efficacy is severely compromised by redundant antioxidant defenses in cancer cells and aberrant lipid metabolism in immunosuppressive cell populations. In&#160;this&#160;work, it is found that hollow mesoporous CuS nanoparticles (NPs) possess an intrinsic capacity of inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). When loaded with an inhibitor of the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), these NPs block two parallel redox systems and cooperate with near&#8208;infrared irradiation to reinforce ICD. A hydrogel co&#8208;delivering cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting CuS NPs and immunosuppressive&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting sulfo&#8208;N&#8208;succinimidyl oleate (SSO) for spatiotemporal lipid intervention i further fabricated. While the CuS NPs augment ICD via synergistic lipid peroxidation, SSO reinstates immune perception via lipid metabolic reprogramming, thereby coordinately triggering robust innate and adaptive immunity to restrain tumor growth, relapse, and metastasis. This study provides an immunometabolic therapy via orchestrated lipid modulation in the tumor milieu.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Homogeneous Chemical Distribution in Functional Polyradical Microspheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using analytical electron microscopy techniques, it is demonstrated that the postfunctionalization of solid polymeric microstructures can&#8212;unexpectedly&#8212;lead to polyradical functionalization throughout the entirety of the material.








Abstract
It is demonstrated that the postfunctionalization of solid polymeric microspheres can generate fully and throughout functionalized materials, contrary to the expectation that core&#8211;shell structures are generated. The full functionalization is illustrated on the example of photochemically generated microspheres, which are subsequently transformed into polyradical systems. Given the all&#8208;organic nature of the functionalized microspheres, characterization methods with high analytical sensitivity and spatial resolution are pioneered by directly visualizing the inner chemical distribution of the postfunctionalized microspheres based on characteristic electron energy loss signals in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specifically, ultrasonic ultramicrotomy is combined successfully with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and electron spectroscopic&#160;imaging (ESI) during TEM. These findings open a key avenue for analyzing all&#8208;organic low&#8208;contrast soft&#8208;matter material structures, while the specifically investigated system concomitantly holds promise as an all&#8208;radical solid&#8208;state functional material.

         <title>Density&#8208;of&#8208;States Matching&#8208;Induced Ultrahigh Current Density and High&#8208;Humidity Resistance in a Simply&#160;Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is developed by using conductive materials as the triboelectric layers and electrodes simultaneously. Because of the matched density of states, the TENG reaches an ultrahigh current density of 1333 mA&#160;m&#8722;2. More importantly, this device can work stably in high&#8208;humidity environments, which is always a big challenge for traditional TENGs.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can covert mechanical energy into electricity in a clean and sustainable manner. However, traditional TENGs are mainly limited by the low&#160;output current, and thus their practical applications are still limited. Herein, a new type of TENG is developed by using conductive materials as the triboelectric layers and electrodes simultaneously. Because of the matched density of states between the two triboelectric layers, this simply&#160;structured device reaches an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1400&#160;V and an ultrahigh current density of 1333&#160;mA m&#8722;2 when poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) film and copper (Cu) or aluminum (Al) foil are used as the triboelectric pair. The current density increases by nearly three orders of magnitude compared with traditional TENGs. More importantly, this device can work stably in high&#8208;humidity environments, which is always a big challenge for traditional TENGs. Surprisingly, this TENG can even perform well in the presence of water droplets. This work provides a new and effective strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance TENGs, which can be used in many practical applications in the near future.

         <title>Coupled Tamm phonon and plasmon polaritons for designer planar multi&#8208;resonance absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;selective absorbers (WS&#8208;absorbers) are of interest for various applications, including chemical sensing and light sources. Lithography&#8208;free fabrication of WS&#8208;absorbers can be realized via Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs) supported by distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) on plasmonic materials. While multi&#8208;frequency and nearly arbitrary spectra can be realized with TPPs via inverse design algorithms, demanding and thick DBRs are required for high quality&#8208;factors (Q&#8208;factors) and/or multi&#8208;band TPP&#8208;absorbers, increasing the cost and reducing fabrication error tolerance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate high Q&#8208;factor multi&#8208;band absorption with limited DBR layers (3 layers) by Tamm hybrid polaritons (THPs) formed by coupling TPPs and Tamm phonon polaritons (TPhPs) when modal frequencies are overlapped. Compared to the TPP component, the Q&#8208;factors of THPs are improved two&#8208;fold, and the angular broadening is also reduced two&#8208;fold, facilitating applications where narrow&#8208;band and non&#8208;dispersive WS&#8208;absorbers are needed. Moreover, we develop an open&#8208;source algorithm to inversely design THP&#8208;absorbers consisting of anisotropic media and exemplify that the modal frequencies can be assigned to desirable positions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inversely designed THP&#8208;absorbers can realize same spectral resonances with fewer DBR layers than a TPP&#8208;absorber, thus reducing the fabrication complexity and enabling more cost&#8208;effective, lithography&#8208;free, wafer&#8208;scale WS&#8208;EMs for applications such as free&#8208;space communications and gas sensing.

         <title>Extracting Polaron Recombination from Electroluminescence in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extraction of polaron dynamics from EL in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes is realized by AI. The quantitative understanding of polaron dynamics in complicated light&#8208;emitting processes is facilitated by predicting the recombination coefficient.








Abstract
Direct exploring the electroluminescence (EL) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is a challenge due to the complicated processes of polarons, excitons, and their interactions. This study demonstrated the extraction of the polaron dynamics from transient EL by predicting the recombination coefficient via artificial intelligence, overcoming multivariable kinetics problems. The performance of a machine learning (ML) model trained by various EL decay curves is significantly improved using a novel featurization method and input node optimization, achieving an R2 value of 0.947. The optimized ML model successfully predicts the recombination coefficients of actual OLEDs based on an exciplex&#8208;forming cohost, enabling the quantitative understanding of the overall polaron behavior under various electrical excitation conditions.

         <title>Plasmonic Dual&#8208;Gap Nanodumbbells for Label&#8208;Free On&#8208;Particle Raman DNA Assays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbell (AuDGN) structures are designed, synthesized, and analyzed wherein uniform and controllable dual gaps [inter&#8208;head (between dumbbell heads) and intra&#8208;head gaps (inside dumbbell heads)] with strong and tunable electromagnetic field exist. Target DNA can directly diffuse into these externally exposed nanogaps of AuDGNs for label&#8208;free molecular fingerprint surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing of varying DNA sequences.








Abstract
Metal nanostructures with a tunable plasmonic gap are useful for photonics, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, biosensing, and bioimaging applications. The use of these structures as chemical and biological sensing/imaging probes typically requires an ultra&#8208;precise synthesis of the targeted nanostructure in a high yield,&#160;with Raman dye&#8208;labeling and complex assay components and procedures. Here, a plasmonic nanostructure with tunable dual nanogaps, Au dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbells (AuDGNs), is designed and synthesized&#160;via the anisotropic adsorption of polyethyleneimine on Au nanorods to facilitate tip&#8208;selective Au growths on nanorod tips for forming mushroom&#8208;shaped dumbbell&#8208;head structures at both tips and results in dual gaps (intra&#8208;head and inter&#8208;head gaps) within a single particle. AuDGNs are synthesized in a high yield (&gt;90%) while controlling the inter&#8208;head gap size, and the average surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factor (EF) value is 7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;108 with a very narrow EF distribution from 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;108 to 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;109 for &gt;90% of analyzed particles. Importantly, AuDGNs enable label&#8208;free on&#8208;particle SERS detection assays through the diffusion of target molecules into the intraparticle gap for different DNA sequences with varying ATGC combinations in a highly specific and sensitive manner without a need for Raman dyes.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Triggered Transformable Polypeptide Self&#8208;Assembly to Initiate Tumor&#8208;Specific Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive transformable polypeptide nanoparticle is shown to initiate selective biomineralization for effective blockade therapy of osteosarcoma after activation by the acidic tumor microenvironment, which triggers continuous ion deposition to construct a mineralized barrier around the tumor and alleviates bone dissolution to suppress osteosarcoma progression, indicating significant potential for clinical osteosarcoma therapy.








Abstract
Biomineralization is a normal physiological process that includes nucleation, crystal growth, phase transformation, and orientation evolution. Notably, artificially induced biomineralization in the tumor tissue has emerged as an unconventional yet promising modality for malignancy therapy. However, the modest ion&#8208;chelating capabilities of carboxyl&#8208;containing biomineralization initiators lead to a deficient blockade, thus compromising antitumor efficacy. Herein, a biomineralization&#8208;inducing nanoparticle (BINP) is developed for blockade therapy of osteosarcoma. BINP is composed of dodecylamine&#8208;poly((&#947;&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate)&#8208;co&#8208;(l&#8208;histidine))&#8208;block&#8208;poly(l&#8208;glutamate&#8208;graft&#8208;alendronate) and combines a cytomembrane&#8208;insertion moiety, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive component, and an ion&#8208;chelating motif. After intravenous injection into osteosarcoma&#8208;bearing mice, BINP responds to the acidic TME to expose the dodecyl group on the surface of the expanded nanoparticles, facilitating their cytomembrane insertion. Subsequently, the protruding bisphosphonic acid group triggers continuous ion deposition to construct a mineralized barrier around the tumor, which blocks substance exchange between the tumor and surrounding normal tissues. The BINP&#8208;mediated blockade therapy displays tumor inhibition rates of 59.3% and 52.1% for subcutaneous and orthotopic osteosarcomas, respectively, compared with the Control group. In addition, the suppression of osteoclasts by the alendronate moiety alleviates bone dissolution and further inhibits pulmonary metastases. Hence, the BINP&#8208;initiated selective biomineralization provides a promising alternative for clinical osteosarcoma therapy.

         <title>Tailoring the d&#8208;Orbital Splitting Manner of Single Atomic Sites for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe d&#8208;orbital splitting manner modulation strategy is proposed to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 sites. The axial tractions induce the transformation of local crystal field from primary square&#8208;planar field to the quasi&#8208;octahedral coordination. The rearrangement of electronic states leads to a favorable adsorption of ORR intermediates and excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Regulating the electronic states of single atomic sites around the Fermi level remains a major concern for boosting the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a Fe d&#8208;orbital splitting manner modulation strategy by constructing axial coordination on Fe&#63743;N4 sites is presented. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the axial tractions induce the distortion of square&#8208;planar field (Fe&#63743;N4 SP), up to the quasi&#8208;octahedral coordination (Fe&#63743;N4O1 OCquasi), thus leading to the electron rearrangement with a diluted spin polarization. The declined population of unpaired electrons in dz2, dxz and dyz states engenders a moderate adsorption of ORR intermediates, thereby reinforcing the intrinsic reaction activity. In situ infrared spectroscopy further demonstrates that the reordering of d&#8208;orbital splitting and occupation facilitates the desorption of *OH. The Fe&#63743;N4O1 OCquasi exhibits a dramatic improvement of kinetic current density and turnover frequency, which are fivefold and tenfold higher than those of Fe&#63743;N4 SP. This work presents a novel understanding on improving the electrocatalytic performance through the orbital&#8208;scale manipulation.

         <title>Hygrothermic Wood Actuated Robotic Hand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stimulus&#8211;responsive actuators play a vital role in the new generation of intelligent systems. However, poor mechanical performance, complicated fabrication processes, and the inability for complex deformation limit their practical applications. Herein, we overcome these challenges via designing a strong hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity. The actuator is readily constructed by sandwiching a polypyrrole&#8211;coated wood with a Ni complex hygroscopic gel top layer for moisture absorption and a polyimide bottom layer as the water barrier. The resulting hygrothermic wood spontaneously stretches and bends itself in response to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. A robotic hand and a series of grippers made of the hygrothermic wood demonstrated dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions during grasping and holding, while the reversible hygrothermic property allows the actuator to be potentially applied in fire rescue scenarios to rescue trapped objects. A combination of good mechanical properties, multi&#8211;stimulus response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost and biocompatibility were simultaneously realized by one device. It is thus believed that such a strong wood actuator will open up a new avenue for building intelligent robotic hand systems.

         <title>An n&#8208;type All&#8208;Fused&#8208;Ring Molecule with Photoresponse to 1000&#160;nm for Highly Sensitive Near Infrared Photodetector</title>

Abstract
Most of all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules have wide or medium bandgap and show photo response in the visible range. In this work, we report an all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring n&#8208;type molecule, which exhibits ultrasmall optical bandgap of 1.22&#160;eV and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption with onset absorption wavelength of 1013&#160;nm. The molecule consists of 14 aromatic rings and has electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) characteristic. It exhibits excellent n&#8208;type property with low&#8208;lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels of &#8722;5.48&#160;eV/&#8722;3.95&#160;eV and high electron mobility of 7.0 &#215; 10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Most importantly, its thin film exhibits a low trap density of 5.55 &#215;1016 cm&#8722;3 because of the fixed molecular conformation and consequently low conformation disorder. As a result, organic photodetector (OPD) based on the compound exhibits a remarkably low dark current density (Jd) of 2.01 &#215; 10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V. The device shows a shot&#8208;noise&#8208;limited specific detectivity (Dsh*) of exceeding 1013 Jones at 400&#8722;1000&#160;nm wavelength region with a peak specific detectivity of 4.65 &#215; 1013 Jones at 880&#160;nm. This performance is among the best reported for self&#8208;powered NIR OPDs.

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Assisted In&#8208;Situ Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide perovskite quantum dots (FAxCs1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs) show high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving composition&#8208;tunable hybrid PQDs with desirable charge transport remains a significant challenge. Herein, by leveraging an antisolvent&#8208;assisted in&#8208;situ cation exchange of PQDs, homogeneous FAxCs1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs with controllable stoichiometries and surface ligand chemistry are realized. Meanwhile, the crystallographic stability of PQDs is substantially improved by substituting the cations of the PQDs mediated by surface vacancies. Consequently, PQD solar cell delivers an efficiency of 17.29%, the highest value among the homo&#8208;structured PQD solar cells. The high photovoltaic performance is attributed to the broadened light harvesting spectra, flattened energy landscape and rationalized energy levels of highly oriented PQD solids, leading to efficient charge carrier extraction. This work provides a feasible approach for the stoichiometry regulation of PQDs to finely tailor the optoelectronic properties and tolerance factors of PQDs toward high&#8208;performing photovoltaics.

The high photovoltaic performance is attributed to the broadened light harvesting spectra, flattened energy landscape and rationalized energy levels of highly oriented PQD solids, leading to efficient charge carrier extraction. This work provides a feasible approach for the stoichiometry regulation of PQDs to finely tailor the optoelectronic properties and tolerance factors of PQDs toward high-performing photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal&#8208;Redox Bicatalyst Batteries for Energy Storage and Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device is the metal&#8208;redox bicatalyst battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional catalyst (named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants while anode is metal, driven by cathodic electrocatalytic reactions during charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical production. In this system, the metal anode, redox&#8208;bicatalyst cathode, electrolytes and the redox electrochemical reactions can be modified and adjusted to achieve the optimal energy conversion and utilization. Therefore, the deep understanding of the electrochemical system is conducive to designing new devices to meet the demand among various applications, including energy storage and conversion. In this review, we clarify the fundamentals and design principles of the rechargeable/reversible metal&#8208;redox bicatalyst batteries and how each part affects the devices in energy conversion and chemical production. We summarize the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions, the reported systems relied on redox reactions and the corresponding redox bicatalysts. Finally, a perspective of the key challenges and the possible new types of metal&#8208;redox bicatalyst batteries for efficient energy utilization and chemical production are given.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Carbonization &#8211; A powerful tool for micro&#8208;fabrication of patterned electronic carbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fabricating electronic devices from natural, renewable resources has been a common goal in engineering and materials science for many years. In this regard, carbon is of special significance due to its biocompatibility combined with electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability. In microelectronics, however, carbon's device application is often inhibited by tedious and expensive preparation processes and lack of control over processing and material parameters. Laser&#8208;assisted carbonization is emerging as a tool for precise and selective synthesis of functional carbon&#8208;based materials for flexible device applications. In contrast to conventional carbonization via in&#8208;furnace pyrolysis, laser&#8208;carbonization is induced photo&#8208;thermally and occurs on the time&#8208;scale of milliseconds. By careful selection of the precursors and process parameters, the properties of this so&#8208;called laser&#8208;patterned carbon (LP&#8208;C) such as porosity, surface polarity, functional groups, degree of graphitization, charge&#8208;carrier structure etc. can be tuned. In this critical review, we generate a common perspective on laser&#8208;carbonization in the context of general carbonization strategies, fundamentals of laser&#8208;induced materials processing, and flexible electronic applications, like electrodes for sensors, electrocatalysts, energy storage, or antennas. An attempt is made to have equal emphasis on material processing and applications aspects such that this emerging technology can be optimally positioned in the broader context of carbon&#8208;based microfabrication.

         <title>Controlled Isotropic Canalization of Micro&#8208;Sized Silicon Enabling Stable High&#8208;Rate and High&#8208;Loading Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Silicon is attractive for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and beyond but suffers large volume change upon cycling. Hierarchical tactics show promise yet lack control over the unit construction and arrangement, limiting stability improvement at the practical level. Here, a protocol is developed as controlled isotropic canalization of micro&#8208;sized silicon. Distinct from the existing strategies, it involves isotropic canalization by honeycomb&#8208;like radial arrangement of silicon nanosheets, and canal consolidation by controlled dual bonding of silicon with carbon. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dual&#8208;bonded silicon honeycomb&#8208;like microparticles, specifically with a medium density of C&#8208;N&#8208;Si and C&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds, exhibit stable cycling impressively at high rates and industrial&#8208;scale loadings. Two key issues involve isotropic canalization facilitating ion transport in all directions of individual granules and controlled consolidation conferring selective ion permeation and securing charge transport. The study highlights the configurational isotropy and interfacial bonding density, provides insight into rational design and manufacture of silicon and others with industry&#8208;viable features.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Contained Alloy as a Robustly&#8208;Adhered Interfacial Lattice Locking Layer for Planar and Stable Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stable zinc (Zn)/electrolyte interface is critical for developing rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZBs) with long&#8208;term stability, which requires the dense and stable Zn electrodeposition. Herein, we construct an interfacial lattice locking (ILL) layer via the electro&#8208;co&#8208;deposition of Zn and Cu onto the Zn electrodes. The ILL layer shows a low lattice misfit (&#948; = 0.036) with Zn (002) plane and selectively locks the lattice orientation of Zn deposits, enabling the epitaxial growth of Zn deposits layer by layer. Benefiting from the unique orientation&#8208;guiding and robustly&#8208;adhered properties, the ILL layer enables the symmetric Zn||Zn cells to achieve an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of &gt; 6000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA/cm2 and 1 mAh/cm2, a low overpotential (65&#160;mV) at 10 mAh/cm2, and a stable Zn plating/stripping for &gt; 90&#160;h at an ultrahigh Zn discharge depth (DODZn = &#8764;85%). Even with a limited Zn supply and a high current density (8.58&#160;mA/cm2), the ILL@Zn||Ni&#8208;doped MnO2 cells could still survive for &gt; 2300 cycles.

         <title>Metal&#8208;halide Perovskite Lasers: Cavity Formation and Emission Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown remarkable optoelectronic properties as well as facile and cost&#8208;effective processability. With the success of MHP solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), MHPs have also exhibited great potential as gain media for on&#8208;chip lasers. However, to date, stable operation of optically pumped MHP lasers and electrically driven MHP lasers &#8212; an essential requirement for MHP laser's insertion into chip&#8208;scale photonic integrated circuits &#8212; have not yet been demonstrated. The main obstacles include the instability of MHPs in the atmosphere, rudimentary MHP laser cavity patterning methods, and insufficient understanding of emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of different strategies to improve the intrinsic properties of MHPs in the atmosphere and to establish an optimal MHP cavity patterning method. In addition, this review discusses different emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities and how to distinguish them.

         <title>Enhanced Spin Current in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx Bilayer with Top and Sideways Oxidization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sizeable spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations based on the spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion can be manipulated by changing the annealing temperature, time, and the Hall&#8208;bar channel width, providing a novel approach to developing efficient spintronic devices.








Abstract
Generation and manipulation of spin current are the cores of spintronic devices, which are intensely pursued. Heavy metals with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling are commonly used for the generation of spin current, but are&#160;incompatible with the mass production of devices, and the polarization of spin current is limited to be in&#8208;plane. Here, it is shown that the spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion efficiency can be enhanced through the spin currents consisting of both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;z) and in&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;y) induced by spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. Such a spin current is demonstrated to be closely related to the lateral oxidization gradient and can be controlled by changing the temperatures and times of annealing. The finding here provides a novel degree of freedom to produce and control the spin current in spintronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;A sizeable spin current with strong out-of-plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni&lt;sub&gt;81&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&#8211;CuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations based on the spin-vorticity coupling. The charge-to-spin current conversion can be manipulated by changing the annealing temperature, time, and the Hall-bar channel width, providing a novel approach to developing efficient spintronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation and manipulation of spin current are the cores of spintronic devices, which are intensely pursued. Heavy metals with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling are commonly used for the generation of spin current, but are&#160;incompatible with the mass production of devices, and the polarization of spin current is limited to be in-plane. Here, it is shown that the spin current with strong out-of-plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni&lt;sub&gt;81&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&#8211;CuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations. The charge-to-spin current conversion efficiency can be enhanced through the spin currents consisting of both out-of-plane polarization (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) and in-plane polarization (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) induced by spin-vorticity coupling. Such a spin current is demonstrated to be closely related to the lateral oxidization gradient and can be controlled by changing the temperatures and times of annealing. The finding here provides a novel degree of freedom to produce and control the spin current in spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Road to the Frontiers of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Review and Outlook of Graphene Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fascinating physicochemical properties endow graphene with great prospects in substituting the graphite&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This review aims to provide a research roadmap of graphene anodes by means of systematically summarizing and in&#8208;depth analyzing the related advances for high&#8208;performance LIBs. Finally, future challenges and research directions associated with the practical application of graphene anodes are outlined.








Abstract
Graphene has long been recognized as a potential anode for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The past decade has witnessed the rapid advancement of graphene anodes, and considerable breakthroughs are achieved so far. In this review, the aim is to provide a research roadmap of graphene anodes toward practical LIBs. The Li storage mechanism of graphene is started with&#160;and then the approaches to improve its electrochemical performance&#160;are comprehensively summarized. First, morphologically engineered graphene anodes with porous, spheric, ribboned, defective and holey structures display improved capacity and rate performance owing to their highly accessible surface area, interconnected diffusion channels, and sufficient active sites. Surface&#8208;modified graphene anodes with less aggregation, fast electrons/ions transportation, and optimal solid electrolyte interphase are discussed, demonstrating the close connection between the surface structure and electrochemical activity of graphene. Second, graphene derivatives anodes prepared by heteroatom doping and covalent functionalization are outlined, which show great advantages in boosting the Li storage performances because of the additionally introduced defect/active sites for further Li accommodation. Furthermore, binder&#8208;free and free&#8208;standing graphene electrodes are&#160;presented,&#160;exhibiting great prospects for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and flexible LIBs. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities of practically available graphene anodes for advanced LIBs are highlighted.

         <title>Active Textile Fabrics from Weaving Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crafting of active fabrics incorporating liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) yarn&#160;is&#160;reported. Two types of LCE yarns with different elasticities enable over 10% reversible actuation strain on repeated heating cycles and blocking force of &#8776;1&#8211;2&#160;N&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Active fabrics, responding autonomously to environmental changes, are the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of the development of smart textiles. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) promise to be the base materials for large&#8208;stroke reversible actuation. The mechanical behavior of LCEs matches almost exactly the human muscle. Yet, it has not been&#160;possible to produce filaments from LCEs that will be suitable for standard textile production methods, such as weaving. Based on the recent development of LCE fibers, here, the crafting of active fabrics incorporating LCE yarn, woven on a standard loom, giving control over the weave density and structure, is presented. Two types of LCE yarns (soft and stiff) and their incorporation into several weaving patterns are tested, and the &#8220;champions&#8221; identified: the twill pattern with stiffer LCE yarn that shows the greatest blocking force of 1&#8211;2&#160;N&#160;cm&#8722;1 , and the weft rib pattern with over 10% reversible actuation strain on repeated heating cycles. Reversible 3D shape changes of active fabric utilize the circular weaving patterns that lead to cone shapes upon heating. The seamless combination of active LCE yarns into the rich portfolio of existing passive yarns can be transformative in creating new stimuli&#8208;responsive actuating textiles.

         <title>High Durability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Carbon Vacancies toward the&#160;Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy&#8208;modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are successfully prepared through microenvironment modulation and applied as highly durable catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and zinc&#8211;air batteries. The vacancies around metal&#8211;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics and stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive interest to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, the development of SACs with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability is a great challenge. In this work, carbon vacancy modified Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs (FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C) are practically designed and synthesized through microenvironment modulation, achieving high&#8208;efficient utilization of active sites and optimization of electronic structures. The FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91&#160;V and sufficient durability of 100&#8201;000 voltage cycles with 29&#160;mV E1/2 loss. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the vacancies around metal&#8211;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the ORR kinetics and stability. Accordingly, FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs presented a high&#8208;power density and long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#160;h in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). This work will not only guide for developing highly active and stable SACs through rational modulation of metal&#8211;N4 sites, but also provide an insight into the optimization of the electronic structure to boost electrocatalytical performances.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation on Photocatalysts with Ferroelectric Single Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;prepared BiFeO3 nanosheets are confirmed as ferroelectric single domains, and their potential in photocatalysis is identified by comparison&#160;with polydomain particles. Selective deposition of cocatalysts further boosts the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain BiFeO3 nanosheets. The superiority of the&#160;single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts is emphasized, which offers a path to utilize the energetic photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials are considered as promising photocatalysts due to their efficient charge separation via a&#160;polarization&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field. However, the polydomain structures hinder spatial charge separation and transfer due to the cancellation of polarization vectors in the domains. In&#160;this&#160;work, taking BiFeO3 (BFO) as a prototype, single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets with visible&#8208;light absorption are prepared, as evident by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SRSPS), and photodeposition experiments. The single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets show nine times activity in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with that of the polydomain BFO particles. With the asymmetric driving force for charge separation in a single domain, selective deposition of cocatalysts further enhances the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain ferroelectric BFO nanosheets. These results demonstrate the role of the&#160;single&#8208;domain structure in constructing the driving force of charge separation in ferroelectric photocatalysts. The fabrication of single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity offers a path to efficiently utilize the photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Guided In Situ Genetic Engineering of Macrophages for Sustained Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

An X&#8208;ray&#8208;guided and triggered remote control of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome&#8208;editing strategy is reported, to specifically and permanently repolarize TAMs toward M1 phenotype without reconversion by blocking CSF1&#8208;R and SIRP&#945; expressions both in vitro and in vivo, thereby inducing the phagocytosis of tumor cells and eliciting robust antitumor immunity, while reducing systemic toxicities.








Abstract
Effective repolarization of macrophages has emerged as a promising approach for anticancer therapy. However, there are very few studies on the effect of reprogramming macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype without reconversion while maintaining an activated M1 phenotype. Moreover, these immunomodulatory methods have serious drawbacks due to the activation of normal monocytic cells. Therefore, it remains a challenge to selectively reprogram tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) without systemic toxicities. Here, X&#8208;ray&#8208;guided and triggered remote control of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (X&#8208;CC9) that exclusively activates therapeutic agents at tumor sites is established. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, X&#8208;CC9 selectively enhances M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 repolarization within the tumor microenvironment, and significantly improves antitumor efficacy with robust immune responses in two animal models. This strategy provides an ideal method for improving the safety of macrophage polarization and may constitute a promising immunotherapy strategy.

         <title>Controlled Adhesion of Ice&#8212;Toward Ultraclean 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ice&#8208;aided transfer, ice&#8208;stamp transfer, and ice cleaning methods, completely free from polymer and solvents, are developed to yield ultrahigh quality and exceptional cleanliness in 2D materials, which&#160;will&#160;contribute&#160;to technological revolutions in 2D materials, and their associated structures and devices.








Abstract
The scalable 2D&#160;device fabrication and integration demand either the large&#8208;area synthesis or the post&#8208;synthesis transfer of 2D layers. While the direct synthesis of 2D materials on most targeted surfaces remains challenging, the transfer approach from the growth substrate onto the targeted surfaces offers an alternative pathway for applications and integrations. However, the current transfer techniques for 2D materials predominantly involve polymers and organic solvents, which are liable to contaminate or deform the ultrasensitive atomic layers. Here, novel ice&#8208;aided transfer and ice&#8208;stamp transfer methods are developed, in which water (ice) is the only medium in the entire process. In practice, the adhesion between various 2D materials and ice can be well controlled by temperature. Through such controlled adhesion of ice, it is shown that the new transfer methods can yield ultrahigh quality and exceptional cleanliness in transferred 2D flakes and continuous 2D films, and are applicable for a wide range of substrates. Furthermore, beyond transfer, ice can also be used for cleaning the surfaces of 2D materials at higher temperatures. These novel techniques can enable unprecedented ultraclean 2D materials surfaces and performances, and will contribute to the upcoming technological revolutions associated with 2D materials.

         <title>Stabilizing Single&#8208;Atomic Pt by Forming Pt&#63743;Fe Bonds for Efficient Diboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Pt catalyst with Fe&#8211;Pt&#8211;O structure is constructed to tune the oxidation state of Pt for high catalytic efficiency of the diboration of alkynes. Benefiting from the well&#8208;tuned structure, the catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance at high temperature. Strikingly, the reaction can be catalyzed at room temperature with a relatively high turnover frequency.








Abstract
Precisely tailoring the oxidation state of single&#8208;atomic metal in heterogeneous catalysis is an efficient way to stabilize the single&#8208;atomic site and promote their activity, but realizing this approach remains a grand challenge to date. Herein, a class of stable single&#8208;atomic catalysts with well&#8208;tuned oxidation state of Pt by forming Pt&#63743;Fe atomic bonds&#160;is&#160;reported, which are supported by defective Fe2O3&#160;nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (PFARFNs). These as&#8208;synthesized materials can greatly enhance the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity for the diboration of alkynes. The PFARFNs exhibit high conversion of 99% at 100&#160;&#176;C with an outstanding turnover frequency (TOF) of 545&#160;h&#8722;1, and a relatively high conversion of 58% at room temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) with a TOF of 310&#160;h&#8722;1, which has been&#160;hardly achieved previously. Through both experimental and theoretical investigation, it is demonstrated that the fast electron transfer from Fe to Pt in Fe&#8211;Pt&#8211;O atomic sites in PFARFNs can not only stabilize the single&#8208;atomic Pt, but also significantly improve their catalytic activity.

         <title>Precisely Controllable Artificial Muscle with Continuous Morphing based on &#8220;Breathing&#8221; of Supramolecular Columns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid&#160;crystal polymer forms multichain supramolecular columnar assemblies. Through the cooperative movements of main&#8208;chains and side&#8208;chains, the uniaxially aligned polymer strip executes muscle&#8208;like continuous and reversible elongation/contraction. The irreversible photoisomerization of mesogens further endows the polymer strip with arm&#8208;like phototunable bending which can lift heavy load. Both deformations are under precise control of temperature.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles are natural motors executing sophisticated work through precise control of linear contraction. Although various liquid crystal polymers&#160;based artificial muscles have&#160;been designed, the mechanism based on mainly the order&#8211;disorder transition usually leads to discrete shape morphing, leaving arbitrary and precise deformation a huge challenge. Here, one novel photoresponsive hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid crystal polymer with a unique &#8220;breathing&#8221; columnar phase that enables continuous morphing is presented. Due to confinement inside the supramolecular columnar assembly, the cooperative movements of side&#8208;chains and backbones generate a significant negative thermal expansion and lead to temperature&#8208;controllable muscle&#8208;like elongation/contraction in the oriented polymer strip. The irreversible isomerization of the photoresponsive mesogens results in the synergistic phototunable bending and high&#8208;contrast fluorescence change. Based on the orthogonal responses to heat and light, controllable arm&#8208;like bending motions of this material, which is applicable in constructing advanced artificial muscles or intelligent soft robotics, are further demonstrated.

         <title>The Atomic Drill Bit: Precision Controlled Atomic Fabrication of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through direct and automated control over the electron beam scan pathway profile in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, metallic 1D&#8211;2D edge heterostructures are fabricated with atomic precision in semiconducting MoS2. This atomic fabrication workflow paves the way for precision controlled atomic fabrication of functional nanomaterials.








Abstract
The ability to deterministically fabricate nanoscale architectures with atomic precision is the central goal of nanotechnology, whereby highly localized changes in the atomic structure can be exploited to control device properties at their fundamental physical limit. Here, an automated, feedback&#8208;controlled atomic fabrication method is reported and the formation of 1D&#8211;2D heterostructures in MoS2 is demonstrated through selective transformations along specific crystallographic orientations. The atomic&#8208;scale probe of an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is used, and the shape and symmetry of the scan pathway relative to the sample orientation are controlled. The focused and shaped electron beam is used to reliably create Mo6S6 nanowire (MoS&#8208;NW) terminated metallic&#8208;semiconductor 1D&#8211;2D edge structures within a pristine MoS2 monolayer with atomic precision. From these results, it is found that a triangular beam path aligned along the zig&#8208;zag sulfur terminated (ZZS)&#160;direction forms stable MoS&#8208;NW edge structures with the highest degree of fidelity without resulting in disordering of the surrounding MoS2 monolayer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) are used to calculate the energetic barriers for the most stable atomic edge structures and atomic transformation pathways. These discoveries provide an automated method to improve understanding of atomic&#8208;scale transformations while opening a pathway toward more precise atomic&#8208;scale engineering of materials.

         <title>A Review on Regulating Li+ Solvation Structures in Carbonate Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of carbonate electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is highly influenced by the solvation structure of Li+. A comprehensive overview of strategies is presented for regulating the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes to improve Li+ behavior and the performance of LMBs. The remaining questions and perspectives for advanced carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are also outlined.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation battery systems due to their high energy density. However, commercialized carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anodes. While increasing cut&#8208;off voltage is an effective way to boost the energy density of LMBs, conventional ethylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes undergo a number of side reactions at high voltages. It is therefore critical to upgrade conventional carbonate electrolytes, the performance of which is highly influenced by the solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies to regulate the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes for LMBs by better understanding the science behind the Li+ solvation structure and Li+ behavior. Different strategies are systematically compared to help select better electrolytes for specific applications. The remaining scientific and technical problems are pointed out, and directions for future research on carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are proposed.

         <title>Breaking the Photostability and pH Limitation of Halo&#8208;Fluoresceins through Chitosan Conjugation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are famous for various applications, such as photoredox synthesis, photodynamic therapy, and sensing and imaging, but suffer from notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence, which limit their applications in long&#8208;term light exposure and acidic environments. Herein, a chitosan conjugation strategy is proposed for significantly increasing the anti&#8208;photobleaching activity and pH inertness of halo&#8208;fluoresceins, endowing these old dyes&#160;with&#160;new&#160;vitality.&#160;








Abstract
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are widely used in cell and tissue staining, intracellular sensing, and photodynamic therapy, but their notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence restrict their applications, especially in long&#8208;term visible light exposure and acidic environments. To overcome these limitations, here a strategy is proposed of conjugating chitosan with the carboxyl group of halo&#8208;fluorescein (CS&#8208;halofluorescein). The cross&#8208;linked polymer chains and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of chitosan help shielding out 1O2 from direct attacking the encapsulated halo&#8208;fluoresceins, leading to a&#160;two orders of magnitude lower photobleaching rate. Meanwhile, the condensation of primary amines of chitosan with the carboxyl group on halo&#8208;fluorescein blocks the pH&#8208;dependent intramolecular spirocyclization, leading to pH&#8208;inert fluorescein derivatives. The greatly improved photostability and pH inertness of CS&#8208;halofluoresceins can be harvested for aerobic photoredox synthesis and photodynamic bacteria inactivation in extremely acidic media. Moreover, food additive nature of chitosan and erythrosine (TIF) and excellent film&#8208;forming property of chitosan allow coating&#8208;based light&#8208;assisted preservation of perishable fruits, leading to appreciably extended shelf life of fruits (e.g., perishable strawberry, rt: &gt; 3 days; 4&#160;&#176;C: &gt; 5 days).
