         <title>Linking Electron Cloud Potential Wells to Achieve Ultrahigh Output Current in a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linking the electron cloud potential wells of triboelectric materials could lead to a huge increase in the output current of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). This hypothesis was verified by embedding conductive reduced graphene oxide into triboelectric layers of ethyl cellulose and polydimethylsiloxane, realizing a record&#8208;high current density of &#8764;3533 mA&#160;m&#8722;2. This TENG also showed excellent endurance in high&#8208;humidity and rainy environments. 








Abstract
With the development of the Internet of Things and intelligent robots, there is an increasing demand for distributed flexible sensor networks and portable power devices. As a self&#8208;powered sensor and micro/nano powering supplier, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that can convert the irregular and ubiquitous mechanical energy into electrical energy demonstrates promising applications in human&#8211;machine interaction, soft robotics, wearable healthcare, etc. However, achieving ultrahigh current density and water resistance in TENGs remains challenging, mainly due to the non&#8208;utilization of the electrons in the interior of triboelectric layers. Herein, it is proposed that linking the electron cloud potential wells (ECPWs) of triboelectric materials can lead to a huge increase in the output current of TENGs. This hypothesis is verified by embedding a conductive network of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into the triboelectric layers of ethyl cellulose (EC) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The TENG based on this model demonstrates a record&#8208;high current density of &#8776;3533&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 among the TENGs working in contact&#8208;separation mode. In addition, this TENG shows excellent endurance in high&#8208;humidity and even rainy environments. This work provides a novel and promising strategy for fabricating TENGs with ultrahigh output current and water resistance, largely expanding their practical applications in many fields.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Mechanoluminescent Haptic Sensor via Dual&#8208;Functional Chromatic Filtration by a Conjugated Polymer Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence (ML) platform is achieved through&#160;chromatic filtration strategy using a conjugated polymer shell (F8BT) on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide microparticles. This shell narrows the emission bandwidth, selectively filtering out blue noise, while simultaneously boosting intensity via ML photon recycling process. The dual action significantly enhances signal clarity and stability, enabling precise multi&#8208;signal differentiation in haptic sensors and advanced stress&#8208;sensing technologies.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence materials have emerged as promising candidates for haptic interface sensors due to their mechanically driven luminescent property. However, the inherently broad emission spectra of most mechanoluminescence materials hinder sharp signal generation and high spectral resolution. Here, a chromatic filtration strategy is suggested employing poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) as a conjugated polymer shell on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide to achieve a highly refined and intensified signal. By selectively suppressing spectral components below 490&#160;nm, the F8BT shell effectively narrows the emission bandwidth, yielding a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#160;nm during the mechanoluminescence process. In particular, F8BT shell efficiently mitigates signal intensity loss, which can be ascribed to the chromatic filtration ability, through mechanoluminescence photon recycling performance. This dual functionality significantly reduces spectral noise in the blue region with high intensity, enhancing the resolution in actual powerless haptic controllers. The novel approach establishes a scalable framework for high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence platforms, providing a versatile pathway toward next&#8208;generation, power&#8208;free stress&#8208;sensing applications with unprecedented spectral precision and optical fidelity.

         <title>Eliminating Mobility&#8208;Thickness Dependence in Transparent Conductive Oxide Layer Growth: A Critical Nucleation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical nucleation strategy is developed to eliminate mobility&#8208;thickness dependence in transparent conductive oxides. Via regulating reactive plasma deposition conditions, ultrathin cerium&#8208;doped indium oxide layers are fabricated with high mobility values. This strategy establishes a viable pathway for achieving high&#8208;quality ultrathin oxide semiconductor films in optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Carrier mobility is a key parameter for transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers. However, it shows significant thickness&#8208;dependent deterioration in the reports so far, making it challenging to obtain high&#8208;quality ultrathin TCO films. Here, a critical nucleation strategy (cns) is proposed, i.e., manipulating nucleation status that matches the intended film thickness, to break the spell. 30, 20, and 10 nm&#8208;thick cerium&#8208;doped indium oxide (ICO) films are successfully fabricated with electron mobility values of 127, 119, and 108 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, respectively, which exceed twice that of the films with equal thickness obtained from the conventional solid&#8208;phase crystallization approach. A novel film growth mode for fabricating a TCO layer with mobility independent of film thickness is proposed. It is claimed that an appropriate weakly&#8208;crystallized as&#8208;deposited film is a prerequisite for obtaining favorable crystallites with largely suppressed scattering from grain boundaries, ionized impurities, and film surface. Further, by implementing our 10 nm&#8208;thick ICO film into silicon heterojunction architecture, a device efficiency of 25.16% is demonstrated, which is comparable to the reference cell using a 102 nm&#8208;thick ICO film. This manifests a 90% indium reduction, indicating significant potential for future optoelectronic applications, particularly for the terawatt&#8208;scale photovoltaic industry expansion.

         <title>Metallic Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Cavity&#8208;Enhanced "Pseudo&#8208;Charge Transfer" Absorption for Efficient Narrowband Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance narrowband short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetector is fabricated through engineering a pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer state by doping an ultra&#8208;narrow&#8208;gap molecule coupled with an optimized Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonant cavity. This co&#8208;design approach yields spectrally selective photodetectors EQE exceeding 40% at zero&#8208;bias at 1020 nm, a FWHM of &lt;60 nm, a detectivity &gt; 3 &#215; 1013 Jones, and an over 140dB dynamic range, while maintaining excellent bending and environmental stability.








Abstract
Narrowband short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors, combining wavelength&#8208;specific detection with the inherent advantages of organic semiconductors, are important candidates for many applications like medical diagnostics, industrial sorting, and environmental monitoring. However, previously reported spectral&#8208;narrowing strategies often compromise device performance through structural complexity and intrinsic limitations of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) absorption, even when coupled with strong cavity device architectures. To address this, a pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer state is engineered by doping an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap third component, simultaneously optimizing electrode processing to minimize parasitic absorption and interface energetic barriers. This co&#8208;design approach yields spectrally selective photodetectors with an EQE exceeding 40% at zero&#8208;bias at 1020 nm, a FWHM of &lt; 60 nm, a detectivity &gt; 3 &#215; 1013 Jones, and an over 140dB dynamic range, while maintaining flexibility. PET&#8208;based devices show &lt;5% performance degradation after 3000 bending cycles. This work establishes a general design paradigm for organic narrowband photodetectors that combines laboratory&#8208;scale performance with practical manufacturability for wearable and large&#8208;area SWIR applications.

This study presents an orbital hybridization rhenium (Re)&#8208;palladium (Pd) nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic intelligent immune organelles for the treatment of bladder&#8208;metastasized tumors. Additionally, the organelle demonstrates a response to the tumor microenvironment by releasing RePd nanozyme and PD&#8208;L1 nb, which enhance tumor accumulation and facilitate synergistic catalytic&#8208;photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Immune&#8208;checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of bladder cancer. However, inadequate immune responses restrict their clinical application. To increase the efficacy of ICIs, a nanozyme&#8208;based intelligent biomimetic immune organelle has been developed for the treatment of metastatic bladder tumors. Initially, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanozyme platform is constructed using 1,2&#8208;Distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;Tk&#8208;(polyethylene glycol) (DSPE&#8208;TK&#8208;PEG)&#160;to assemble ultrasmall p&#8208;d orbital hybrid bimetallic rhenium (Re)&#8208;palladium (Pd) nanozyme. The orbital hybridization between the Re and Pd atoms significantly enhances the peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity of the Pd nanozyme. Additionally, the RePd nanozyme exhibits notable glutathione oxidase (GSH&#8208;OXD)&#8208;like activity, which reduces the clearance of ROS and enhances its capacity to induce oxidative stress. This platform is then coated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) engineered with PD&#8208;L1 nanobody (nb), which form RePd@OMVsPD&#8208;L1 nb. Upon entry into the tumor microenvironment, the RePd nanozyme is released, and the PD&#8208;L1 nb specifically binds to the tumor cell membrane to relieve its inhibition of T cells. Moreover, RePd@OMVsPD&#8208;L1 nb demonstrates enhanced tumor accumulation and promotes synergistic catalytic&#8210;photothermal therapy, inducing immunogenic cell death and promoting immune activation through the release of adjuvants. Consequently, the efficacy of PD&#8208;L1 nb is significantly improved, leading to the effective eradication of tumor cells and the inhibition of recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>A Universal Orientation&#8208;Engineering Strategy for Enhancing Mechano&#8208;Electric Conversion Performance in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Biopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;output triboelectric biopolymers through multiscale orientation engineering. The triboelectric output performance of silk fibroin is systematically analyzed for the first time from the perspective of interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport. The enhanced mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanism of orientation&#8208;optimized semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers is further explored based on molecular dynamic simulations and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials are the key to developing high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators. However, most semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers exhibit low triboelectric output performance due to the limitations in their intrinsic structure and physicochemical properties. Herein, orientation&#8208;regulated silk fibroin nanofibers (SFNs) with phase transition polarization and enhanced carrier migration are developed through high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;speed synergistic electrospinning technology. To analyze the molecular and aggregation structural changes of SFNs during high&#8208;voltage electric fields and stress&#8208;induced orientation processes, a multiscale structural evolutionary model is constructed from microscopic molecular chains to mesoscopic aggregation structures, and then to macroscopic fiber arrangements. It is found that as the orientation coefficient increases, the molecular conformation shifts from disordered &#945;&#8208;helices to ordered stacked &#946;&#8208;sheets. The aggregated molecular chains gradually slip, recombine, and arrange in an orderly manner along the direction of the stress field, which contributes to regulating the charge capture and carrier migration properties. The orientation&#8208;regulated SFNs significantly enhance the interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport capacity, thereby greatly improving the triboelectric performance. This work not only provides new insights into the mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanisms of semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers but also offers guidance for the design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials.

         <title>Photothermal Boost of Laser&#8208;Synthesized TiC Colloidal Variants with Engineered Solid&#8208;State Interfaces and Nitridation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiC Colloidal variants are synthesized via a green and waste&#8208;free laser fragmentation technique. The surface and elemental composition of the TiC colloids are tuned through laser&#8208;induced carbon nucleation and nitridation while maintaining their crystal integrity. These changes maximize light&#8211;colloid interactions, thereby improving photo thermalization. The underlying formation mechanisms of the TiC colloidal variants and their distinct photothermal responses are systematically investigated.








Abstract
Colloids are vital in many fields, including optics, energy conversion, and photothermal therapy. TiC colloids and their variants are synthesized in acetonitrile using a &#8220;green&#8221; femtosecond laser fragmentation method under varying laser&#8208;power conditions. Three distinct types of TiC colloids are produced: i) pure TiC spherical nanoparticles at low laser power (&lt;0.5&#160;W) through thermodynamically driven spheroidization; ii) TiC nanoparticles with a multilayer graphene shell at moderate laser power (0.5&#8211;1&#160;W) via carbon nucleation from acetonitrile decomposition; and iii) nitridated TiC nanoparticles with a multilayer graphene shell at high laser power (1.5&#8211;2&#160;W), achieved through nitrogen incorporation facilitated by the breakdown of strong C&#8801;N bonds in acetonitrile. The structural integrity of TiC in all three types of nanoparticles is maintained. The nanoparticle formation mechanisms are investigated, along with the effects of the interfaces and nitridation of TiC on its light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion. Photothermal measurements show a significant improvement in light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion for TiC nanoparticles with shells compared to pure TiC. This enhancement is attributed to light trapping within the colloidal solution, caused by the refractive index mismatch between TiC and graphene. Comparative scattering, absorption, and extinction efficiencies calculations based on Mie theory confirm this effect. Further photothermal enhancement is observed in the nitridated nanoparticles attributed to superior absorption in the NIR region. This study presents a sustainable approach for synthesizing photothermally efficient TiC&#8208;based colloids with nanoscale interface engineering and doping, enabling applications in energy and biomedical technologies.

Demonstration of strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and spin&#8208;locking of higher&#8208;order topological photonic states via momentum&#8208;biased orbital hybridization at corners of a Kagome triangular lattice.








Abstract
The advanced manipulation of topological photonic states with expanded degrees of freedom offers innovative ways of achieving robust light modulation and control. Here, by harnessing the orbital degree of freedom, strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and associated photonic spin&#8208;locking of Type&#8208;II higher&#8208;order topological states (HOTSs) are theoretically and experimentally demonstrated via momentum&#8208;biased orbital hybridization at the apex of a Kagome triangle lattice. The momentum bias, induced by the tilted incident light, not only produces symmetry breaking of the Kagome triangle lattice, but also introduces orbital momentum to Type&#8208;II HOTS. By attaining strong spin&#8208;locked SOC through momentum&#8208;biased topological orbital hybridization of Type&#8208;II HOTSs, the way is paved for the spin&#8208;based interplay and control between near&#8208;field and far&#8208;field in higher&#8208;order topological photonic crystals, with potential applications in polarization manipulation, spatial light modulation, quantum emitter control, and beyond.

         <title>Controllable Configuration of Constitutional Units in Vanadium/Iron&#8208;Based Polyanionic Compounds for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium/iron&#8208;based polyanionic compounds show significant potential as SIB cathodes. Herein, the effects of octahedral/tetrahedral constitutional unit characteristics on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between doping and Na&#8208;storage are systematically re&#8208;evaluated, with descriptors established for cross&#8208;material studies. Additionally, by proposing novel configuration compositions, controlling the arrangement of constitutional units, combined with interface/microstructure adjustments and theoretical simulations, to achieve multiscale optimization of polyanionic compounds.









Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are considered&#160;one&#160;of&#160;the&#160;most&#160;promising next&#8208;generation energy storage solutions. Among&#160;various electrode materials, vanadium/iron&#8208;based polyanionic compounds show significant potential as SIB cathodes due to their stable structures and high operating voltages, yet challenges persist in electron/Na+ transport and energy density. Although doping is an effective solution, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between dopant&#8208;induced configuration of octahedral/tetrahedral units and electrochemical performance remains poorly understood. Herein, the effects of composition and connection type of octahedral and tetrahedral constitutional units on Na&#8208;storage properties are systematically re&#8208;evaluated. By establishing descriptors and systematic analysis, the regulatory roles of octahedral/tetrahedral units are elucidated, establishing a fresh research perspective to describe the intrinsic impact of doping types on the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Additionally, other modification strategies are discussed to complement the research on the constitutional unit. In industrial applications, balancing electrochemical performance with air stability, cost, and large&#8208;scale production remains challenging, creating novel configuration compositions, controlling the structural arrangement of constitutional units, combined with interface and microstructural adjustments, are proposed to achieve multiscale modifications. Simultaneously, theoretical simulations will be employed to predict/validate their efficacy, providing insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost polyanionic compounds for sustainable SIBs.

Herein, the effects of composition and connection type of octahedral and tetrahedral constitutional units on Na-storage properties are systematically re-evaluated. By establishing descriptors and systematic analysis, the regulatory roles of octahedral/tetrahedral units are elucidated, establishing a fresh research perspective to describe the intrinsic impact of doping types on the structure-activity relationship. Additionally, other modification strategies are discussed to complement the research on the constitutional unit. In industrial applications, balancing electrochemical performance with air stability, cost, and large-scale production remains challenging, creating novel configuration compositions, controlling the structural arrangement of constitutional units, combined with interface and microstructural adjustments, are proposed to achieve multiscale modifications. Simultaneously, theoretical simulations will be employed to predict/validate their efficacy, providing insights for the rational design of high-performance and low-cost polyanionic compounds for sustainable SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermite Reaction&#8208;Induced Thermal Runaway of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor safety performances of high&#8208;energy lithium batteries are now threatening the lives and properties of human beings. Herein, it is found that cathode current collector aluminum (Al) foil can react with cathode active materials to form thermites. The thermite reaction releases energy accounting for &#8776;10 times of electric energy of the lithium&#8208;ion battery with 100% state of charge (SoC).








Abstract
Safety is a primary concern for the widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles as well as energy storage. Despite the numerous mechanisms proposed to explain thermal runaway (TR) and the various methods implemented to mitigate it, battery explosions still occur. This is predominantly due to an insufficient understanding of the TR mechanism. Herein, by combining various advanced analytical techniques with comprehensive analysis, it is found that aluminum (Al) foil, typically employed as the cathode current collector in LIBs, can react with some cathode active materials to form thermites. These thermite reactions generate substantial heat, contributing to explosions of LIBs, a mechanism that has been largely overlooked. Based on these findings, it is proposed that coating the Al foil with carbon can partially suppress these thermite reactions and substantially enhance the thermal stability of LIBs. This study offers new insights into the TR of LIBs and provides important guidance for developing safer batteries.

         <title>Synthesis Engineering of 2D Co3Sn2S2 with Tunable Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin non&#8208;layered 2D Co3Sn2S2 single crystal, which owns strong ferromagnetic order and giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE), are obtained through flux transformation mechanism. Combining dimensionality advantages and controllable Fe doping, a giant anomalous Hall angle of 48% and an anomalous Hall conductivity of 2200&#8201;&#937;&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are achieved, almost the highest ever recorded than in most known magnetic materials.








Abstract
2D kagome ferromagnetic materials serve as an exceptionally important platform for exploring spintronics and correlated quantum phenomena. However, the controllable synthesis of non&#8208;layered kagome ferromagnetic materials remains a significant challenge due to the absence of van der Waals gap. Here, it is shown that ultrathin non&#8208;layered 2D Co3Sn2S2 single crystal with kagome lattice, which owns strong ferromagnetic order and giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE), is obtained through flux transformation mechanism, where ultrathin Co3Sn2S2 single crystal is transformed from ultrathin layered intermediates of SnS2 or SnS. Magnetotransport measurements indicate that the AHE of the ultrathin Co3Sn2S2 single crystal is superior to those of its bulk and ultrathin polycrystalline counterparts. Further, combining dimensionality advantages and the introduced extrinsic contribution of Fe, where the doping concentration can be well controlled in 2D Co3Sn2S2, a giant anomalous Hall angle of 48% and an anomalous Hall conductivity of 2200&#8201;&#937;&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are achieved. Under zero magnetic field, these two values are, to the best of knowledge, almost the highest ever recorded than in most known magnetic materials. The results establish 2D non&#8208;layered ferromagnetic kagome lattice as a platform for exploration of quantum confinement effect and other correlated phenomena.

         <title>Automated Label&#8208;Free Assay for Viral Detection and Inhibitor Screening via Biomembrane&#8208;Functionalized Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectronic sensor integrating 2D cell membranes with organic microelectrode arrays enables detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 fusion pathways. Natively&#8208;expressed viral receptors promote monitoring of viral entry and screening of antibody&#8208;based inhibitors. Integration with microfluidics further enhances throughput and usability, establishing a powerful platform for investigating viral fusogenicity and accelerating antiviral drug development.








Abstract
Most virus infection assays have indirect readout such as virus number following entry (e.g., PCR, cell lysis). While effective, these technologies are labor&#8208;intensive, require specialized environments (e.g., sterile or RNA&#8208;free), and detect later&#8208;stage viral events like lysis or cell death, lacking sensitivity to early fusion events. To address these limitations, we present biologically relevant 2D membrane materials, host&#8208;cell&#8208;derived supported lipid bilayers (hcd&#8208;SLBs), integrated with organic microelectrode arrays (OMEAs) for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2)&#160;fusion. By overexpressing angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the native membranes, the platform functions as a viral sensor capable of detecting virus pseudo particles (VPPs) through the late pathway. Additionally, hcd&#8208;SLBs extracted from human lung epithelium expressing native ACE2 detect fusion events through the early pathway. The platform's utility as a drug&#8208;screening tool is demonstrated by testing antibodies targeting either the ACE2 on the host membrane or the viral spike (S) proteins. To enhance the throughput, microfluidics are integrated for automation and OMEAs are incorporated within each channel, miniaturizing the testing units. This system supports high&#8208;throughput data generation, automation, and scalability, providing an efficient platform for viral fusion detection that advances the study of pathogen&#8208;host interactions and accelerates antiviral drug discovery.

         <title>2D Cuprous Halide Scintillator with Dual Excitation&#8208;Dependent and Thermochromic Luminescence toward Multifunctional Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D lead&#8208;free cuprous halide, (AMP)2Cu2Br4 (AMP = N&#8208;aminomorpholine), exhibits excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent multicolor luminescence from blue, white to orange emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. The color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting and excellent scintillation performance support the promising applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode, laser technology, flexible temperature sensor, X&#8208;ray detection, medical diagnosis, and nondestructive inspection, etc.








Abstract
Excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent multicolor luminescent materials are valuable in advanced optoelectronic devices while they haven't been realized in 2D metal halides owing to the restrictions of Kasha's rule. Herein, we reported a novel 2D lead&#8208;free halide of (AMP)2Cu2Br4 (AMP = N&#8208;aminomorpholine) through structural engineering, in which the [Cu2Br4]2&#8722; layer is composed of corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;shared [CuBr4] tetrahedron. The non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure enables (AMP)2Cu2Br4 to exhibit an impressive second&#8208;harmonic generation signal of &#8776;0.8 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). Remarkably, (AMP)2Cu2Br4 possesses two independent self&#8208;trapped exciton&#8208;emitting states under different excitation energies, which display multicolor luminescence outputs from blue, white, to orange with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Additionally, the luminescence can be regulated in a wide temperature range of 300&#8211;400 K due to reversible energy transfer between two emitting bands, acting as a luminescence ratio thermometer with a ultrahigh relative thermal sensitivity of 56.755% K&#8722;1. High PLQY and large Stokes shift further endow (AMP)2Cu2Br4 strong radioluminescence with an ultrahigh light yield of 92,400 photons&#183;MeV&#8722;1, low detection limit of 121 nGyair&#183;s&#8722;1 and a short afterglow of 0.41&#160;ms. The abundant photophysical properties highlight the multiple optoelectronic applications of 2D cuprous halide in white light&#8208;emitting, laser technology, flexible temperature sensors, and X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Scalable Production of Highly&#8208;Reliable Graphene&#8208;Based Microchips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study compares GFETs with Al2O3 and hBN gate dielectrics on microchips, evaluating their stability and reliability. It highlights the superior performance of GFETs with hBN dielectric in maintaining ultra&#8208;low hysteresis (&#12296;20 mV) and minimal shifts in ID&#8208;VG characteristics over 2000 cycles, particularly at the charge neutrality point, in contrast to those with Al2O3 dielectric.








Abstract
Graphene is a gapless 2D material that could be used to fabricate superior electronic devices and circuits, particularly useful in the fields of telecommunication and sensing. While promising performance has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale, graphene integrated circuits at the wafer level suffer from poor reliability due to native defects, especially at interfaces with dielectrics and electrodes. Here, we show the fabrication of highly reliable graphene&#8208;based microchips, containing transistors and frequency doublers, on 200&#160;mm wafers through a multi&#8208;project wafer tape&#8208;out. Our transistors use multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as gate dielectric, and they exhibit record performance in terms of reliability. In particular, our hBN/graphene transistors show ultra&#8208;low hysteresis below 20 mV and negligible shifts of the on&#8208;state current and the charge neutrality point even after 2100 cycles. The ultra&#8208;stable response of our hBN/graphene transistors contrasts with that of devices using metal&#8208;oxide gate dielectrics (HfO2, Al2O3), which exhibit severe degradation after a few dozens of cycles. These results, consistent across multiple devices, show low variability and demonstrate a scalable process for mass production of graphene&#8208;based microchips.

         <title>Pyrazinoquinazoline&#8208;Based Eu&#8208;MOF Ratiometric Fluorescence Sensing: Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Meat Spoilage Enabled by Dynamic Regulation of LMCT/LLCT Triggered by Biogenic Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric platform using pyrazinoquinoxaline ligands, achieving biogenic amine detection via LMCT/LLCT&#8208;regulated fluorescence color shifts, integrated with hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated smartphone RGB analysis for real&#8208;time shrimp/chicken spoilage monitoring.








Abstract
This study develops a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric fluorescence sensor for biogenic amine detection in food spoilage monitoring. The sensor exhibits dual emission at 495 nm (ligand &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transition) and 615 nm (ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, LMCT) through the antenna effect. Biogenic amines specifically regulate the intensity ratio (I495nm/I615nm) by adsorbing into MOF pores via hydrogen bonding, triggering a dynamic equilibrium switch between LMCT and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (LLCT), causing fluorescence color shift from orange to green. Theoretical calculations reveal this response mechanism for the first time. Encapsulating Eu&#8208;MOF in agarose hydrogel&#8208;based portable tags with smartphone RGB analysis enables rapid quantitative detection of biogenic amines (detection limit: 3.7&#8211;9.1 &#181;M, response time &lt;10 min). The sensor allows real&#8208;time tracking of spoilage in shrimp and chicken stored at 0&#8211;25 &#176;C, with visual fluorescence color transitions reflecting amine accumulation levels. This work provides molecular insights into dynamic charge transfer regulation and establishes a high&#8208;sensitivity, visual, wearable solution for on&#8208;site food safety detection, advancing smart sensing technology in the food industry.

         <title>Precise Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters: Ligand Programming for Functionality Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand programming offers a precise strategy to tune metal nanocluster surfaces at the atomic level. By controlling metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry, this approach enables customizable structures with enhanced catalytic, optical, and biomedical functions. This work highlights how precise surface engineering transforms metal nanoclusters into smart platforms for next&#8208;generation materials.








Abstract
Precise surface engineering of metal nanoclusters (MNCs) has emerged as a powerful strategy for tailoring their structural, electronic, and catalytic properties. On the basis of traditional surface chemistry, ligand programming enables atomic&#8208;level control over MNC functionality by modulating metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry. These three layers within the &#8220;Engineering Zone&#8221; define structural flexibility, charge transfer pathways, molecular rigidity, and surface accessibility, key factors in optimizing catalytic activity, luminescence efficiency, and molecular recognition. This Perspective explores the chemistry governing ligand&#8208;directed MNC behavior in the three layers, highlighting its role in catalysis, photonics, and biomedicine. By integrating coordination chemistry, intra/inter&#8208;ligand design, and interfacial interactions, how ligand programming transforms MNCs is demonstrated into tunable platforms for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Insights from MNCs also provide a model for advancing surface engineering in broader nanomaterials, paving the way for innovative applications in materials science.

         <title>A Roadmap for Plasma&#8208;Enabled Electrocatalysis in Urea Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular plasma&#8212;electrochemical platform enables fully electrified urea synthesis from air and CO2 under ambient conditions. This Review integrates plasma oxidation, C&#9472;N coupling electrolysis, mechanistic insights, and techno&#8208;economic metrics into a roadmap for scalable, distributed, and renewable fertilizer production.








Abstract
Conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch/Bosch&#8211;Meiser routes link global urea production to fossil fuel&#8208;based ammonia, accounting for &#8776;2% of the world's energy use and &#8776;1.5% of CO2 emissions. A modular, fully electrified alternative is charted that cleaves the problem at its natural fault line: a non&#8208;thermal plasma first upgrades air to nitrate, then a CO2/NO3&#8722; co&#8208;electrolyzer stitches the two C&#9472;N bonds of urea at ambient conditions. The lens is deliberately cross&#8208;disciplinary: every bottleneck is probed with the question, &#8220;Has a cognate field already cracked this?&#8221; If so, how can the solution be mirrored here? Plasma physics contributes to vibrational pumping, power modulated reactors, and in water quenching; CO2 and nitrate electro&#8208;reduction supply relay&#8208;site catalyst design, vacancy tuning, and pulsed&#8208;bias choreography; flow&#8208;battery engineering guides carbonate&#8208;resilient gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs) and zero&#8208;gap membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies (MEAs); and analytical chemistry adds two&#8208;probe assays that unmask false&#8208;positive amine/amide signals. Stitching these advances together, techno&#8208;economic modeling shows that sub&#8208;megajoule plasmas, &#8805;70% urea&#8208;selective in the electrolyzer, and renewable electricity (RE) at &#8804;3.5&#162; kWh&#8722;1 can push green urea below the fossil&#8208;based benchmark.

&lt;p&gt;Conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch/Bosch&#8211;Meiser routes link global urea production to fossil fuel-based ammonia, accounting for &#8776;2% of the world's energy use and &#8776;1.5% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. A modular, fully electrified alternative is charted that cleaves the problem at its natural fault line: a non-thermal plasma first upgrades air to nitrate, then a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; co-electrolyzer stitches the two C&#9472;N bonds of urea at ambient conditions. The lens is deliberately cross-disciplinary: every bottleneck is probed with the question, &#8220;Has a cognate field already cracked this?&#8221; If so, how can the solution be mirrored here? Plasma physics contributes to vibrational pumping, power modulated reactors, and in water quenching; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrate electro-reduction supply relay-site catalyst design, vacancy tuning, and pulsed-bias choreography; flow-battery engineering guides carbonate-resilient gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) and zero-gap membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs); and analytical chemistry adds two-probe assays that unmask false-positive amine/amide signals. Stitching these advances together, techno-economic modeling shows that sub-megajoule plasmas, &#8805;70% urea-selective in the electrolyzer, and renewable electricity (RE) at &#8804;3.5&#162; kWh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can push green urea below the fossil-based benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Surface Autogenous Mineralization Enabling Epitaxial Zn Electrodeposition on Weakly Conductive Crystalline Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supercritical CO2&#8208;induced surface mineralization strategy is developed to form a dense ZnCO3 layer on Zinc (Zn) anodes. This crystalline coating enables epitaxial Zn growth along the (0002) plane, suppressing dendrites and enhancing metal anode lifespan to over 3500&#160;h. The method is simple, scalable, and effective, offering a promising route for durable Zn metal anodes in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Regulating Zinc (Zn) nucleation and crystal growth on the anode surface is critical for reliable aqueous Zn metal batteries. However, achieving scalable and uniform surface modifications remains challenging. A Supercritical CO2&#8208;induced surface autogenous mineralization (SAM) strategy is introduced to fabricate a large&#8208;area, uniform, and crystalline Smithsonite autogenous regulating layer (ARL) on Zn foil. SAM enables in situ generation of H2CO3 and direct reactions with Zn under supercritical conditions, suppressing Zn2+ hydrolysis and inducing in situ mineralization. The ARL well&#8208;defined facets provide zincophilic sites, promoting single&#8208;crystal Zn nucleation and facilitating dense epitaxial deposition, thereby mitigating dendrites and enhancing cycling stability. The modified electrodes achieve over 1200&#160;h with 99.48% Coulombic efficiency in SZn&#8208;4||Cu cells, over 3500&#160;h in symmetrical cells, and over 8000 cycles in full cells at high current densities. This scalable SAM route offers a robust platform for high&#8208;performance, long&#8208;life Zn anodes in next&#8208;generation aqueous energy storage.

         <title>Multimaterial 3D Printing in Activating Bath Enables In Situ Polymerization of Thermosets with Intricate Geometries and Diverse Elastic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new embedded 3D printing (EMB3D) strategy enables in situ polymerization of DCPD/COD&#8208;based inks within a fugitive reactive matrix where the activator in the matrix cures the printed filament. Cured ink properties are tunable through DCPD&#8208;COD comonomer ratios, yielding materials from stiff thermosets to soft elastomers. This approach allows fabrication of complex 3D structures containing high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio features as small as 5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Polydicyclopentadiene, p(DCPD), is a high&#8208;performance thermoset valued for its exceptional toughness, strength, and stiffness. When copolymerized with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (COD), its mechanical properties can be tuned from glassy to rubbery at room temperature. While frontal polymerization enables a rapid and energy&#8208;efficient route to 3D print DCPD&#8208;based materials, challenges such as ink shelf life and gravitational distortion, especially in direct ink writing of soft COD&#8208;rich formulations, must be considered. Here, a complementary chemical strategy is presented, embedded 3D printing, that enables localized in situ polymerization of printed DCPD/COD inks within a reactive support matrix. The matrix provides both physical support and a reservoir of chemical activator, which diffuses into the ink, activates a latent bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) Ru precatalyst, and initiates ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. Curing begins at the ink&#8211;matrix interface and propagates inward via diffusion, stabilizing the interface and preventing capillary&#8208;driven deformation regardless of the matrix yield stress. This approach eliminates the need for cold storage, external curing, or photoinitiation, significantly expanding the processing window. Using this method, diverse thermosetting and elastomeric architectures are fabricated with features as small as 5 &#181;m and aspect ratios of 100, including interlinked chains, shallow spherical shells exhibiting snap&#8208;through buckling, and hair&#8208;like fin arrays inaccessible through traditional techniques.

         <title>Van der Waals Integration of 1D Nb2Pd3Se8 and 2D WSe2 for Gate&#8208;Tunable In&#8208;Sensor Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed&#160;self&#8208;powered photodetectors for in&#8208;sensor image processing by integrating high&#8208;quality 1D Nb2Pd3Se8 with 2D WSe2. The type&#8208;I junction and a 1D van der Waals interfaceenable gate&#8208;tunable switching between n&#8208;p and n&#8208;n+ configurations, yieldingbroadband bi&#8208;directional photoresponse. The devices achieve high responsivity, fast response, and efficient high&#8208;energy photon collection.








Abstract
1D and 2D integrations provide significant promise for machine vision by enabling compact, power&#8208;efficient&#160;optoelectronic devices. However, the potential of 1D materials in mixed&#8208;dimensional structures for convolutional image processing remains largely unexplored. Here, high&#8208;quality 1D&#8208;Nb2Pd3Se8 is synthesized and integrated with&#160;2D&#8208;WSe2 to form self&#8208;powered photodetectors, exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable bi&#8208;directional photoresponse for image processing. Utilizing the narrow band gap and favorable work function of 1D&#8208;Nb2Pd3Se8, a type&#8208;I junction and 1D van der Waals interface are established with transition metal dichalcogenides. The gate tunable built&#8208;in electric field enables switching&#160;between n&#8208;p and n&#8208;n+ configurations, allowing the drift photocurrent direction to be reversed, achieving both negative and positive photocurrent. Furthermore, efficient conversion of high&#8208;energy photons along one dimension enhances sensitivity at 375&#160;nm. The device achieves a responsivity of 232&#160;mA W&#8722;1, external quantum efficiency of 77% at 375 nm illumination, rapid response time of ~3 &#181;s, detectivity of 6.35 &#215; 1010 Jones, and broadband photodetection from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared. The demonstrated gate&#8208;controllable, bi&#8208;directional photoresponse with linear power dependence in a 1D heterojunction offers a promising platform for&#160;in&#8208;sensor convolutional processing with high integration and portability.

         <title>3D Photonic Metacrystals with Enhanced Collective Mie Resonances for Dual Structural Coloration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents high&#8208;quality 3D CdS metacrystals with long&#8208;range order that suppress radiation losses, yielding 13&#8208;fold enhanced magnetic Mie resonances (Q = 17) and dual nonfading structural coloration. &#160; Wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues F.








Abstract
3D photonic crystals offer nonfading structural coloration and complex optical properties through coupled Mie resonances in high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials. Although strong magnetic resonances make them promising, they often suffer from optical losses in the visible spectrum. Enhancing Mie resonances and quality factors through collective coupling in lithographically ordered arrays has been demonstrated. However, large&#8208;area applications using self&#8208;assembled colloidal resonators in metafluid inks have been limited by&#160;inadequate monodispersity and insufficient surface charge, hindering effective ordering. Here, we report high&#8208;quality 3D Mie&#8208;resonant metacrystals formed by high&#8208;temperature self&#8208;assembly of CdS nanoparticles (refractive index 2.5). Their long&#8208;range ordering attenuates local density of states overlapping with Mie resonances, minimizing external radiation losses and yielding&#160;one order of magnitude enhancement in collective Mie behavior. A 13&#8208;fold enhancement in magnetic Mie resonances with quality factors reaching 17 is experimentally demonstrated. The structures produce Bragg peaks that coexist with enhanced collective Mie resonances, enabling angle&#8208;dependent, dual nonfading structural coloration across the visible and near&#8208;infrared spectrum. As a proof of concept, wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues. This work opens new avenues in durable structural coloration and multifunctional optical platforms for applications such as ultrasensitive polarimetry and advanced optical sensing.

         <title>Oral Covalent Organic Frameworks as Dysbiosis&#8208;Mitigating Oxalate Sequestrants for Crystalline Nephropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally screened and engineered, nonabsorbable covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable a gut&#8208;restricted therapeutic strategy for hyperoxaluria&#8208;driven crystalline nephropathy. By promoting intestinal oxalate sequestration and microbiota restoration, the orally administered COFs reduce urinary oxalate excretion and suppress renal crystal deposition and inflammation via modulation of the gut&#8211;kidney axis, highlighting a translationally relevant utilization of COF&#8208;like materials for metabolite&#8208;driven pathologies.








Abstract
Hyperoxaluria&#8208;related crystalline nephropathy progresses through a dynamic interplay among oxalate crystallization, renal inflammatory cascades, and gut dysbiosis. However, concurrent interventions for these interconnected pathways remain elusive. Here, we leverage the gut&#8208;kidney axis to address this multifaceted renal issue by employing cationic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as dysbiosis&#8208;mitigating oxalate sequestrants. Oxalate adsorption assays and density functional theory calculations identify the HCl&#8208;activated pyridine&#8208;functionalized COF1&#8208;Cl with superior oxalate adsorption capacity (94.5 mg&#160;g&#8722;1) and selectivity. Oral administration of COF1&#8208;Cl in a rat model of hyperoxaluria effectively sequestrates oxalate within the gut and facilitates the transcellular secretion of serum oxalate into the intestinal lumen by upregulating the oxalate transporter (SLC26A6), resulting in decreased urinary oxalate excretion. Oxalate sequestration by COF1&#8208;Cl restores the gut microbiota diversity and promotes the rebalance of typical bacteria associated with oxalate metabolism, stone formation risk, and immune homeostasis. This local gut effect inhibits renal oxalate crystal deposition and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in amelioration of renal function as evidenced by improved glomerular filtration and decreased blood creatinine and urea nitrogen levels. COF1&#8208;Cl also demonstrates good biosafety due to its inert and nonabsorbable nature. This work highlights the potential of utilizing a gut&#8208;restricted porous crystalline framework to address metabolism&#8208;driven pathology via gut&#8208;organ crosstalk.

         <title>Bright Chromium&#8208;Sensitized Lanthanide NIR&#8208;II Mechanoluminescence in a Piezoelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applications of mechanoluminescent materials are constrained by their limited emission in the NIR and suboptimal luminescence intensity. Herein, a bright NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescent material is developed by co&#8208;doping Cr3+/Ln3+ in piezoelectric &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3. The nearly complete energy transfer from concentrated Cr3+ to Yb3+ (or Er3+) results in 5.9&#8208; and 3.0&#8208;fold stronger mechanoluminescence compared to the well&#8208;established CaZnOS:Yb3+ and CaZnOS:Er3+, respectively.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials are critical components of high&#8208;performance optical devices for frontier applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, non&#8208;destructive analysis, and deep&#8208;tissue imaging. In this work, a bright Cr3+&#8208;sensitized lanthanide NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescence (ML) is developed in piezoelectric &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3. Specifically, a nearly complete energy transfer (ET) from highly doped Cr3+ ions to Yb3+ and Er3+ acceptors is observed, resulting in pronounced ML at 1002 and 1542&#160;nm. The NIR&#8208;II luminescence intensity is further improved by cation alloying due to the promotion of octahedral distortion, culminating in 5.9&#8208; and 3.0&#8208;fold stronger ML emissions compared to the well&#8208;established CaZnOS:Yb3+ and CaZnOS:Er3+, respectively. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations revealed that the ML behavior with high dopant concentration is enabled by strain&#8208;induced piezoelectric potential without the involvement of trapping states, thus exhibiting exceptional cycling stability. Finally, an innovative multi&#8208;level encryption framework is established for information protection with wavelength&#8208;selective readout capabilities by optical or mechanical excitation.

         <title>Dynamic Localization Effect of Dendritic and Eutectic Growth Patterns Stimulated by Space Fluid Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the containerless experiment conducted in space, a spatially ordered separation of dendritic and eutectic regions is observed on the surface of Nb&#8208;Si alloy. Furthermore, the space fluid flow induces a dynamic localization effect in the growth patterns of these dendrites and eutectics. These findings provide new insights into in&#8208;situ manufacturing and controlled growth of crystals in space environments.








Abstract
Conventional solidification theory asserts that eutectic phases solidify into only one specific morphology at a fixed undercooling when volume effects are negligible, while dendrites adopt rotationally parabolic tips. Here, experiments aboard China Space Station reveal that space fluid flow localization reshapes these dynamics: confined solute&#8208;thermal coupling near solid&#8208;liquid interfaces drives transitions among three eutectic growth patterns (worm&#8208;like, lamellar, faceted). Simultaneously, Marangoni convection at large undercoolings induces non&#8208;parabolic dendritic tip morphologies (dome&#8208;like, finger&#8208;like, needle&#8208;like). Spatially ordered separation of eutectic and dendritic zones is governed by localized spherically symmetric temperature and concentration fields arising from space fluid flow, whereas buoyancy&#8208;driven convection in terrestrial gravity environment disrupts this ordering, perturbing phase domain distributions. When solidified at a small undercooling, the weak convection during late stage preserves the near&#8208;perfect symmetry of dendrites under microgravity. These findings uncover novel dendritic and eutectic growth patterns under microgravity and may be applied to in&#8208;situ space manufacturing and controlled growth of crystals.

         <title>Cage Effect of Nitrogen Oxide Radicals Enables Li&#8208;NOx Cell with a 3.8&#160;V Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Li&#8208;NOx battery chemistry achieves reversible 3.8 V operation by harnessing the cage effect of nitrogen oxide (NO) radicals. This strategy establishes a viable NOx redox mechanism for high&#8208;voltage energy storage and presents a sustainable route for NOx valorization.








Abstract
The utilization of redox&#8208;active gas as cathode materials has been proposed as a promising approach to meet the demand for next&#8208;generation battery technologies. Toward this end, nitrogen oxides (NOx)&#8212;inexpensive, abundant gases readily produced from ammonia on an industrial scale&#8212;is a promising energy storage media; however, its utilization as cathode material has not been achieved. In this work, the cage effect of NO and NO2 radicals are utilized to stabilize the charge product of Li&#8208;NOx cell as N2O3. This cell operates via reversible redox of LiNO3 to N2O3, achieving a specific capacity of 1,570&#160;mA h gcarbon&#8722;1 or 25&#8201;mA h&#8201;cmelectrode&#8722;2&#160;at a full cell voltage of 3.85&#160;V with an average energy efficiency of 89% at a current density up to 2&#160;mA cmelectrode&#8722;2. These metrics represent one of the highest areal capacity, current density, cell voltage, and energy efficiency reported for a metal&#8208;gas cells.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Order and Strong Quantum Coupling Enabled Stable Carrier Transport for Reliable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address memristor reliability issues caused by stochastic carrier transport, long&#8208;range ordered quantum dot (QD) superlattices with strong quantum coupling are constructed via a dual&#8208;ligand strategy, minimizing energetic and positional disorder from atomic&#8208;scale QDs to macroscopic devices. This enhanced coupling surpasses localized quantum&#8208;confined states, ensuring stable, efficient carrier transport and yielding remarkable performance enhancements in neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing based on memristors holds significant potential for performing massively parallel computational tasks with high accuracy. However, its practical application is significantly limited by poor reliability, primarily due to instability in carrier transport. Here, long&#8208;range ordered quantum dot (QD) superlattices with strong quantum coupling is presented to enable carrier transport stability and improve device reliability. Leveraging a data&#8208;assisted QD synthesis optimization loop, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs are synthesized with precisely controlled growth kinetics, crystal orientation, and surface chemistry. These QDs self&#8208;assemble into long&#8208;range ordered superlattices on flexible substrates, achieving a 56% reduction in inter&#8208;dot spacing (to 0.92 nm), aligned lattice orientations, and a 4.4&#8208;fold increase in carrier mobility.

     alt="Long-Range Order and Strong Quantum Coupling Enabled Stable Carrier Transport for Reliable Neuromorphic Computing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address memristor reliability issues caused by stochastic carrier transport, long-range ordered quantum dot (QD) superlattices with strong quantum coupling are constructed via a dual-ligand strategy, minimizing energetic and positional disorder from atomic-scale QDs to macroscopic devices. This enhanced coupling surpasses localized quantum-confined states, ensuring stable, efficient carrier transport and yielding remarkable performance enhancements in neuromorphic computing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio-inspired neuromorphic computing based on memristors holds significant potential for performing massively parallel computational tasks with high accuracy. However, its practical application is significantly limited by poor reliability, primarily due to instability in carrier transport. Here, long-range ordered quantum dot (QD) superlattices with strong quantum coupling is presented to enable carrier transport stability and improve device reliability. Leveraging a data-assisted QD synthesis optimization loop, Cu&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; QDs are synthesized with precisely controlled growth kinetics, crystal orientation, and surface chemistry. These QDs self-assemble into long-range ordered superlattices on flexible substrates, achieving a 56% reduction in inter-dot spacing (to 0.92 nm), aligned lattice orientations, and a 4.4-fold increase in carrier mobility. This architecture enables strong quantum coupling, effectively overcoming the limitations imposed by localized quantum-confined states. As a result, the QD-based memristors exhibit remarkable reliability, with variations below 0.1% over 8.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; s of continuous operation and 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; rapid read cycles. They further demonstrate linear potentiation and depression characteristics (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; = 2.03 and &lt;i&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; = 2.33), a wide conductance range (G&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 264), and high recognition accuracy (93.31%) as validated by chip-level convolutional neural network simulations. This work establishes a robust and flexible platform for memristor-based neuromorphic computing, offering a promising route to overcoming critical challenges in device reliability and computational performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Double&#8208;Drive Water Evaporation&#8208;Induced Generator Operating Without Liquid Water Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique double&#8208;drive WEG (DWEG) is developed with excellent electrical output performance (&gt;1 V, &gt;1 &#181;A cm&#8722;2) in multiple water sources and unveil the corresponding double&#8208;drive operation mechanism. Not limited to liquid water sources, DWEG can also generate sustainable electricity through the spontaneous harvesting of minimal water from the soil, even in low&#8208;temperature (&#8722;12 &#176;C) environments.








Abstract
Restricted electrical output and the heavy reliance on liquid water sources severely limit the further development of water evaporation&#8208;induced generators (WEGs) based on the inherently slow phase transition of water molecules. Here, inspired by the rolling logs to transport boulders, a double&#8208;drive WEG (DWEG) is developed, in which double ionic circulations and ion&#8208;electronic friction provide intensive horsepower and grip for energy capture. DWEGs applied in deionized water can continuously generate a high voltage of 1.13 V and a stable current of 10.54 &#181;A (1.76 &#181;A cm&#8722;2) under ambient conditions (&#8776;20 &#176;C, &#8776;43% RH). In addition, benefiting from the high osmotic pressure and mechanical strength of ionized composite hydrogels, DWEGs can be directly plugged into soil with minimal water (as little as 12.5 wt.%) to generate electricity, eliminating the reliance on a liquid water source. Interestingly, a high electrical output (0.65 V, 0.89 &#181;A) is sustained (&gt;60 h) at low&#8208;temperature (e.g., &#8722;12 &#176;C), overcoming the temporal and geographical restrictions of conventional WEGs in their practical applications.

         <title>Reverse Charge Transfer Drives d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization in Ruthenium&#8211;Oxygen Modified Zn3In2S6 for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the electronegativity difference between oxygen and sulfur element, we designed and implemented ruthenium and oxygen co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6, which achieved controllable reverse photo&#8208;generated charge transfer. This carrier transportation enhanced the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between ruthenium and oxygen, promoting efficient charge redistribution, strong oxygen adsorption and activation, ultimately leading to superior hydrogen peroxide evolution rate.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is emerging as a promising approach for sustainable H2O2 production. However, controlling the electronic structure and charge carrier dynamics to enhance oxygen adsorption and activation remains a major challenge. Here, ruthenium and oxygen co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S&#8326; (O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS) is presented, a catalyst design to achieve reverse photogenerated carrier transfer through tailored electronic modulation. The introduction of oxygen atoms, with higher electronegativity than sulfur, induces significant surface charge redistribution and transforms the Ru&#9472;S coordination environment from Ru&#9472;S4 (in Ru&#8208;ZIS) to Ru&#8208;S&#8321;O3 (in O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS), as revealed by synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (SR&#8208;XAS). This structural transition drives a reversal in charge carrier transfer pathways: in Ru&#8208;ZIS, photogenerated electrons transfer from Ru sites to In sites, whereas in O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS, electrons transfer from In sites to Ru sites, as validated by in situ XPS and fs&#8208;TA spectra. This reverse charge transfer enhances d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between Ru and O2, facilitating efficient charge redistribution, strong oxygen adsorption, and activation. In situ spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further corroborate these mechanistic insights. As a result, the O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS catalyst exhibits a photocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 3659&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ambient conditions without requiring sacrificial agents, significantly outperforming conventional Zn3In2S6&#8208;based systems and other reported photocatalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>Unveiling Scale&#8208;Design Principle at Electrical Confinement Materials for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a new design paradigm for electrical confinement materials (ECMs) aimed at water purification, utilizing the energy equivalence design principle to achieve optimized reaction kinetics efficacy. This approach provides a scalable strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance ECMs, effectively overcoming the limitations associated with small&#8208;scale material synthesis and enhancing anti&#8208;fouling capabilities in response to environmental disturbances.








Abstract
Electrochemical water treatment is a promising sustainable environmental remediation technology due to its eco&#8208;friendliness, ease of control, and significant effectiveness in degrading organic pollutants. The electrical confinement materials (ECMs) exhibit enhanced mass transfer characteristics that substantially reduce energy consumption and reaction time within the system. In this study, the design strategies of ECMs are evaluated from the perspective of trade&#8208;offs in equivalent energy drives, including pressure&#8208;driven and electric&#8208;driven forms. The reaction efficiency and the potential for interface anti&#8208;fouling are investigated across confined spatial scales. These findings indicate that, in scenarios characterized by the equivalent energy input principle, the ECMs can effectively address the challenges associated with material spatial scale design. This advancement facilitates the achievement of energy equivalence in the water purification process, particularly in addressing significant application challenges related to loading catalytic layers within confined channels. The result on the anti&#8208;fouling potential of ECMs indicates that an interface oxidation mechanism dominated by hydroxyl radicals is more effective in resisting electrode deactivation caused by dissolved natural polymers in the water matrix. This study offers key insights for designing anti&#8208;fouling and energy&#8208;saving interfaces with efficient mass transfer in water treatment, enhancing the potential of electrochemical methods.

         <title>Molecularly Programmed Twisting in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Crystal Enables Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic crystal is reported to exhibit extraordinary anhydrous superprotonic conductivity for promising application as a solid electrolyte in high&#8208;temperature fuel cells.








Abstract
A Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Crystal (HOC&#8208;88) is reported that achieves unprecedented anhydrous superprotonic conductivity through a molecular topology&#8208;driven hierarchical assembly strategy. Single&#8208;crystal analysis uncovers a saddle&#8208;distorted &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomer with eight phenolic hydroxyl groups, whose synergistic geometric confinement enables spontaneous formation of self&#8208;templated 3D proton highways&#8208;a phenomenon yet to be observed in crystalline organic conductors. The double torsion of the &#960;&#8208;system induces helical cooperativity between hydrogen&#8208;bonded lamellae and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked columns, generating interconnected proton pathways with negative thermal expansion behavior along the c&#8208;axis. This unique mechanism allows HOC&#8208;88 to maintain ultrastable proton conduction without humidity dependence, surpassing all known HOCs and routing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF/COF analogues. Crucially, the framework demonstrates chemical omniphobicity&#8208;retaining crystallinity in boiling water (100 &#176;C), concentrated acid (0.5&#160;m H2SO4 and 1&#160;m HCl), and 300&#160;&#176;C in air conditions. When deployed in an H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell prototype, it establishes the first experimental evidence of HOC operating in practical high&#8208;temperature electrochemical devices. The findings reveal that controlled helical distortion in &#960;&#8208;systems can programmatically dictate long&#8208;range proton ordering, opening an unexplored dimension for designing next&#8208;generation solid electrolytes.

Crucially, the framework demonstrates chemical omniphobicity-retaining crystallinity in boiling water (100 &#176;C), concentrated acid (0.5&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; HCl), and 300&#160;&#176;C in air conditions. When deployed in an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cell prototype, it establishes the first experimental evidence of HOC operating in practical high-temperature electrochemical devices. The findings reveal that controlled helical distortion in &#960;-systems can programmatically dictate long-range proton ordering, opening an unexplored dimension for designing next-generation solid electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) hold great promise for use in a wide range of biomedical applications. This review covers four stimulus modalities, namely, electrical, optical, magnetic, and ultrasound, and their associated SRMs. It provides a summary of the materials in each modality, their development, and current research perspectives. This review also provides a detailed analysis of the key challenges for translating these SRM technologies into clinical use.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) are materials that change properties when exposed to external or internal stimuli. They respond to physiological changes within cells and tissues, as well as external triggers including light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity. In medicine, SRMs have diverse applications spanning drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostics. They enable targeted drug release at specific times and locations, facilitate tissue generation and repair, and enhance disease detection capabilities. Beyond medical uses, SRMs are employed in smart coatings and artificial muscle systems. The breadth of biomedical applications for SRMs is extensive, generating substantial research into novel and innovative material development. Challenges in creating safe and efficient SRMs for medical treatments have driven innovative approaches in two key areas: functionalizing and modifying naturally occurring materials and developing new synthetic nanomaterials. The complexity of producing effective SRMs has necessitated creative solutions to overcome safety and efficiency barriers in medical applications. This ongoing research continues to expand the potential therapeutic uses of these responsive materials. This review examines literature focused on SRM development for external stimuli responses, particularly light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity, rather than covering the complete spectrum of stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

         <title>A Flexible and Repairable Ultra&#8208;Broadband Electromagnetic Wave Absorber by Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the working principle of membrane&#8208;free organelles for the construction of biological cells, a self&#8208;assembly strategy of photopolymerization&#8208;induced phase transition driving liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is proposed to construct conductive nanochannels and abundant heterogeneous interface for the repairable and durable ultra&#8211;broadband electromagnetic wave absorber (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;dB from 5 to 40&#8201;GHz).








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;broadband electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption depends on the balance of impedance matching and attenuation, which heavily rely on the structural integrity via rigorous production process or extreme reaction condition, constraining their applications particularly in biomedicine and flexible electronics. Here, a simple one&#8208;step method is proposed to access a flexible and repairable ultra&#8208;broadband EMW absorber by the photopolymerization of one common monomer in ionic liquid. The liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation process of poly (N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) and ionic liquid results in a high polymer content network comprising conductive nanochannels intertwined with abundant polymer chain/ionic liquid heterogeneous interface (basic unit &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm). This strategy effectively achieves&#160;the balance of impedance matching and attenuation, and accesses the broadest effective absorption band in the single&#8208;layer absorbers (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;dB from 5 to 40&#8201;GHz). Moreover, the resultant polymer absorbers have high fracture strength (&#8776;8.2&#160;MPa), fracture energy (&#8776;774 kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and transparency (&#8776;85%), while being highly stretchable (&#8776;900% strain) and having repairable microwave absorption (&#8776;97% repaired in effective absorption bandwidth). Overall, this work provides a general strategy for the fabrication of ultra&#8208;broadband EMW absorbers, which will promote potential advances in flexible electromagnetic materials.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Intrinsic Constraint Boosts Slow&#8208;Thermalization and Fast&#8208;Transfer of Carriers in FAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy utilizing a strain&#8208;induced intrinsic constraint with triamino&#8208;linear GA&#8208;acid is implemented to create anisotropic surface strain (&#603; = 0.53%&#8211;0.78%) on QDs for stabilizing the perovskite lattice. Simultaneously, modulation of Pb&#8208;I/O bonding and Pb&#8208;Pb spacing optimizes nonadiabatic coupling and enhances charge carrier transfer. Finally, FAPbI3 QDSCs achieved a PCE of 17.11%, while retaining 81.4% of initial PCE after 1000 h of aging.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide quantum dots (FAPbI3 QDs) are extensively utilized in photovoltaic applications due to their superior optoelectronic characteristics. Nonetheless, the weak ionic bonds within their soft lattice structure lead to structural deformation, which causes a disordered charge distribution of FAPbI3 QDs. Stress engineering not only can mitigate the inherent soft lattice by reinforcing ion bonds but also can promote electron localization, thus enhancing charge carrier transfer. This work introduces a strain&#8208;induced intrinsic constraint (SIC) strategy that employs steric bulk modulation of nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands to induce anisotropic surface strain (&#603; = 0.53&#8211;0.78) in FAPbI3 QDs. By systematically designing nitrogen&#8208;coordinating ligands, guanidinium acetate (GA&#8208;acid) is demonstrated to facilitate controlled anisotropic lattice strain by filling A&#8208;site vacancies while simultaneously establishing a self&#8208;reinforcing stress, which effectively strengthens the antibonding interaction of Pb&#8208;O/I and reduces Pb&#8208;Pb orbital overlap, resulting in &#8220;slow&#8208;thermalization and fast&#8208;transfer&#8221; synergy for enhanced charge transfer. The PQDSCs engineered using the SIC approach achieve a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 17.11% and a highest short&#8208;circuit current density of 20.96 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. It is anticipated that stress&#8208;induced modulation of nanocrystals offers a critical insight for advancing the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Additive with Multinary Interactions to Perovskite Precursor Species for Catalyzed Crystallization of Antisolvent&#8208;Free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel additive, parecoxib (Pr), is presented to catalyze &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystallization in the antisolvent&#8208;free processes via multinary interactions to the precursor species. This measure provides effective regulation of perovskite crytallization, suppression of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, and passivation of grain boundaries. The as&#8208;made Cs&#8208;free FAPbI3 solar cell reaches a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.38%.








Abstract
Antisolvent&#8208;free processes exhibit numerous advantages for fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) while requiring exquisite control of nucleation and crystallization of perovskite film. Without the addition of Cs and Br species, more obstacles are faced for the preferred &#945;&#8208;phase pure formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. In this work, a novel additive, parecoxib (Pr), is proposed, which catalyzes the direct crystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 through multinary interactions with the solvate perovskite precursor. Detailed molecular interactions and in situ analysis reveal that Pr provides nucleation sites, reduces the grain growth rate, suppresses the formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, and ultimately enhances the quality of the perovskite film. Furthermore, Pr can in situ passivate the grain boundaries, reduce nonradiative recombination, and enhance open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.195&#160;V. As a result, high&#8208;performance antisolvent&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSCs are achieved with the PCE reaching 25.38% and 19.64% for mini&#8208;modules (93&#160;cm2). The unencapsulated device maintains 91.08% of the initial PCE for 1000&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C, and 90.62% after 1000&#160;h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Suppressing Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss in Perovskite Solar Cells via Ligand&#8208;Assisted Crystallization Dynamics Regulation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additive (NH4SCN) ligands&#8208;assisted perovskite crystallization dynamics regulation strategy is investigated in this work. Which is proved to modulate both the nucleation and crystal growth progresses synchronously in virtue of the interaction affinity between NH4+/ SCN&#8208; ligands and the Pb&#9472;I framework or FA+. Ultimately, perovskite films with superior optoelectronic characteristics are achieved accompanied by a satisfactory performance of relevant PSCs.








Abstract
Despite the dazzling progress since the emergence of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a significant ideal&#8208;reality discrepancy with respect to the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) still reminds the primarily weak parameter, inducing the limited power conversion efficiency (PCE) relative to its Shockley&#8208;Queisser theoretical limit. Eliminating the detrimental non&#8208;radiative recombination centers enriched at the surface/grain boundaries of perovskite films is generally regarded as the key approaches to bridge this gap. Herein, a perovskite crystallization dynamic regulation template is conducted to ensure the realization of both rapid nucleation and suppressed crystal growth through the synchronous incorporation of SCN&#8722; and volatility NH4+ ligands. Thereby promoting the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with enlarged grain size, superior crystallinity, ordered surface texture and compensated residual strain. Notably, residual SCN&#8722; ligands detected in the buried interface of perovskite films is also inclined to serves as an interface passivators. In conjunction with the above analysis, desired perovskite films with decreased defect density and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination are acquired for the NH4SCN sample, leading to impressive power conversion efficiencies of 26.13% with one of the lowest VOC losses among all reported p&#8208;i&#8208;n structure PSCs, reaching 96.13% of their theoretical VOC limit.

         <title>Multimodal Actuation and Precise Control in Liquid Crystal Elastomer Optical Fiber Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LCE optical fiber artificial muscles achieve 40% contraction with precise waveguide control. By being integrated into bundles, LCEOFs exhibit multimodal actuation, including long&#8208;distance contraction (&#8805;5&#160;cm), sustaining weightlifting (&gt;4000 times their own&#160;weight), omnidirectional bending (0&#8211;360&#176;), and wide&#8208;range torsion (0&#8211;180&#176;). Furthermore, the LCEOFs can be easily integrated into artificial hands and robotic systems for delicate, coordinated tasks in confined spaces.








Abstract
Artificial muscles mimicking the fibrous structure and functionalities of natural skeletal muscles have garnered substantial interest for applications in actuators, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. However, achieving multidirectional actuation and delicate manipulation in confined environments remains challenging. Inspired by the neuromuscular system, a novel liquid crystal elastomer optical fiber (LCEOF) is introduced as artificial muscle with multimodal actuation and precise control. Fabricated through a two&#8208;step process, the LCEOFs possess sufficient orientation order (0.65) and low optical transmission loss (0.37&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1), enabling over 40% contraction strain with minimal ambient interference. Bundling multiple LCEOFs yields artificial arms capable of complicated and controllable deformations, including long&#8208;distance contraction (&#8805;5&#160;cm), weightlifting (&gt;4000 times their own weight), wide&#8208;range torsion (0&#8211;180&#176;), and omnidirectional bending (0&#8211;360&#176;). Multimodal actuation is precisely and independently regulated via terminal&#8208;coupled laser inputs for each LCEOF in bundled arrays, enabling coordinated, crosstalk&#8208;free motions. These optical fiber artificial muscles allow precise and controllable operation of an artificial hand for grasping and manipulating objects, without reliance on free&#8208;space lateral illumination. Additionally, robotics systems incorporating bundles of LCEOFs have been designed and demonstrated for tasks such as laser writing and object transfer in confined environments, thereby offering new possibilities for the advancement of smart actuators.

This study synthesized innovative UV&#8208;responsive polyurethanes (NPE&#8208;PUs) containing azobenzene units and ionic liquid units, based on nanophotoelectric effect. The generators (NPEGs) from NPE&#8208;PUs rapidly yielded 36.57 V electrical signals under UV light. A 9 &#215; 9 matrix of 81 NPEGs, mimicking human vision, achieved 96.22% accuracy in item identification. This comprehensive system advances bionic visual recognition and artificial intelligence fields.








Abstract
Artificial photoreceptors utilizing piezoelectric polymers and semiconductors can convert external mechanical deformations, forces, or changes in light into electrical signals, making them essential for advanced optoelectronic sensors and smart wearable devices. However, this approach faces several challenges, including slow response time, weak signal, and high power consumption. This study synthesizes a series of polyurethanes containing azobenzene&#8208;based photoisomer units and ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based dipole units (comprising loose cation&#8211;anion pairs) based on the nanophotoelectric effect, wherein ultraviolet light induces isomerization of photoisomer segments and generates dynamic dipoles, creating equal amounts of charges with opposite signs at the electrodes. The nanophotoelectric generator achieves open&#8208;circuit voltage of 37 V, short&#8208;circuit current of 265 &#181;A, and rapid response time of 7.5 &#181;s under UV illumination. Furthermore, 81 individual nanophotoelectric generators are integrated into a 9 &#215; 9 pixel array for a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted system to accurately (96.22%) recognize different items, like human vision; it simultaneously executes super&#8208;resolution refinement on the acquired pixel images, further improving the identification results. Precise, efficient intelligent object recognition is thus attained through material innovation, and a comprehensive system is established that encompasses azobenzene&#8211;ionic&#8208;liquid copolymer preparation, device assembly, integration, signal acquisition, and machine learning, offering novel insights into bionic visual recognition systems.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Liquid Crystal Polymer Actuators: From Alignment Regulation to Nano&#8208;composition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators appears as a bridge between artificial systems and the natural biological intelligence. Here, an overview of the development and cutting&#8208;edge advancements is provided in nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators, focusing on how alignment regulation and nano&#8208;composition influence their actuation modes and performance. Furthermore, an outlook is proposed for the LCP actuators closer to actual biological muscles and their potential in soft robotics.








Abstract
Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) that possess crosslinked networks and ordered alignment of mesogens are renowned for their large and reversible anisotropic deformation in response to external stimuli, which holds great potential in the burgeoning field of nature&#8208;inspired actuators and robots. Continuous efforts have been made in revealing the interplay between materials chemistry, processing, and alignment of LCPs, to broaden the actuation modes and enhance the actuation performance toward practical utilization. In this review, the advances in nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators is focused with special attentions devoted in their mesogen alignment and the macroscopic geometry. Since the mesogen alignment is vital for the attainable actuation modes, the methods for alignment regulating are detailly combed, including surface&#8208;enforced alignment, field&#8208;assisted alignment, mechanical alignment, rheological alignment, and self&#8208;assembly. Subsequently, the composition of nanomaterials is futher surveyed in LCP actuators with a focus on enhancing the actuation performance. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends are discussed, which may shed light on future investigations.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mechanoluminescence of Pr3+&#8208;Doped Perovskite Oxide for 3D Strain Sensing and Visualization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pr3+&#8208;doped perovskite oxide (NaTaO3) that exhibits ultrasensitive mechanoluminescence (ML) responses with a deformation detection limit of 0.01% is developed in this work. Impressively, its potential for the real&#8208;time, recoverable, and visual strain sensing capabilities in 3D spaces is verified, providing an exemplary application in advanced strain sensing and visualization at microscopic and multidimensional scales.








Abstract
Owing to the unique mechano&#8208;optical response, mechanoluminescence (ML) materials possess dynamic, sensitive, visual, and recoverable strain sensing capabilities. However, the dilemma of lacking outstanding ML materials with high detection precision under micro deformations still exists, thereby hindering advanced applications in multi&#8208;angle and multidimensional scenarios. Herein, a novel Pr3+&#8208;doped perovskite oxide (NaTaO3:Pr3+)&#8208;based composite elastic thin film is developed, which achieves ultrasensitive ML responses to both microscale compressive and tensile strains. Compared with the record of LiTaO3:Tb3+, the corresponding deformation detection limit has been improved by five times, reaching 0.01%, which is comparable to the performance of the widely used piezoresistive and capacitive sensors. The results reveal that the ML originates from the interaction between adjacent defects and the varying local piezoelectric fields near PrNaO9 and PrTaO6 polyhedra. Most notably, the strain and ML demonstrate identical distributions on a 3D&#8208;printed model coated with NaTaO3:Pr3+ thin film even under micro deformation less than 0.4%, highlighting the significant potential of NaTaO3:Pr3+ for advanced 3D microstrain sensing applications. This work provides convincing insights into the investigation of ML mechanisms through local trap and piezoelectricity analyses, along with an exemplificative application in advanced strain sensing and visualization at microscopic and multidimensional scales.

         <title>Strong Coupling of NiOx and Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules via Inserted Reductant for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reducing molecules enhance coverage density of self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAM) by forming strong coupling with both NiOx and SAMs, thereby improving interfacial carrier extraction and suppressing interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination. Hence, the as&#8208;proposed device obtains a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.34% and impressive operational stability (97.5% initial PCE retention rate for 1000&#160;h).








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) deposited on nickel oxide (NiOx) are the basis for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, the dissolution and redeposition of SAMs caused by the perovskite precursors leads to leaky monolayers, resulting in perovskite degradation and reduced stability. Here, a novel method is reported to realize strong coupling between NiOx and SAMs via inserted reductant [9tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)] for an integrated NiOx&#8208;SAMs hole transport layer (HTL). TCEP reduces NiOx and in situ forms C&#9552;O&#183;&#183;&#183;Ni coordinated bond and O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9472;Ni hydrogen bond, while its &#8208;COOH is connected with SAM's &#8208;PO(OH)2 by phosphonate and hydrogen bond, which improve the compactness of SAMs, thereby strengthening hole extraction and lowering interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination. Simulation calculations demonstrate that the HTL strongly coupled by TCEP has a stronger adsorption energy, significantly improving device long&#8208;term stability. Therefore, the device based on integrated NiOx&#8208;SAMs HTL obtains a substantial efficiency of 26.34%. The devices maintain an impressive 97.5% of their original efficiency after 1000 h of operation under 1&#8208;sun illumination and 90.1% after 1000 h of thermal treatment at 85&#160;&#176;C in nitrogen atmosphere. This work offers new horizons for designing NiOx&#8208;based HTLs with high SAMs coverage for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Overcoming Material Incompatibility via 2D Free&#8208;Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable post&#8208;epitaxial strategy introduces a sub&#8208;nanometric 2D free surface (2DFS) at the heterointerface, effectively decoupling lattice&#8208;mismatched layers. This process significantly reduces strain&#8208;driven defects and dislocation density in Ge/Si heterostructures. The resulting bulk&#8208;like material quality, validated by advanced microscopy and optical analyses, opens new pathways for high&#8208;performance heteroepitaxy across micro&#8208; and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxy has been pivotal in advancing both optoelectronics and microelectronics, driving the development of faster, more efficient devices across diverse applications. However, achieving high material quality remains challenging due to lattice mismatches. Strain induced by variations in lattice parameters and thermal properties provides additional degrees of freedom for material tailoring but often leads to dislocation generation, wafer bowing, and cracking. These issues are addressed through a scalable post&#8208;epitaxial approach that strategically targets the misfit dislocation network, leading to the creation of a sub&#8208;nanometric 2D free surface (2DFS). This interface effectively decouples the epilayer from the substrate, significantly reducing strain&#8208;related defects. Scalable heterostructures exhibited pronounced defect annihilation, as demonstrated by electron microscopy, defect etching, and photoluminescence analysis&#8212;an effect attributed to the surrounding free surfaces. This method strikes an optimal balance between bulk&#8208;quality characteristics and high surface integrity, offering a new paradigm for achieving heteroepitaxial bulk&#8208;class materials.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Buffered Sulfidation Stabilized B&#948;&#8722; in 1T MoS2: Orbital Alignment for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molybdenum aluminum boride&#8208;guided charge&#8208;buffered sulfidation strategy is proposed to stabilize anionic boron&#160;(B&#948;&#8722;) dopants in metallic phase molybdenum disulfide. The B&#948;&#8722; substitution not only generates a high&#8208;energy&#8208;state of empty pz orbital to unlock the rapid H2O dissociation, but also facilitates the H adsorption through modulating the electronic environment of adjacent sulfur, hence improving alkaline HER performance.








Abstract
The sp3 hybridization of surface sulfur in&#160;metallic phase molybdenum disulfide (1T MoS2) is identified as the intrinsic bottleneck for alkaline hydrogen production (HER), where their electron&#8208;saturated nature elevates the kinetic barrier for water dissociation. To overcome this limitation, a charge&#8208;buffered sulfidation strategy is reported to stabilize anionic boron (B&#948;&#8722;) within 1T MoS2. By employing molybdenum aluminum boride as the precursor, the B&#948;&#8722; dopants can be efficiently preserved via the topological confinement imposed by Mo&#9472;B&#9472;Mo network. This approach also maintains the 1T phase integrity through Al&#8208;mediated electron compensation. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that B&#948;&#8722; substitution generates vertically oriented empty pz orbitals through sp2 hybridization, which elevates orbital energy to align with molecular orbitals of water, significantly reducing the O&#9472;H cleavage barrier by over 80% compared to 1T MoS2. Concurrently, the B&#9472;Mo&#9472;S networks upshift adjacent sulfur 3p band centers to optimize the hydrogen adsorption path. These dual functionalities endow the pz&#8208;functionalized 1T MoS2 with a low overpotential of &#8722;30&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and high&#8208;current operation of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.779&#160;V in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane electrolytic cell. This work not only establishes orbital alignment as a transformative design principle for advanced electrocatalysts, but also paves a novel synthetic pathway for 1T transition metal disulfides.

         <title>Hyaluronic Acid with Double Helix Ion Channels for Efficient Electrolyte Retention and Polysulfide Regulation in Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural moisturizing material, hyaluronic acid, is developed to enhance electrolyte adsorption and polysulfide capture via intramolecular hydrogen bonds, eliminate polysulfides by its superior radical&#8208;scavenging capability, and expedite electron/Li+ transport by spiral acceleration effect, thus boosting sulfur redox reaction kinetics and achieving outstanding electrochemical performance of lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Catalyzing sulfur conversion is an efficient solution to overcome poor ion transfer, severe shuttle effect, and unfavored electrode passivation in lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein, a natural moisturizing material, hyaluronic acid (HA), is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated to promote the adsorptions of electrolyte and polysulfides via intramolecular hydrogen bonds, providing sufficient electrolyte contacts for subsequent catalytic reactions. Rely on its radical&#8208;scavenging capability, HA facilitates the conversion of polysulfide radicals at N sites, suppressing shuttle effect. Due to the spiral acceleration effect of double helix structure, HA accelerates Li+ migration, enhancing the lithiation kinetics of system. Consequently, under sulfur loading of 8 mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte of 3 &#181;L mg&#8722;1 conditions, the HA&#8208;modified cells deliver a high areal capacity of 11.76 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a gravimetric energy density of 409 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides a fresh insight into developing natural moisturizing materials as electrocatalysts toward practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Electrostatically Enhanced Buried Interface Binding of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Efficient And Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In p&#8208;i&#8208;n structure perovskite solar cells, conventional self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) such as [2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) exhibit limited buried interfacial adhesion, compromising device stability. A donor&#8208;acceptor SAM, 4&#8208;(7&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino&#8208;2,5&#8208;difluorophenyl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzoic acid (PAFTB), featuring an enhanced dipole moment and tailored functional groups, improves adhesion by 2.8 times, thereby enhancing both stability and efficiency of the devices. 








Abstract
Inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have outperformed traditional n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs in recent years. A key advancement is the use of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole transport layers. One class of widely used SAMs is carbazole&#8208;based phosphonic acids. However, it is found that these SAMs lack strong binding with transparent conducting oxides (TCO) and perovskite. The weak binding strength results in suboptimal interfacial adhesion of the buried interface, which limits the device's stability. Here, interfacial binding is enhanced by increasing the dipole moment that creates a strong interfacial electric field that enhances electrostatic interactions at the TCO/perovskite interface, while incorporating tailored functional groups in SAMs to improve chemical anchoring to TCO and binding to perovskite. Specifically, the donor&#8208;acceptor SAM molecule 4&#8208;(7&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)&#8208;2,5&#8208;difluorophenyl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzoic acid (PAFTB) is employed, which features an enhanced dipole moment along with electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups to optimize interfacial interactions. Compared to extensively used [2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz), PAFTB enhances total interfacial adhesion by 2.8 times, thereby improving the thermal stability of the layer. Using this approach, PSCs are demonstrated with a certified quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state power conversion efficiency of 24.9% and maintain 80% of the&#160;initial efficiency after 900&#160;h of maximum power point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x/Ag Photocatalyst for the Fixation of N2 from Air with the Solar Energy Conversion Efficiency Reaching over 0.28%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x/Ag photocatalyst is designed for efficient N2 photofixation. It exhibits superior light absorption, a Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free feature, and plasmonic photothermal conversion. A diphase reaction platform is designed by loading the photocatalyst in a polymer film to suppress the light absorption of water and accelerate the mass transfer kinetics, giving a high photocatalytic efficiency of &gt;0.28% from air.








Abstract
Storing solar energy in chemical bonds through photocatalysis under ambient conditions is of great importance for sustainable development and carbon neutrality. In addition to the design of new photocatalysts with high activities, efficient solar energy delivery and the acceleration of reactant mass transfer kinetics are also crucial for efficient energy conversion. Herein, a new type of plasmonic Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free MoO3&#8722;x/Ag photocatalyst is designed for efficient NH3 production. The photocatalyst exhibits strong light absorption and utilization under sunlight illumination. The construction of a bilayer system reduces the light attenuation by water in the near&#8208;infrared region and accelerates the N2 mass transfer kinetics. As a result, the photocatalytic activity is largely boosted. A high solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency of over 0.28% (&#177;0.01%) is reached with air directly used as the feeding gas. The study offers a promising pathway for the rational design of photocatalysts and photocatalytic platforms, enabling greatly enhanced solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

Large&#8208;format fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (L&#8208;FLIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation flexible and wearable electronics but suffer significant cell polarization and insufficient active material utilization after scaling up. The heterogeneous spatial electric field distribution fundamentally affects the electrochemical behavior and jeopardizes the performance of L&#8208;FLIBs, yet its influence on 1D fiber structures remains unexplored. Here, the electron transport mechanisms are systematically investigated and develop an optimized dual&#8208;terminal cell configuration for field homogenizing. Through equivalent circuit modeling and experimental validation, it is revealed that strategic electron collection terminal design establishes symmetric electric fields along the fiber length, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of electrochemical heterogeneity and enhancing the redox kinetics for L&#8208;FLIBs. Thereby, a 60% internal resistance reduction is achieved and successfully fabricated a 10&#8208;m&#8208;long L&#8208;FLIBs with an unprecedented 1 Ah high capacity for a single fiber cell. The practical capability of this design is demonstrated by integrating large&#8208;format batteries into a fabric power bank for portable electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Large-format fiber lithium-ion batteries (L-FLIBs) beyond 2 m in length are developed by homogenizing the electric field along fiber axis. The as-assembled L-FLIBs can deliver a 0.4 W high power output, corresponding to a 40% power increment. Furthermore, an unprecedented single-cell capacity of &amp;gt;1 Ah is achieved.

         <title>Enhancing the Operational Lifetime of OLEDs Through the Modulation of Rigidity and Excited&#8208;State Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategic molecular design utilizing fused B/N and C &#9552; O/N units within the MR&#8208;TADF framework to enhance molecular rigidity and accelerate RISC, resulting in efficient sky&#8208;blue OLEDs. BNTO&#8208;based hyper&#8208;fluorescence OLEDs achieved a moderate EQE of 19.4% and a LT70 of 500 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, emphasizing the importance of structural rigidification and excited&#8208;state engineering for color purity and stability.








Abstract
Blue&#8208;emitting multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), high robustness with short&#8208;lived emission lifetime is particularly desired for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, a series of MR&#8208;TADF molecules featuring fused boron/nitrogen (B/N) and C &#9552; O/N frameworks is reported. These emitters namely BNO, BNDO, and BNTO are systematically designed and synthesized to investigate the impact of molecular rigidity or planarity toward their excited&#8208;state dynamics through stepwise intramolecular electrophilic acylation reactions. Computational studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data revealed the enhanced planarity of BNDO and BNTO. Upon photoexcitation, these compounds exhibited blue emission with PLQYs of approaching unity and short&#8208;lived delayed lifetimes (&lt;2 &#181;s). BNTO&#8208;based OLEDs achieved sky&#8208;blue emission peaking at 489 nm, a moderate device operational lifetime of over 500 h at 70% of the initial brightness (LT70) at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, which shows longer device stability when compared with BNO and greener emission when compared to BNDO. This study highlights that manipulation of the rigidity of compounds and emissive states of MR&#8208;TADF compounds is essential in achieving blue emission and improving OLED operational stability.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Directed Assembly in Achiral Point Groups for Circularly Polarized Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports two compounds crystallizing in achiral point groups (2/m and 1&#175;$\bar{1}$) that exhibit circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the synergistic effect of intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonding during crystallization induces symmetry breaking, facilitating directed helical assembly. The photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) reach 5.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (543 nm) and 4.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2 (550 nm), respectively.








Abstract
Very recently, considerable attention has been given to pure organic circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (CP&#8208;RTP) materials due to their unique photophysical properties. However, the directed construction of optically active phosphorescent signals within achiral systems remains a formidable challenge. In this study, two achiral crystals, 2CN4S and 2F4S, belonging to the achiral point groups 2/m and 1&#175;$\bar{1}$, exhibit strong CP&#8208;RTP emission with high photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) up to 5.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (543 nm) and 4.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (550 nm), respectively. This phenomenon is attributed to the intrinsic mirror&#8208;antiparallel molecular conformations induced by the targeted substitution of cyano/fluoro groups, which spontaneously assemble into symmetry&#8208;breaking helical superstructures through synergistic C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This work not only establishes a novel approach for CP&#8208;RTP material design but also overcomes structural constraints in optically active materials within achiral point group systems.

         <title>Stretchable, Adhesive, Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel Electrolytes with Dual&#8208;Functional Water Regulation Enabled by Amide Group&#8211;Salt&#8211;Water Interactions for All&#8208;Climate Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A stretchable, adhesive, anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel electrolyte with dual&#8208;functional water regulation is constructed via a one&#8208;pot strategy, integrating acetate anions and the hydrophilic amide groups on polyacrylamide chains. This design disrupts the intrinsic water hydrogen&#8208;bond network and suppresses interfacial side reactions, enabling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries to operate over a broad temperature range spanning from &#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and environmental compatibility. However, parasitic reactions induced by active water molecules in conventional aqueous electrolytes severely degrade electrochemical performance and cycling stability. Herein, a stretchable, adhesive, anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel electrolyte with dual&#8208;functional water regulation is synthesized via a one&#8208;pot radical polymerization strategy, where acetate (Ac&#8722;) anions and hydrophilic amide (&#9472;CONH2) groups on polyacrylamide (PAM) chains synergistically regulate water activity. This design disrupts water's intrinsic hydrogen bond network and suppresses interfacial side reactions, enabling stable AZIBs operation across a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). Consequently, Zn||Cu cells employing PAM&#8208;Zn(Ac)2&#8208;4KAc (denoted PAM&#8208;ZnK4Ac) hydrogel electrolyte achieve an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 500 cycles, demonstrating outstanding reversibility. Meanwhile, Zn||polyaniline (PANI) cells retain 81.4% capacity after 1100 cycles at &#8722;20 &#176;C and operate effectively up to 100 &#176;C. This work establishes a facile yet effective strategy for preparing hydrogel electrolytes, advancing all&#8208;climate AZIBs toward extreme&#8208;environment energy storage and flexible electronics.

         <title>A Perspective on High&#8208;Entropy Oxides as Potential Electromagnetic Wave Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Perspective comprehensively reviews the research progress of high&#8208;entropy oxides as electromagnetic wave absorbing materials from four aspects: high&#8208;entropy characteristics, crystal structure, synthesis methods, and elemental composition. The key scientific issues that urgently need attention at present and the development are proposed, aiming to provide insights for high&#8208;entropy oxides to become the next generation of promising electromagnetic wave absorbing materials.








Abstract
The escalating impact of electromagnetic radiation on human health and electronic device stability has driven intensive research into advanced electromagnetic wave absorption (EMA) materials in recent decades. Among them, high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) have evolved into increasingly popular research in the material field since they were first reported in 2015. They are particularly promising for EMA applications due to their remarkable tunability and almost infinite compositional flexibility. The advantages of HEOs as EMA material from four key aspects are systematically clarified: the intrinsic properties of the high&#8208;entropy system, crystal structure, compositional design, and synthesis strategies. A forward&#8208;looking view on the future development of HEOs in EMA is highlighted, demonstrating six crucial points: dielectric genes, high&#8208;throughput computational methods, material integration strategies, microstructural modulation, the high&#8208;entropy concept expansion, and functional expansion. This perspective offers theoretical insights and technological references to advance high&#8208;performance HEO research by systematically connecting the HEO family and EMA functionality.

They are particularly promising for EMA applications due to their remarkable tunability and almost infinite compositional flexibility. The advantages of HEOs as EMA material from four key aspects are systematically clarified: the intrinsic properties of the high-entropy system, crystal structure, compositional design, and synthesis strategies. A forward-looking view on the future development of HEOs in EMA is highlighted, demonstrating six crucial points: dielectric genes, high-throughput computational methods, material integration strategies, microstructural modulation, the high-entropy concept expansion, and functional expansion. This perspective offers theoretical insights and technological references to advance high-performance HEO research by systematically connecting the HEO family and EMA functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TriMag Microrobots: 3D&#8208;Printed Microrobots for Magnetic Actuation, Imaging, and Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TriMag microrobots are two&#8208;photon polymerized hydrogel structures embedded with in situ synthesized Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, enabling magnetic actuation, high&#8208;resolution magnetic particle imaging (MPI), and efficient magnetothermal heating for deep&#8208;tissue biomedical interventions including tracking, navigation, and tumor ablation.








Abstract
Microrobots hold immense potential in biomedical applications, including drug delivery, disease diagnostics, and minimally invasive surgeries. However, two key challenges hinder their clinical translation: achieving scalable and precision fabrication, and enabling non&#8208;invasive imaging and tracking within deep biological tissues. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI), a cutting&#8208;edge imaging modality, addresses these challenges by detecting the magnetization of nanoparticles and visualizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) with sub&#8208;millimeter resolution, free from interference by biological tissues. This capability makes MPI an ideal tool for tracking magnetic microrobots in deep tissue environments. In this study, &#8220;TriMag&#8221; microrobots are introduced: 3D&#8208;printed microrobots with three integrated magnetic functionalities&#8212;magnetic actuation, magnetic particle imaging, and magnetic hyperthermia. The TriMag microrobots are fabricated using an innovative method that combines two&#8208;photon lithography for 3D printing biocompatible hydrogel structures with in situ chemical reactions to embed the hydrogel scaffold with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for good MPI contrast and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles for efficient magnetothermal heating. This approach enables scalable, precise fabrication of helical magnetic hydrogel microrobots. The resulting TriMag microrobots, with the synergistic effects of Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, demonstrate efficient magnetic actuation for controlled movement, precise imaging via MPI for imaging and tracking in biological fluid and organs, including porcine eye and mouse stomach, and magnetothermal heating for tumor ablation in a mouse model. By combining these capabilities, the fabrication and imaging approach provides a robust platform for non&#8208;invasive monitoring and manipulation of microrobots for transformative applications in medical treatment and biological research.

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein Mimicking Nanodiscs with Pt(IV) Prodrug Enable Tumor Targeting and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway Activation for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodisc, referred as sHDL@Pt, is engineered to load a Pt(IV) prodrug (C2&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;C12), activating the innate immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Using near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence imaging and single photon emission computed tomography imaging technology, it is found that sHDL@Pt can be effectively accumulated in tumor sites.








Abstract
Cisplatin is a first&#8208;line, broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;tumor drug used to treat various types of cancer. However, immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) are often induced by cisplatin. Here, a first synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodisc, referred as sHDL@Pt, is engineered to load a Pt(IV) prodrug (C2&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;C12), inducing a 2.2&#8208;fold increase in dsDNA release compared to cisplatin. This further activates the innate immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Using near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence imaging and single photon emission computed tomography imaging technology, it is found that sHDL@Pt can be effectively accumulated in tumor sites. The sHDL@Pt can induce severe DNA damage, which subsequently results in a more pronounced activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. This work introduces a novel approach for delivering Pt(IV) prodrug that effectively initiates and activates innate immunity through the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Photoelectrochemical System for Scalable Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production via Molecularly Engineered Conjugated Polycarbazole Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a molecularly engineered conjugated polycarbazole framework that enables efficient, stable, and bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical synthesis of H2O2. Scaled to a 1 m2 panel reactor operating under natural sunlight, the system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.10%, setting a new benchmark as the largest and most efficient solar&#8208;driven PEC system for H2O2 production demonstrated to date.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) synthesis emerges as a promising pathway to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), reimagining the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. However, scaling PEC systems from laboratory&#8208;scale prototypes to practical large&#8208;area installations remains a significant scientific and engineering challenge, primarily due to limited catalytic selectivity at photoelectrode surfaces and rapid performance degradation during upscaling. This study presents a modular, bias&#8208;free PEC system designed for scalable solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Conjugated polycarbazole frameworks (CPFs) containing rationally designed diacetylene and anthraquinone moieties functions as molecularly precise catalytic layers, enabling concurrent two&#8208;electron pathways at both the photoanode and photocathode. The resulting photoanode and photocathode deliver faradaic efficiencies of 94.08% and 95.50%, respectively, for H2O2 production. Integrating these photoelectrodes into a 1 cm2 unbiased tandem PEC device achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 2.11%. More importantly, scaling these devices to a 1 m2 membrane&#8208;free PEC panel reactor via a modular assembly strategy yields an average SCC efficiency of 1.10% under natural sunlight, representing the largest reported solar&#8208;driven PEC system for H2O2 production to date. This study bridges the gap between laboratory&#8208;scale experimentation and real&#8208;world applications, providing a scalable framework for decentralized, solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production.

         <title>Tandem Organic Solar Cells with 21.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A narrow bandgap acceptor, BTA&#8208;4F, featuring a 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole central core, is fabricated to construct the rear sub&#8208;cell of tandem organic solar cells (OSCs). By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution in the BAT&#8208;4F&#8208;based tandem OSC, a power conversion efficiency of 21.5% is achieved (certified as 21.2%), respectively, which marks the arrival of 21% era in the field of OSCs.2









Abstract
Tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) offer a promising strategy for enhancing light utilization and reducing energy loss, presenting significant potential in achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, a narrow bandgap acceptor, BTA&#8208;4F, featuring a 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole (BTA) central core, is fabricated, which is designed for the rear sub&#8208;cell of tandem OSCs. Systematic characterizations demonstrate that incorporating strong electron donating groups BTA into central core unit can narrow the bandgap and enhance the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency. These improvements lead to increased current density and reduced voltage loss of single junction OSCs under AM 1.5G illumination and real incident light of the rear sub&#8208;cell. Inspiringly, BTA&#8208;4F&#8208;based single&#8208;junction and tandem OSCs achieve outstanding PCEs of 19.5% and 21.5% (Certified as 21.2%), respectively, which represents the milestone of 21% PCE in the field of OSCs. This study highlights the synergistic benefits of molecular design and implementation of tandem architecture as an effective strategy for enhancing photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Structural Tuning Magnetism and Topology in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systematic study of magnetic topological matter under hydrostatic pressure reveals strong material response to pressure, demonstrating a shrinking topological gap and enhanced magnetic order under compression. These findings establish strain engineering as an effective tuning parameter for manipulating and potentially enhancing the quantum anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
To date, the most widely&#8208;studied quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) platform is achieved by dilute doping of magnetic ions into thin films of the alloyed tetradymite topological insulator (TI) (Bi1 &#8722; xSbx)2Te3 (BST). In these films, long&#8208;range magnetic ordering of the transition metal substituants opens an exchange gap &#916; in the topological surface states, stabilizing spin&#8208;polarized, dissipationless edge channels with a nonzero Chern number C$\mathcal {C}$. The long&#8208;range ordering of the spatially separated magnetic ions is itself mediated by electronic states in the host TI, leading to a sophisticated feedback between magnetic and electronic properties. Here, a study is presented on the electronic and magnetic response of a BST&#8208;based QAHI system to structural tuning via hydrostatic pressure. A systematic closure of the topological gap under compressive strain is identified accompanied by a simultaneous enhancement in the magnetic ordering strength. Combining these experimental results with first&#8208;principle calculations, structural deformation is identified as a strong tuning parameter to traverse a rich topological phase space and modify magnetism in the magnetically doped BST&#160;system.

         <title>Recent Advances in Moir&#233; Superlattice Systems by Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial moir&#233; superlattices have become a fertile playground for emergent quantum phenomena. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures and thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. Major advances in the ARPES studies of moir&#233; superlattices are reviewed and new experimental directions are discussed.








Abstract
The last decade has witnessed a flourish in 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as atomic&#8208;scale Legos. Artificial moir&#233; superlattices via stacking 2D materials with a twist angle and/or a lattice mismatch have recently become a fertile playground exhibiting a plethora of emergent properties beyond their building blocks. These rich quantum phenomena stem from their nontrivial electronic structures that are effectively tuned by the moir&#233; periodicity. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures with decent momentum, energy, and spatial resolution, thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. In this review, first, a brief introduction is given on advanced ARPES techniques and basic ideas of band structures in a moir&#233; superlattice system. Then ARPES research results of various moir&#233; superlattice systems are highlighted, including graphene on substrates with small lattice mismatches, twisted graphene/TMD moir&#233; systems, and high&#8208;order moir&#233; superlattice systems. Finally, it discusses important questions that remain open, challenges in current experimental investigations, and presents an outlook on this field of research.

         <title>Emerging Bioprinting for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a series of bioprinting techniques, polymer&#8208;based inks, and bioprinted devices are presented for wound healing. Recent advances in this cutting&#8208;edge field, including seven modification strategies of bioprinted devices and the clinical needs they address are summarized and discussed. Several frontiers of bioprinting, challenges, and future directions are highlighted and prospected.








Abstract
Bioprinting has attracted much attention due to its suitability for fabricating biomedical devices. In particular, bioprinting has become one of the growing centers in the field of wound healing, with various types of bioprinted devices being developed, including 3D scaffolds, microneedle patches, and flexible electronics. Bioprinted devices can be designed with specific biostructures and biofunctions that closely match the shape of wound sites and accelerate the regeneration of skin through various approaches. Herein, a comprehensive review of the bioprinting of smart wound dressings is presented, emphasizing the crucial effect of bioprinting in determining biostructures and biofunctions. The review begins with an overview of bioprinting techniques and bioprinted devices, followed with an in&#8208;depth discussion of polymer&#8208;based inks, modification strategies, additive ingredients, properties, and applications. The strategies for the modification of bioprinted devices are divided into seven categories, including chemical synthesis of novel inks, physical blending, coaxial bioprinting, multimaterial bioprinting, physical absorption, chemical immobilization, and hybridization with living cells, and examples are presented. Thereafter, the frontiers of bioprinting and wound healing, including 4D bioprinting, artificial intelligence&#8208;assisted bioprinting, and in situ bioprinting, are discussed from a perspective of interdisciplinary sciences. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries in Nonalkaline Aqueous Electrolytes: Progress, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn metal batteries in nonalkaline electrolytes can enable higher capacities and energy densities than conventional intercalated cathode materials. This review summarizes the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions of these four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials (MnO2, halogen materials, chalcogenide materials, and Cu&#8208;based compounds), and proposes some suggestions for their developments.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are attractive as safe and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. At present, due to the narrow window of the aqueous electrolyte and the strong reliance of the Zn2+ ion intercalated reaction on the host structure, the current intercalated cathode materials exhibit restricted energy densities. In contrast, cathode materials with conversion reactions can promise higher energy densities. Especially, the recently reported conversion&#8208;type cathode materials that function in nonalkaline electrolytes have garnered increasing attention. This is because the use of nonalkaline electrolytes can prevent the occurrence of side reactions encountered in alkaline electrolytes and thereby enhance cycling stability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions to these cathode materials. In this review, four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials including MnO2, halogen materials (Br2 and I2), chalcogenide materials (O2, S, Se, and Te), and Cu&#8208;based compounds (CuI, Cu2O, Cu2S, CuO, CuS, and CuSe) are reviewed. First, the reaction mechanisms and battery structures of these materials are introduced. Second, the fundamental problems and their corresponding solutions are discussed in detail in each material. Finally, future directions and efforts for the development of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries are proposed.

         <title>2D Ferroic Materials for Nonvolatile Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroic materials with ultrathin thickness and atomically smooth interface are promising candidates for constructing novel memory devices. This review surveys recent progress and proposes future prospects on 2D ferroic materials for nonvolatile memory applications, including 2D spintronic devices, 2D ferroelectric devices, and 2D multiferroic devices.








Abstract
The emerging nonvolatile memory technologies based on ferroic materials are promising for producing high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power, and high&#8208;density memory in the field of&#160;integrated circuits.

         <title>Functional Materials for Subcellular Targeting Strategies in Cancer Therapy: Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates eight targeting strategies of functional materials that specifically target subcellular structures in tumor cells, including mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, Golgiosome, cytomembrane, and multi&#8208;organelle targeting strategies, and covers a wide range of functional materials, such as liposomes, metal nanoparticles, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, dendrimer nanoplatforms, carbon nanotubes, mitochondria&#8208;targeting mesoporous silica nanoparticles, carbon QD, amphiphilic copolymers, and small molecular compounds.








Abstract
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies have made significant progress in cancer treatment. However, tumor adjuvant therapy still faces challenges due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer, genomic instability, and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Functional materials possess unique biological properties such as long circulation times, tumor&#8208;specific targeting, and immunomodulation. The combination of functional materials with natural substances and nanotechnology has led to the development of smart biomaterials with multiple functions, high biocompatibilities, and negligible immunogenicities, which can be used for precise cancer treatment. Recently, subcellular structure&#8208;targeting functional materials have received particular attention in various biomedical applications including the diagnosis, sensing, and imaging of tumors and drug delivery. Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting materials can precisely accumulate therapeutic agents in organelles, considerably reduce the threshold dosages of therapeutic agents, and minimize drug&#8208;related side effects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the research progress in subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy based on functional nanomaterials. Moreover, it explains the challenges and prospects of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting functional materials in precision oncology. The review will serve as an excellent cutting&#8208;edge guide for researchers in the field of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The up&#8208;to&#8208;date growth strategies for the controlled synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconducting TMDCs polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films are systematically summarized. The large&#8208;area accurate doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and its effect on the device performances are discussed. The challenges regarding the improvement of electronic device performances of 2D semiconducting TMDCs are highlighted, and the further research directions are proposed.








Abstract
2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) possess atomically thin thickness, a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, flexible band structure, and silicon&#8208;compatible feature, making them one of the most promising channels for constructing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art field&#8208;effect transistors in the post&#8208;Moore's era. However, the existing 2D semiconducting TMDCs fall short of meeting the industry criteria for practical applications in electronics due to their small domain size and the lack of an effective approach to modulate intrinsic physical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare and dope 2D semiconducting TMDCs single crystals with wafer size. In this review, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress regarding the wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D semiconducting TMDC polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films is systematically summarized. The domain orientation control of 2D TMDCs and the seamless stitching of unidirectionally aligned 2D islands by means of substrate design are proposed. In addition, the accurate and uniform doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and the effect on electronic device performances are also discussed. Finally, the dominating challenges pertaining to the enhancement of the electronic device performances of TMDCs are emphasized, and further development directions are put forward. This review provides a systematic and in&#8208;depth summary of high&#8208;performance device applications of 2D semiconducting TMDCs.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer Noninvasive Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper discusses the photothermal properties and biological mechanisms of nanomaterials, emphasizing a clinical and biological perspective. The primary focus is on current research regarding photothermal nanoparticles for breast cancer treatment: nanoparticle materials, breast characteristics, functional design, and commonly used adjuvant therapy in clinical practice.








Abstract
Rapid advancements in materials science and nanotechnology, intertwined with oncology, have positioned photothermal therapy (PTT) as a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for cancer. The breast's superficial anatomical location and aesthetic significance render breast cancer a particularly pertinent candidate for the clinical application of PTT following melanoma. This review comprehensively explores the research conducted on the various types of nanoparticles employed in PTT for breast cancer and elaborates on their specific roles and mechanisms of action. The integration of PTT with existing clinical therapies for breast cancer is scrutinized, underscoring its potential for synergistic outcomes. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying PTT and consequential modifications to the tumor microenvironment after treatment are elaborated from a medical perspective. Future research directions are suggested, with an emphasis on the development of integrative platforms that combine multiple therapeutic approaches and the optimization of nanoparticle synthesis for enhanced treatment efficacy. The goal is to push the boundaries of PTT toward a comprehensive, clinically applicable treatment for breast cancer.

         <title>Hemoperfusion Adsorbents for Removal of Common Toxins in Liver and Kidney Failure: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver and kidney failure leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxin, and creatinine in the blood and tissues, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins by extracorporeal system. Carbon materials, zeolites, MXenes, polymer materials, composite materials, porous materials, etc. have been developed as hemoperfusion adsorbents to remove common toxins in liver and kidney failure and to treat liver and kidney failure.








Abstract
Liver and kidney failure can lead to extensive accumulation of toxic metabolites in the blood and tissues, such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins from the blood and treat liver and kidney failure. However, the adsorption efficiency and safety of traditional hemoperfusion adsorbents are not ideal. Thus, it is urgent to develop adsorbents with good blood compatibility, as well as high adsorption and strong selective capacities, to fulfill the clinical needs. In recent years, new hemoperfusion adsorbents with improved adsorption performance and good blood compatibility have been developed. This review classifies and summarizes the recent research progress in hemoperfusion adsorbents for common blood toxins (bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea) produced by liver and kidney failure. The composition and structure of various toxin adsorbents, toxin adsorption performance, biocompatibility, blood safety, and the adsorption mechanisms of toxins are discussed. Based on a summary of recent studies, feasible strategies have been explored for designing and preparing hemoperfusion adsorbents to fulfill future development requirements. The trends and clinical application prospects of various toxin adsorbents are also discussed.

Nanoporous crystalline materials exhibit enormous potential as an effective platform for nucleic acid recognition and application. These materials have highly ordered and uniform pore structures, as well as adjustable surface chemistry and pore size, making them good carriers for nucleic acid extraction, detection, and delivery. In this review, the latest developments in nanoporous crystalline materials, including metal organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) for nucleic acid recognition and applications are discussed. Different strategies for functionalizing these materials are explored to specifically identify nucleic acid targets. Their applications in selective separation and detection of nucleic acids are highlighted. They can also be used as DNA/RNA sensors, gene delivery agents, host DNAzymes, and in DNA&#8208;based computing. Other applications include catalysis, data storage, and biomimetics. The development of novel nanoporous crystalline materials with enhanced biocompatibility has opened up new avenues in the fields of nucleic acid analysis and therapy, paving the way for the development of sensitive, selective, and cost&#8208;effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools with widespread applications.

         <title>Machine Learning Paves the Way for High Entropy Compounds Exploration: Challenges, Progress, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) revolutionizes high entropy compounds (HECs) research, addressing their complex structures. It models HEC at atomic and macroscopic levels, using various algorithms. Accurate data, feature engineering, and cross&#8208;validation are key for robust models. ML's potential in HEC exploration is significant, driving Artificial&#8208;intelliegence&#8208;assisted material discovery.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the research field of high entropy compounds (HECs), which have gained worldwide attention due to their vast compositional space and abundant regulatability. However, the complex structure space of HEC poses challenges to traditional experimental and computational approaches, necessitating the adoption of machine learning. Microscopically, machine learning can model the Hamiltonian of the HEC system, enabling atomic&#8208;level property investigations, while macroscopically, it can analyze macroscopic material characteristics such as hardness, melting point, and ductility. Various machine learning algorithms, both traditional methods and deep neural networks, can be employed in HEC research. Comprehensive and accurate data collection, feature engineering, and model training and selection through cross&#8208;validation are crucial for establishing excellent ML models. ML also holds promise in analyzing phase structures and stability, constructing potentials in simulations, and facilitating the design of functional materials. Although some domains, such as magnetic and device materials, still require further exploration, machine learning's potential in HEC research is substantial. Consequently, machine learning has become an indispensable tool in understanding and exploiting the capabilities of HEC, serving as the foundation for the new paradigm of Artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;assisted material exploration.

         <title>Rational Designs of Biomaterials for Combating Oral Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intractable oral biofilms are the chief culprits of both dental infections and systemic inflammation, posing a great threat to human health. In this review, core strategies of recently developed biomaterials in eradicating oral biofilm are present. Furthermore, design rationales of biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity, as well as versatile antibiofilm biomaterials with other functions are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Oral biofilms, which are also known as dental plaque, are the culprit of a wide range of oral diseases and systemic diseases, thus contributing to serious health risks. The manner of how to achieve good control of oral biofilms has been an increasing public concern. Novel antimicrobial biomaterials with highly controllable fabrication and functionalization have been proven to be promising candidates. However, previous reviews have generally emphasized the physicochemical properties, action mode, and application effectiveness of those biomaterials, whereas insufficient attention has been given to the design rationales tailored to different infection types and application scenarios. To offer guidance for better diversification and functionalization of anti&#8208;oral&#8208;biofilm biomaterials, this review details the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design rationales in three aspects: the core strategies in combating oral biofilm, as well as the biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity and multiple functions based on the improvement or combination of the abovementioned antimicrobial strategies. Thereafter, insights on the existing challenges and future improvement of biomaterial&#8208;assisted oral biofilm treatments are proposed, hoping to provide a theoretical basis and reference for the subsequent design and application of antibiofilm biomaterials.

         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent advances on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for precision diagnosis and treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are comprehensively summarized. The chemical compositions of LNPs and the modification strategies for enhanced tumor target are introduced.

Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological malignancy and represents a leading threat to healthcare. Recent years have seen a series of progresses in the early diagnosis and management of RCC. Theranostic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are increasingly becoming one of the focuses in this field, because of their suitability for tumor targeting and multimodal therapy. LNPs can be precisely fabricated with desirable chemical compositions and biomedical properties, which closely match the physiological characteristics and clinical needs of RCC. Herein, a comprehensive review of theranostic LNPs is presented, emphasizing the generic tool nature of LNPs in developing advanced micro&#8208;nano biomaterials. It begins with a brief overview of the compositions and formation mechanism of LNPs, followed with an introduction to kidney&#8208;targeting approaches, such as passive, active, and stimulus responsive targeting. With examples provided, a series of modification strategies for enhancing the tumor targeting and functionality of LNPs are discussed. Thereafter, research advances on applications of these LNPs for RCC including bioimaging, liquid biopsy, drug delivery, physical therapy, and gene therapy are summarized and discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective. The final part highlights the milestone achievements of translation medicine, current challenges as well as future development directions of LNPs for the diagnosis and treatment of RCC.

         <title>Geometric Control and Optical Properties of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have provided great opportunities for many promising applications. Here, the geometric control and optical properties of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are circumnavigated and widen the scope of their potential applications. It is envisioned that these studies will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for emerging applications.








Abstract
Intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit intriguing geometry&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties, which is due to the combination of plasmonic features with geometric chirality. Thus, chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have become promising candidates for applications in biosensing, asymmetric catalysis, biomedicine, photonics, etc. Recent advances in geometric control and optical tuning of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have further opened up a unique opportunity for their widespread applications in many emerging technological areas. Here, the recent developments in the geometric control of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are reviewed with special attention given to the quantitative understanding of the chiroptical structure&#8208;property relationship. Several important optical spectroscopic tools for characterizing the optical chirality of plasmonic nanomaterials at both ensemble and single&#8208;particle levels are also discussed. Three emerging applications of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials, including enantioselective sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and biomedicine, are further highlighted. It is envisioned that these advanced studies in chiral plasmonic nanomaterials will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for diverse emerging technological applications.

         <title>The Key Role of Molecular Packing in Luminescence Property: From Adjacent Molecules to Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly discusses the molecular aggregation science behind luminescence materials. From the basic packing modes of adjacent molecules to the various aggregated structures, the efficient bridge between molecular structures and luminescence property has been roughly built to promote their development from internal to external.








Abstract
The luminescence materials act as the key components in many functional devices, as well as the detection and imaging systems, which can be permeated in each aspect of modern life, and attract more and more attention for the creative technology and applications. In addition to the diverse properties of organic luminogens, the multiple molecular packing at aggregated states frequently offers new and/or exciting performance. However, there still lacks comprehensive analysis of molecular packing in these organic materials, resulting in an increased gap between molecular design and practical applications. In this review, from the basic knowledge of organic compounds as single molecules, to the discernable property of excimer, charge transfer (CT) complex or self&#8208;assembly systems by adjacent molecules, and finally to the opto&#8208;electronic performance of molecular aggregates, the relevant factors to molecular packing and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Lightning the Spin: Harnessing the Potential of 2D Magnets in Opto&#8208;Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D magnets provide diverse magnetic orders for spins to be aligned, including intralayer ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and interlayer (A&#8208;type) antiferromagnetism, which allow the spins to precess in a wide range of frequency from GHz to X&#8208;ray. By interacting with the given wavelength of light/electromagnetic wave, the spins can be excited (written) and detected (read), realizing different types of opto&#8208;spintronic devices and functions.








Abstract
Since the emergence of 2D magnets in 2017, the diversity of these materials has greatly expanded. Their 2D nature (atomic&#8208;scale thickness) endows these magnets with strong magnetic anisotropy, layer&#8208;dependent and switchable magnetic order, and quantum&#8208;confined quasiparticles, which distinguish them from conventional 3D magnetic materials. Moreover, the 2D geometry facilitates light incidence for opto&#8208;spintronic applications and potential on&#8208;chip integration. In analogy to optoelectronics based on optical&#8211;electronic interactions, opto&#8208;spintronics use light&#8208;spin interactions to process spin information stored in the solid state. In this review, opto&#8208;spintronics is divided into three types with respect to the wavelengths of radiation interacting with 2D magnets: 1) GHz (microwave) to THz (mid&#8208;infrared), 2) visible, and 3) UV to X&#8208;rays. It is focused on the recent research advancements on the newly discovered mechanisms of light&#8208;spin interactions in 2D magnets and introduces the potential design of novel opto&#8208;spintronic applications based on these interactions.

         <title>A Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayer high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co&#8208;ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high&#8208;entropy material structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in 1&#160;m KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high&#8208;entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;A monolayer high-entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co-ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high-entropy material structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high-entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high-entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Preventing Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias Via Local Hyperthermia Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of AIEgen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks are constructed with a unique &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; functionality, which is not only efficient in directly modulating the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy, but also further inducing browning of white fat and ameliorating the neuroinflammation of peri&#8208;SG, favorable for inhibiting malignant ventricular arrhythmias.








Abstract
The engineering of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs), TDTA&#8208;COF, BTDTA&#8208;COF, and BTDBETA&#8208;COF are reported, as hyperthermia agents for inhibiting the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). These AIE COFs exhibit dual functionality, as they not only directly modulate the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy (LHT) but also induce the browning of white fat and improve the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment, which is favorable for inhibiting ischemia&#8208;induced VAs. In vivo studies have confirmed that BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT enhances thermogenesis and browning&#8208;related gene expression, thereby serving a synergistic role in combating VAs. Transcriptome analysis of peri&#8208;SG adipose tissue reveals a substantial downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potency of BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT in ameliorating the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment and offering myocardial and arrhythmia protection. The work on AIE COF&#8208;based hyperthermia agent for VAs inhibition provides a new avenue for mitigating cardiac sympathetic nerve hyperactivity.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Regulating Drug Delivery Nanoparticles for Treating and Preventing Typical Biofilm&#8208;Induced Oral Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most of the infectious diseases in the oral cavity are based on disturbances in the bacterial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. In this work, a microenvironment&#8208;targeted drug delivery nanoparticle is prepared to inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, modulate macrophage polarization, and produce photodynamic and photothermal effects. It performs antibacterial, anti&#8208;biofilm, and anti&#8208;inflammation effects to achieve the treatment and prevention for typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases.








Abstract
The oral cavity comprises an environment full of microorganisms. Dysregulation of this microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment will lead to a series of oral diseases, such as implant&#8208;associated infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilms and periodontitis initiated by Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis). In this study, a liposome&#8208;encapsulated indocyanine green (ICG) and rapamycin drug&#8208;delivery nanoparticle (ICG&#8208;rapamycin) is designed to treat and prevent two typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. ICG&#8208;rapamycin elevates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and temperature levels to facilitate photodynamic and photothermal mechanisms under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation for anti&#8208;bacteria. In addition, it prevents biofilm formation by promoting bacterial motility with increasing the ATP levels. The nanoparticles modulate the microbial&#8208;cellular interaction to reduce cellular inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance, which includes promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages, upregulating the anti&#8208;inflammatory factor TGF&#8208;&#946;, and enhancing the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages. Based on these findings, ICG&#8208;rapamycin is applied to implant&#8208;infected and periodontitis animal models to confirm the effects in vivo. This study demonstrates that ICG&#8208;rapamycin can treat and prevent biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment, thus providing a promising strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow&#8208;Structured Mesoporous Carbons by Enhanced Surface Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons with ultrahigh surface area, large pore volume and heteroatom doping are synthesized by a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method. The materials display remarkable electrochemical performance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The studies reveal that strong interactions between the organic molecules and the silanol&#8208;rich surface of the silica template are crucial.








Abstract
Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK&#8208;5&#8208;like structures that are constructed to consist of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of the template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method to create hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom&#8208;doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2&#8208;thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates is reported. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), large pore volume (4.0&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory lithium&#8208;storage capacity (1460&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (320&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Single&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanomachining for Fabrication of a Uniform Nanochannel Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retention of individual gold nanoparticles on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining, is enabled via a simple and versatile strategy. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single micrometer&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing.








Abstract
The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing.

&lt;p&gt;The retention of individual gold nanoparticles on a substrate, enabling single-nanoparticle nanomachining, is enabled via a simple and versatile strategy. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron-beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single micrometer-long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape-based nanoparticle distinguishing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal-nanoparticle-assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single-nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron-beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter-long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape-based nanoparticle distinguishing. The developed method can also facilitate single-nanoparticle studies and nanomachining for a broad application in materials science, electronics, micro/nano-optics, and catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Lanthanum Oxychloride Dielectric for 2D Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) LaOCl is synthesized by controlling the growth kinetics. Due to the considerable dielectric properties of LaOCl and its dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, the MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with vdW LaOCl dielectric exhibits ultralow hysteresis. LaOCl possesses the tremendous potential to act as an ideal gate dielectric for two&#8208;dimensional FETs.








Abstract
Downsizing silicon&#8208;based transistors can result in lower power consumption, faster speeds, and greater computational capacity, although it is accompanied by the appearance of short&#8208;channel effects. The integration of high&#8208;mobility 2D semiconductor channels with ultrathin high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;) dielectric in transistors is expected to suppress the effect. Nevertheless, the absence of a high&#8208;&#954; dielectric layer featuring an atomically smooth surface devoid of dangling bonds poses a significant obstacle in the advancement of 2D electronics. Here, ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) dielectrics are successfully synthesized by precisely controlling the growth kinetics. These dielectrics demonstrate an impressive high&#8208;&#954; value of 10.8 and exhibit a remarkable breakdown field strength (Ebd) exceeding 10 MV cm&#8722;1. Remarkably, the conventional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) featuring a dielectric made of LaOCl showcases an almost negligible hysteresis when compared to FETs employing alternative gate dielectrics. This can be attributed to the flawlessly formed vdW interface and excellent compatibility established between LaOCl and MoS2. These findings will motivate the further exploration of rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides and the development of more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore nanoelectronic devices.

Properties of LM and its application in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains a leading cause of high mortality and imposes a significant health burden globally. The biocompatibility between materials and the cardiovascular system, encompassing biological safety, modulus matching, and anti&#8208;fatigue performance in dynamic physiological environments, has been a critical challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs. The emergence of liquid metal (LM) offers promising opportunities to develop diagnostic and therapeutic methods that exhibit excellent biocompatibility with the cardiovascular system. In this perspective, the progress of LM applications in contrast agents, nanomedicine, implantable and wearable bioelectronic devices, and bionic materials is evaluated, providing a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth discussion of the role and advantages of LM in CVDs management. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of LM in the field of CVDs diagnosis and treatment are outlined.

         <title>Routes to Electrochemically Stable Sulfur Cathodes for Practical Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state reaction&#8221; mechanism can enable the redox reaction of sulfur to proceed in a solid&#8208;phase conversion manner in liquid electrolytes without the generation and dissolution of polysulfide intermediates at cycling, and therefore is a promising approach to develop high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable sulfur cathodes for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been investigated intensively as a post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion technology in the past decade; however, their realizable energy density and cycling performance are still far from satisfaction for commercial development. Although many extremely high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable S cathodes and Li anodes are reported in literature, their use for practical Li&#8211;S batteries remains challenging due to the huge gap between the laboratory research and industrial applications. The laboratory research is usually conducted by use of a thin&#8208;film electrode with a low sulfur loading and high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios, while the practical batteries require a thick/high sulfur loading cathode and a low E/S ratio to achieve a desired energy density. To make this clear, the inherent problems of dissolution/deposition mechanism of conventional sulfur cathodes are analyzed from the viewpoint of polarization theory of porous electrode after a brief overview of the recent research progress on sulfur cathodes of Li&#8211;S batteries, and the possible strategies for building an electrochemically stable sulfur cathode are discussed for practically viable Li&#8211;S batteries from the authors&#8217; own understandings.

An overview of interface engineering strategies to overcome the limitation of the Debye screening effect for the achievement of high&#8208;performance FET&#8208;based electronic devices is proposed, and their applications in biological environment analysis are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Promising advances in molecular medicine have promoted the urgent requirement for reliable and sensitive diagnostic tools. Electronic biosensing devices based on field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) exhibit a wide range of benefits, including rapid and label&#8208;free detection, high sensitivity, easy operation, and capability of integration, possessing significant potential for application in disease screening and health monitoring. In this perspective, the tremendous efforts and achievements in the development of high&#8208;performance FET biosensors in the past decade are summarized, with emphasis on the interface engineering of FET&#8208;based electrical platforms for biomolecule identification. First, an overview of engineering strategies for interface modulation and recognition element design is discussed in detail. For a further step, the applications of FET&#8208;based electrical devices for in vitro detection and real&#8208;time monitoring in biological systems are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, the key opportunities and challenges of FET&#8208;based electronic devices in biosensing are discussed. It is anticipated that a comprehensive understanding of interface engineering strategies in FET biosensors will inspire additional techniques for developing highly sensitive, specific, and stable FET biosensors as well as emerging designs for next&#8208;generation biosensing electronics.

The most critical challenge for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), one of the primary hydrogen energy technologies, is to achieve decent output performance with low usage of platinum (Pt). Currently, the performance of PEMFCs is largely limited by two issues at the catalyst/ionomer interface, specifically, the poisoning of active sites of Pt by sulfonate groups and the extremely sluggish local oxygen transport toward Pt. In the past few years, emerging strategies are derived to tackle these interface problems through materials optimization and innovation. This perspective summarizes the latest advances in this regard, and in the meantime unveils the molecule&#8208;level mechanisms behind the materials modulation of interfacial structures. This paper starts with a brief introduction of processes and structures of catalyst/ionomer interfaces, which is followed by a detailed review of progresses in key materials toward interface optimization, including catalysts, ionomers, and additives, with particular emphasis on the role of materials structure in regulating the intermolecular interactions. Finally, the challenges for the application of the established materials and research directions to broaden the material library are highlighted.

         <title>Processability Considerations for Next&#8208;Generation Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive set of key performance indicators is proposed to address the limitations of current evaluation methods for the processability of organic photovoltaic materials, aiming to guide academic research and enhance industrial processability.








Abstract
The evolution of organic semiconductors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has resulted in unforeseen outcomes. This has provided substitute choices of photoactive layer materials, which effectively convert sunlight into electricity. Recently developed OPV materials have narrowed down the gaps in efficiency, stability, and cost in devices. Records now show power conversion efficiency in single&#8208;junction devices closing to 20%. Despite this, there is still a gap between the currently developed OPV materials and those that meet the requirements of practical applications, especially the solution processability issue widely concerned in the field of OPVs. Based on the general rule that structure determines properties, methodologies to enhance the processability of OPV materials are reviewed and explored from the perspective of material design and views&#160;on the further development of processable OPV materials are presented. Considering the current dilemma that the existing evaluation indicators cannot reflect the industrial processability of OPV materials, a more complete set of key performance indicators are proposed&#160;for their processability considerations. The purpose of this perspective is to raise awareness of the boundary conditions that exist in industrial OPV manufacturing and to provide guidance for academic research that aspires to contribute to technological advancements.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Topological Phononic Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research of non&#8208;Hermitian physics is in the ascendant and has brought new opportunities for the development of topological metamaterials. This perspective reviews the recent advances in non&#8208;Hermitian topological phononic metamaterials for acoustic wave and mechanical structures. New configurations and mechanisms for skin effect in high&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;Hermitian systems and non&#8208;Hermitian effect for elastic wave metamaterials are worthy of further exploration.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian (NH) physics describes novel phenomena in open systems that allow generally complex spectra. Introducing NH physics into topological metamaterials, which permits explorations of topological wave phenomena in artificially designed structures, not only enables the experimental verification of exotic NH phenomena in these flexible platforms, but also enriches the manipulation of wave propagation beyond the Hermitian cases. Here, a perspective on the advances in the research of NH topological phononic metamaterials is presented, which covers the exceptional points and their topological geometries, the skin effect related to the topology of complex spectra, the interplay of NH effects and topological states in phononic metamaterials, etc.

         <title>In Situ Twistronics: A New Platform Based on Superlubricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The burgeoning field of twistronics has been ignited by the straightforward manipulation of interlayer twist between van der Waals layered materials. This perspective highlights the in situ twisting techniques and the underlying superlubricity mechanism, and exemplifies new promising opportunities arising from the intersection of the fields of twistronics, nanotribology, and micro/nano&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), etc.








Abstract
Twistronics, an emerging field focused on exploring the unique electrical properties induced by twist interface in graphene multilayers, has garnered significant attention in recent years. The general manipulation of twist angle depends on the assembly of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, which has led to the discovery of unconventional superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and nonlinear optics, thereby expanding the realm of twistronics. Recently, in situ tuning of interlayer conductivity in vdW layered materials has been achieved based on scanning probe microscope. In this Perspective, the advancements in in situ twistronics are focused on by reviewing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ manipulating technology, discussing the underlying mechanism based on the concept of structural superlubricity, and exploiting the real&#8208;time twistronic tests under scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is shown that the real&#8208;time manipulation under SEM allows for visualizing and monitoring the interface status during in situ twistronic testing. By harnessing the unique tribological properties of vdW layered materials, this novel platform not only enhances the fabrication of twistronic devices but also facilitates the fundamental understanding of interface phenomena in vdW layered materials. Moreover, this platform holds great promise for the application of twistronic&#8208;mechanical systems, providing avenues for the integration of twistronics into various mechanical frameworks.
