      <title>Nanopore&#8208;Supported Metal Nanocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Generation from Liquid&#8208;Phase Chemical Hydrogen Storage Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent research progress on nanopore&#8208;supported metal nanocatalysts for H2 generation from various liquid&#8208;phase chemical hydrogen storage materials is reviewed, mainly focusing on the presentation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic strategies and advanced characterizations of these nanocatalysts and their catalytic performances in hydrogen generation. Some drawbacks of each hydrogen storage system and challenges and opportunities in future research are also highlighted.








Abstract
Hydrogen has emerged as an environmentally attractive fuel and a promising energy carrier for future applications to meet the ever&#8208;increasing energy challenges. The safe and efficient storage and release of hydrogen remain a bottleneck for realizing the upcoming hydrogen economy. Hydrogen storage based on liquid&#8208;phase chemical hydrogen storage materials is one of the most promising hydrogen storage techniques, which offers considerable potential for large&#8208;scale practical applications for its excellent safety, great convenience, and high efficiency. Recently, nanopore&#8208;supported metal nanocatalysts have stood out remarkably in boosting the field of liquid&#8208;phase chemical hydrogen storage. Herein, the latest research progress in catalytic hydrogen production is summarized, from liquid&#8208;phase chemical hydrogen storage materials, such as formic acid, ammonia borane, hydrous hydrazine, and sodium borohydride, by using metal nanocatalysts confined within diverse nanoporous materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous carbons, zeolites, mesoporous silica, and porous organic polymers. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic strategies and advanced characterizations for these nanocatalysts, as well as their catalytic performances in hydrogen generation, are presented. The limitation of each hydrogen storage system and future challenges and opportunities on this subject are also discussed. References in related fields are provided, and more developments and applications to achieve hydrogen energy will be inspired.

      <title>Electroactive Covalent Organic Frameworks: Design, Synthesis, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The design of electroactive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is addressed. Their performance as capacitors, batteries, conductors, fuel&#8208;cells, and electrocatalysts is compared with other porous materials. Perspectives for electroactive COFs in these new advanced applications are provided.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of crystalline porous polymers with tailorable compositions, porosities, functionalities, and intrinsic chemical stability. The incorporation of electroactive moieties in the structure transforms COFs into electroactive materials with great potential for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, the recent advances in the design and use of electroactive COFs as capacitors, batteries, conductors, fuel cells, water&#8208;splitting, and electrocatalysis are addressed. Their remarkable performance is discussed and compared with other porous materials; hence, perspectives in the development of electroactive COFs are presented.

      <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoparticles for Biophotonics</title>
      <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles are emerging as a new class of optical probes for biological applications. A set of strategies to overcome the fundamental limits for enhanced luminescence brightness are presented, and their cutting&#8208;edge biophotonic applications ranging from high spatiotemporal optical imaging to highly sensitive in vivo biosensing, and to light mediated synergistic therapy are highlighted.








Abstract
Light in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is increasingly utilized in bioapplications, providing deeper penetration in biological tissues owing to the lower absorption and scattering in comparison with light in the visible range. Lanthanide&#8208;doped luminescent nanoparticles with excitation and/or emission in the NIR range have recently attracted tremendous attention as one of the prime candidates for noninvasive biological applications due to their unique optical properties, such as large Stokes shift, spectrally sharp luminescence emissions, long luminescence lifetimes, and excellent photostability. Herein, recent advances of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles with NIR upconversion or downshifting luminescence and their uses in cutting&#8208;edge biophotonic applications are presented. A set of efficient strategies for overcoming the fundamental limit of low luminescence brightness of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles is introduced. An in&#8208;depth literature review of their state&#8208;of&#8208;art biophotonics applications is also included, showing their superiority for high&#8208;resolution imaging, single&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;level detection, and efficacy for tissue&#8208;penetrating diagnostics and therapeutics.

      <title>An In&#8208;Depth Study of Zn Metal Surface Chemistry for Advanced Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on the sulfur phase diagram, a dense and robust artificial layer of ZnS is introduced on a Zn metal surface via an in situ vapor&#8211;solid strategy. This ZnS protective layer not only suppresses side reactions by blocking water from the Zn electrode surface, but also inhibits Zn dendrite growth by guiding homogenous Zn plating/stripping.








Abstract
Although Zn metal has been regarded as the most promising anode for aqueous batteries, it persistently suffers from serious side reactions and dendrite growth in mild electrolyte. Spontaneous Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution damage the shelf life and calendar life of Zn&#8208;based batteries, severely affecting their industrial applications. Herein, a robust and homogeneous ZnS interphase is built in situ on the Zn surface by a vapor&#8211;solid strategy to enhance Zn reversibility. The thickness of the ZnS film is controlled via the treatment temperature, and the performance of the protected Zn electrode is optimized. The dense ZnS artificial layer obtained at 350 &#176;C not only suppresses Zn corrosion by forming a physical barrier on the Zn surface, but also inhibits dendrite growth via guiding the Zn plating/stripping underneath the artificial layer. Accordingly, a side reaction&#8208;free and dendrite&#8208;free Zn electrode is developed, the effectiveness of which is also convincing in a MnO2/ZnS@Zn full&#8208;cell with 87.6% capacity retention after 2500 cycles.

      <title>Selective Permeation of Water through Angstrom&#8208;Channel Graphene Membranes for Bioethanol Concentration</title>
      <dc:description>
Graphene membranes with sub&#8208;nanometer channels enable selective permeation of water. This allows for the low&#8208;energy concentration of ethanol with excellent separation performance.








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based laminate membranes have been theoretically predicted to selectively transport ethanol from ethanol&#8211;water solution while blocking water. Here, robust angstrom&#8208;channel graphene membranes (ACGMs) fabricated by intercalating carbon sheets derived from chitosan into thermally reduced graphene oxide (GO) sheets are reported. ACGMs with robust and continuous slit&#8208;shaped pores (an average pore size of 3.9 &#197;) are investigated for the dehydration of ethanol. Surprisingly, only water permeates through ACGMs in the presence of aqueous ethanol solution. For the water&#8208;ethanol mixture containing 90&#160;wt% ethanol, water can selectively permeate through ACGMs with a water flux of 63.8&#160;&#177;&#160;3.2&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C and 389.1&#160;&#177;&#160;19.4&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C, which are over two orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional pervaporation membranes. This means that ACGMs can effectively operate at room temperature. Moreover, the ethanol can be fast concentrated to high purity (up to 99.9&#160;wt%). Therefore, ACGMs are very promising for production of bioethanol with high efficiency, thus improving its process sustainability.

      <title>Catalytic Nanoframes and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
The general synthetic strategies for nanoframes and their application as electrocatalysts for fuel cell and water splitting technologies are described. The standing challenges in application of nanoframe catalysts as well as efforts to overcome them are also introduced, along with suggestions for the future direction of nanoframe&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing need for the production and expenditure of sustainable energy is a result of the astonishing rate of consumption of fossil fuels and the accompanying environmental problems. Emphasis is being directed to the generation of sustainable energy by the fuel cell and water splitting technologies. Accordingly, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts has attracted significant interest, as the fuel cell and water splitting technologies are critically dependent on their performance. Among numerous catalyst designs under investigation, nanoframe catalysts have an intrinsically large surface area per volume and a tunable composition, which impacts the number of catalytically active sites and their intrinsic catalytic activity, respectively. Nevertheless, the structural integrity of the nanoframe during electrochemical operation is an ongoing concern. Some significant advances in the field of nanoframe catalysts have been recently accomplished, specifically geared to resolving the catalytic stability concerns and significantly boosting the intrinsic catalytic activity of the active sites. Herein, general synthetic concepts of nanoframe structures and their structure&#8208;dependent catalytic performance are summarized, along with recent notable advances in this field. A discussion on the remaining challenges and future directions, addressing the limitations of nanoframe catalysts, are also provided.

      <title>Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions: Modulations on the Potential Barrier</title>
      <dc:description>
Ferroelectric tunnel junctions are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memory devices, which exhibit attractive advantages of high&#8208;density of data storage, nondestructive readout, fast write/read access, and low energy consumption. Recent advances in tunneling electroresistance and the emerging physics of ferroelectric tunnel junctions with electronic and ionic modulations on tunneling barrier profiles are discussed and the potential applications are outlined.








Abstract
Recently, ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have attracted considerable attention for potential applications in next&#8208;generation memories, owing to attractive advantages such as high&#8208;density of data storage, nondestructive readout, fast write/read access, and low energy consumption. Herein, recent progress regarding FTJ devices is reviewed with an emphasis on the modulation of the potential barrier. Electronic and ionic approaches that modulate the ferroelectric barriers themselves and/or induce extra barriers in electrodes or at ferroelectric/electrode interfaces are discussed with the enhancement of memory performance. Emerging physics, such as nanoscale ferroelectricity, resonant tunneling, and interfacial metallization, and the applications of FTJs in nonvolatile data storage, neuromorphic synapse emulation, and electromagnetic multistate memory are summarized. Finally, challenges and perspectives of FTJ devices are underlined.

      <title>Chromatic Dispersion Manipulation Based on Metalenses</title>
      <dc:description>
The metalens is one of the most basic and important applications of metasurfaces. The noticeable achievements over the past few years in the field of chromatic dispersion control based on metalenses are highlighted, especially in the development of achromatic metalenses. A perspective on this specific branch of applications and future prospects are also presented.








Abstract
Metasurfaces are 2D metamaterials composed of subwavelength nanoantennas according to specific design. They have been utilized to precisely manipulate various parameters of light fields, such as phase, polarization, amplitude, etc., showing promising functionalities. Among all meta&#8208;devices, the metalens can be considered as the most basic and important application, given its significant advantage in integration and miniaturization compared with traditional lenses. However, the resonant dispersion of each nanoantenna in a metalens and the intrinsic chromatic dispersion of planar devices and optical materials result in a large chromatic aberration in metalenses that severely reduces the quality of their focusing and imaging. Consequently, how to effectively suppress or manipulate the chromatic aberration of metalenses has attracted worldwide attention in the last few years, leading to variety of excellent achievements promoting the development of this field. Herein, recent progress in chromatic dispersion control based on metalenses is reviewed.

In the last decade, fascinating electronic properties have been revealed in this material. These developments are reviewed with regard to two aspects: fundamentals and functions.








Abstract
Iridates have been providing a fertile ground for studying emergent phases of matter that arise from the delicate interplay of various fundamental interactions with approximate energy scale. Among these highly focused quantum materials, the perovskite Sr2IrO4, which belongs to the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper series, stands out and has been intensively addressed in the last decade, since it hosts a novel Jeff = 1/2 state that is a profound manifestation of strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Moreover, the Jeff = 1/2 state represents a rare example of iridates that is better understood both theoretically and experimentally. Here, Sr2IrO4 is taken as an example to review the recent advances of the Jeff = 1/2 state in two aspects: materials fundamentals and functionality potentials. In the fundamentals part, the basic issues for the layered canted antiferromagnetic order of the Jeff = 1/2 magnetic moments in Sr2IrO4 are illustrated, and then the progress of the antiferromagnetic order modulation through diverse routes is highlighted. Subsequently, for the functionality potentials, fascinating properties such as atomic&#8208;scale giant magnetoresistance, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and nonvolatile memory, are addressed. To conclude, prospective remarks and an outlook are given.

Abstract
Silicon and other inorganic semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been extensively investigated in the last two decades for constructing high&#8208;performance nanoelectronics, sensors, and optoelectronics. For many of these applications, these tiny building blocks have to be integrated into the existing planar electronic platform, where precise location, orientation, and layout controls are indispensable. In the advent of More&#8208;than&#8208;Moore's era, there are also emerging demands for a programmable growth engineering of the geometry, composition, and line&#8208;shape of NWs on planar or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane 3D sidewall surfaces. Here, the critical technologies established for synthesis, transferring, and assembly of NWs upon planar surface are examined; then, the recent progress of in&#8208;plane growth of horizontal NWs directly upon crystalline or patterned substrates, constrained by using nanochannels, an epitaxial interface, or amorphous thin film precursors is discussed. Finally, the unique capabilities of planar growth of NWs in achieving precise guided growth control, programmable geometry, composition, and line&#8208;shape engineering are reviewed, followed by their latest device applications in building high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, stretchable electronics, and 3D stacked&#8208;channel integration.

      <title>The Material Efforts for Quantized Hall Devices Based on Topological Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological insulators (TIs) are materials hosting exotic topological quantum effects including the quantum Hall effect and the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The material development history of TIs and magnetic TIs and recent research progress are reviewed, focusing on the realization of these quantized transports, which will promote fundamental research and potential applications in the future.








Abstract
A topological insulator (TI) is a kind of novel material hosting a topological band structure and plenty of exotic topological quantum effects. Achieving quantized electrical transport, including the quantum Hall effect (QHE) and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), is an important aspect of realizing quantum devices based on TI materials. Intense efforts are made in this field, in which the most essential research is based on the optimization of realistic TI materials. Herein, the TI material development process is reviewed, focusing on the realization of quantized transport. Especially, for QHE, the strategies to increase the surface transport ratio and decrease the threshold magnetic field of QHE are examined. For QAHE, the evolution history of magnetic TIs is introduced, and the recently discovered magnetic TI candidates with intrinsic magnetizations are discussed in detail. Moreover, future research perspectives on these novel topological quantum effects are also evaluated.

      <dc:description>
Hybrid nitride&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with integration of quantum dots for high&#8208;performance red/green/blue/white emissions, plasmonic nanolasers operating with ultralow excitation threshold from green to ultraviolet tunable spectral range, and solar&#8208;blind avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with a record&#8208;high gain, are demonstrated. These newest advances in micro/nano&#8208;LEDs, nanolasers, and APDs can shed light on the emerging capabilities of III&#8208;nitride in cutting&#8208;edge applications.








Abstract
In the last two decades, remarkable progress has been achieved in the field of optoelectronic devices based on III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. In terms of photonics applications in the visible&#8211;UV spectral range, III&#8208;nitrides are one of the most promising materials. For instance, emerging gallium nitride (GaN)&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) technology for high&#8208;resolution display, and UV photo&#8208;detection for environmental monitoring, health, and medical applications. In this work, hybrid micro/nano&#8208;LEDs with integration of II&#8211;VI quantum dots by means of lithography and nano&#8208;imprinting patterning techniques are demonstrated, and high&#8208;performance red/green/blue and white emissions are achieved. Consequently, plasmonic nanolasers are designed and fabricated using a metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor structure, where strong surface plasmon polariton coupling leads to the efficient lasing with a low excitation threshold from the visible to UV tunable spectral range. Furthermore, performance&#8208;improved AlGaN UV solar&#8208;blind avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with a separate absorption and multiplication structure by polarization engineering are reported. These APDs deliver a record&#8208;high avalanche gain of up to 1.6 &#215; 105. These newest advances in nano/micro&#8208;LEDs, nanolasers, and APDs can shed light on the emerging capabilities of III&#8208;nitride in cutting&#8208;edge applications.

      <title>Electrode Materials Engineering in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Energy Input and Conversion Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrode materials are considered to be important components for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction systems, as they affect the energy input method and CO2 conversion efficiencies. Various photo&#8208;anode and bio&#8208;anode materials for lowering external bias and progress on cathode catalysts for improving CO2 conversion efficiencies are comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, enhancement strategies in the design of these electrode materials are highlighted.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) is a promising technology to simultaneously alleviate CO2&#8208;caused climate hazards and ever&#8208;increasing energy demands, as it can utilize CO2 in the atmosphere to provide the required feedstocks for industrial production and daily life. In recent years, substantial progress in ECR systems has been achieved by the exploitation of various novel electrode materials. The anodic materials and cathodic catalysts that have, respectively, led to high&#8208;efficiency energy input and effective heterogenous catalytic conversion in ECR systems are comprehensively reviewed. Based on the differences in the nature of energy sources and the role of materials used at the anode, the fundamentals of ECR systems, including photo&#8208;anode&#8208;assisted ECR systems and bio&#8208;anode&#8208;assisted ECR systems, are explained in detail. Additionally, the cathodic reaction mechanisms and pathways of ECR are described along with a discussion of different design strategies for cathode catalysts to enhance conversion efficiency and selectivity. The emerging challenges and some perspective on both anode materials and cathodic catalysts are also outlined for better development of ECR systems.

      <title>Photonic Metamaterial Absorbers: Morphology Engineering and Interdisciplinary Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Photonic metamaterial absorbers (PMAs) are reviewed, focusing on their morphology engineering and interdisciplinary applications. Feasible methods to tailor the subwavelength&#8208;scale structures of PMAs for optimizing their absorption performances are presented. Incorporated with interdisciplinary techniques, the application of PMAs in coloration, sensing, steam generation, and photodetection is also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in nanofabrication technologies have spurred many breakthroughs in the field of photonic metamaterials that provide efficient ways of manipulating light&#8211;matter interaction at subwavelength scales. As one of the most important applications, photonic metamaterials can be used to implement novel optical absorbers. First the morphology engineering of various photonic metamaterial absorbers is discussed, which is highly associated with impendence matching conditions and resonance modes of the absorbers, thus directly determines their absorption efficiency, operational bandwidth, incident angle, and polarization dependence. Then, the recent achievements of various interdisciplinary applications based on photonic metamaterial absorbers, including structural color generation, ultrasensitive optical sensing, solar steam generation, and highly responsive photodetection, are reviewed. This report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development of photonic metamaterial absorbers and their applications in novel nanophotonic systems.

      <title>Electrodeposition Technologies for Li&#8208;Based Batteries: New Frontiers of Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrodeposition induces material syntheses on conductive surfaces and demonstrates the advantages of controlling material thickness, engineering interfaces, and realizing a conformal coating. These features may enable electrodeposition to meet some needs for battery fabrication that conventional technologies can rarely achieve. The latest progress in electrodeposition technologies for Li&#8208;based batteries is summarized.








Abstract
Electrodeposition induces material syntheses on conductive surfaces, distinguishing it from the widely used solid&#8208;state technologies in Li&#8208;based batteries. Electrodeposition drives uphill reactions by applying electric energy instead of heating. These features may enable electrodeposition to meet some needs for battery fabrication that conventional technologies can rarely achieve. The latest progress of electrodeposition technologies in Li&#8208;based batteries is summarized. Each component of Li&#8208;based batteries can be electrodeposited or synthesized with multiple methods. The advantages of electrodeposition are the main focus, and they are discussed in comparison with traditional technologies with the expectation to inspire innovations to build better Li&#8208;based batteries. Electrodeposition coats conformal films on surfaces and can control the film thickness, providing an effective approach to enhancing battery performance. Engineering interfaces by electrodeposition can stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and strengthen the adhesion of active materials to substrates, thereby prolonging the battery longevity. Lastly, a perspective of future studies on electrodepositing batteries is provided. The significant merits of electrodeposition should greatly advance the development of Li&#8208;based batteries.

      <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Nanocages: A New Platform for Advanced Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based nanocages have emerged as a new platform for advanced energy storage and conversion owing to their hollow interior cavity with microchannels across the shells, their high specific surface area with defective outer surface, and their tunable electronic structure. Up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on the synthesis, encapsulating/supporting of carbon&#8208;based nanocages and their applications is presented, along with the research challenges and trends.








Abstract
Energy storage and conversion play a crucial role in modern energy systems, and the exploration of advanced electrode materials is vital but challenging. Carbon&#8208;based nanocages consisting of sp2 carbon shells feature a hollow interior cavity with sub&#8208;nanometer microchannels across the shells, high specific surface area with a defective outer surface, and tunable electronic structure, much different from the intensively studied nanocarbons such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. These structural and morphological characteristics make carbon&#8208;based nanocages a new platform for advanced energy storage and conversion. Up&#8208;to&#8208;date synthetic strategies of carbon&#8208;based nanocages, the utilization of their unique porous structure and morphology for the construction of composites with foreign active species, and their significant applications to the advanced energy storage and conversion are reviewed. Structure&#8211;performance correlations are discussed in depth to highlight the contribution of carbon&#8208;based nanocages. The research challenges and trends are also envisaged for deepening and extending the study and application of this multifunctional material.

Abstract
The exploration of quantum&#8208;inspired symmetries in optical and photonic systems has witnessed immense research interest both fundamentally and technologically in a wide range of subject areas in physics and engineering. One of the principal emerging fields in this context is non&#8208;Hermitian physics based on parity&#8208;time symmetry, originally proposed in the studies pertaining to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory and recently ramified into a diverse set of areas, particularly in optics and photonics. The intriguing physical effects enabled by non&#8208;Hermitian physics and PT symmetry have enhanced significant application prospects and engineering of novel materials. In addition, there has been increasing research interest in many emerging directions beyond optics and photonics. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art developments in the field of complex non&#8208;Hermitian physics based on PT symmetry in various physical settings are brought together, and key concepts, a background, and a detailed perspective on new emerging directions are described. It can be anticipated that this trendy field of interest will be indispensable in providing new perspectives in maneuvering the flow of light in the diverse physical platforms in optics, photonics, condensed matter, optoelectronics, and beyond, and will offer distinctive application prospects in novel functional materials.

Abstract
Engineered nanomaterials have been extensively employed as therapeutics for tumor management. Meanwhile, the complex tumor niche along with multiple barriers at the cellular level collectively hinders the action of nanomedicines. Here, the advanced strategies that hold promise for overcoming the numerous biological barriers facing nanomedicines are summarized. Starting from tumor entry, methods that promote tissue penetration of nanomedicine and address the hypoxia issue are also highlighted. Then, emphasis is given to the significance of overcoming both physical barriers, such as membrane&#8208;associated efflux pumps, and biological features, such as resistance to apoptosis. The pros and cons for an individual approach are presented. In addition, the associated technical problems are discussed, along with the importance of balancing the therapeutic merits and the additional cost of sophisticated nanomedicine designs.

      <title>Constructing Metastructures with Broadband Electromagnetic Functionality</title>
      <dc:description>
Broadband electromagnetic response is often required in the applications of metastructures. It is therefore important to reassess the principles of constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and some trade&#8208;off approaches are reviewed. Perspectives are given on the development of broadband metastructured materials.








Abstract
Electromagnetic metastructures stand for the artificial structures with a characteristic size smaller than the wavelength, which may efficiently manipulate the states of light. However, their applications are often restricted by the bandwidth of the electromagnetic response of the metastructures. It is therefore essential to reassert the principles in constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Herein, after summarizing the conventional approaches for achieving broadband electromagnetic functionality, some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and several trade&#8208;off approaches are reviewed, followed by some perspectives for the future development of broadband metamaterials. It is anticipated that broadband metastructures will have even more substantial applications in optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and information technology.

     alt="Constructing Metastructures with Broadband Electromagnetic Functionality"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadband electromagnetic response is often required in the applications of metastructures. It is therefore important to reassess the principles of constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and some trade&#8208;off approaches are reviewed. Perspectives are given on the development of broadband metastructured materials.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic metastructures stand for the artificial structures with a characteristic size smaller than the wavelength, which may efficiently manipulate the states of light. However, their applications are often restricted by the bandwidth of the electromagnetic response of the metastructures. It is therefore essential to reassert the principles in constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Herein, after summarizing the conventional approaches for achieving broadband electromagnetic functionality, some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and several trade&#8208;off approaches are reviewed, followed by some perspectives for the future development of broadband metamaterials. It is anticipated that broadband metastructures will have even more substantial applications in optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and information technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonlinear Beam Shaping in Domain Engineered Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonlinear holography is a universal technique for nonlinear beam shaping, in which the nonlinear polarization wave acts as the reference beam, while the harmonic wave acts as the object beam. The interference fringe is imprinted onto a nonlinear crystal with modulated domain patterns. This method can be used to engineer the wave front of an arbitrary harmonic wave.








Abstract
Domain engineered ferroelectric crystals are a type of microstructure functional material that is used widely in the area of nonlinear optics. Herein, research processes in the area of nonlinear beam shaping using domain engineered crystals in the past decade are reviewed. The newly developed design methods, such as the nonlinear Huygens&#8211;Fresnel principle, nonlinear volume holography, and caustic design, which have analogs in linear optics, are introduced. Using the proposed methods for nonlinear beam shaping, multiple function integration, generation of Airy beams, and arbitrary curved trajectories are realized. As an extra degree of freedom, orbital angular momentum of light beams is generated and manipulated through domain engineering. Discussions and future directions in this field are presented.

      <title>Tin and Mixed Lead&#8211;Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells: Progress and their Application in Tandem Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress of tin and mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide perovskite solar cells is summarized, including an introduction of device structures, fabrication methods, strategies to improve both performance and stability, and an outlook of pure tin&#8208;based halide, mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide, and monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have recently attracted enormous attention for photovoltaic applications due to their superior optical and electrical properties. Lead (Pb) halide perovskites stand out among this material series, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25%. According to the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (SQ) limit, lead halide perovskites typically exhibit bandgaps that are not within the optimal range for single&#8208;junction solar cells. Partial or complete replacement of lead with tin (Sn) is gaining increasing research interest, due to the promise of further narrowing the bandgaps. This enables ideal solar utilization for single&#8208;junction solar cells as well as the construction of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. In addition, the usage of Sn provides a path to the fabrication of lead&#8208;free or Pb&#8208;reduced perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Recent progress in addressing the challenges of fabricating efficient Sn halide and mixed lead&#8211;tin (Pb&#8211;Sn) halide PSCs is summarized herein. Mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide perovskites hold promise not only for higher efficiency and more stable single&#8208;junction solar cells but also for efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem solar cells.

      <title>Electrochemical and Structural Analysis in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries by Analytical Electron Microscopy: Progress and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with high energy density and safety are attracting tremendous attention. Progress in the characterization of the microstructure and dynamic behavior for batteries using ex situ/in situ transmission electron microscopy is systematically reviewed. Potential opportunities for combining cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and ptychographic phase imaging to alleviate radiation damage and enhance image contrast of light atoms are discussed as a perspective.








Abstract
Advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and its associated instruments have made significant contributions to the characterization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) Li batteries, as these tools provide localized information on the structure, morphology, chemistry, and electronic state of electrodes, electrolytes, and their interfaces at the nano&#8208; and atomic scale. Furthermore, the rapid development of in situ techniques has enabled a deep understanding of interfacial dynamic behavior and heterogeneous characteristics during the cycling process. However, due to the beam&#8208;sensitive nature of light elements in the interphases, e.g., Li and O, thorough and reliable studies of the interfacial structure and chemistry at an ultrahigh spatial resolution without beam damage is still a formidable challenge. Herein, the following points are discussed: (1) the recent contributions of advanced STEM to the study of ASS Li batteries; (2) current challenges associated with using this method; and (3) potential opportunities for combining cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and the STEM phase contrast imaging techniques.

      <title>Self&#8208;Healing Polymers Based on Coordination Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Coordination bonds have been demonstrated to be effective for constructing self&#8208;healing polymers in recent years. The advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self&#8208;healing polymers are discussed, and the various metal&#8211;ligand bonds being utilized in self&#8208;healing polymers along with some examples of functional self&#8208;healing polymers originating from metal&#8211;ligand interactions are summarized. A few concerns and future directions in this research field are proposed.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing ability is an important survival feature in nature, with which living beings can spontaneously repair damage when wounded. Inspired by nature, people have designed and synthesized many self&#8208;healing materials by encapsulating healing agents or incorporating reversible covalent bonds or noncovalent interactions into a polymer matrix. Among the noncovalent interactions, the coordination bond is demonstrated to be effective for constructing highly efficient self&#8208;healing polymers. Moreover, with the presence of functional metal ions or ligands and dynamic metal&#8211;ligand bonds, self&#8208;healing polymers can show various functions such as dielectrics, luminescence, magnetism, catalysis, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and shape&#8208;memory behavior. Herein, the recent developments and achievements made in the field of self&#8208;healing polymers based on coordination bonds are presented. The advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self&#8208;healing polymers are highlighted, the various metal&#8211;ligand bonds being utilized in self&#8208;healing polymers are summarized, and examples of functional self&#8208;healing polymers originating from metal&#8211;ligand interactions are given. Finally, a perspective is included addressing the promises and challenges for the future development of self&#8208;healing polymers based on coordination bonds.

      <title>Graphene Hybrid Structures for Integrated and Flexible Optoelectronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Low light absorption and inefficient carrier extraction are two fundamental limitations in graphene photodetectors. Recent progress in using graphene hybrid structures to enable highly sensitive, broadband, and ultrafast optoelectronic devices, and their potential applications in integrated and flexible electronics are reviewed.








Abstract
Graphene (Gr) has many unique properties including gapless band structure, ultrafast carrier dynamics, high carrier mobility, and flexibility, making it appealing for ultrafast, broadband, and flexible optoelectronics. To overcome its intrinsic limit of low absorption, hybrid structures are exploited to improve the device performance. Particularly, van der Waals heterostructures with different photosensitive materials and photonic structures are very effective for improving photodetection and modulation efficiency. With such hybrid structures, Gr hybrid photodetectors can operate from ultraviolet to terahertz, with significantly improved R (up to 109 A W&#8722;1) and bandwidth (up to 128 GHz). Furthermore, integration of Gr with silicon (Si) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, the human body, and soft tissues is successfully demonstrated, opening promising opportunities for wearable sensors and biomedical electronics. Here, the recent progress in using Gr hybrid structures toward high&#8208;performance photodetectors and integrated optoelectronic applications is reviewed.

      <title>Functional Materials Under Stress: In Situ TEM Observations of Structural Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Several examples of current progress regarding in situ mechanical scanning/transmission electron microscopy techniques are addressed. Probing of local microstructures from atomic to micrometer scales in functional materials that are under high stress loads is possible. Advancements of these state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques make it possible to study the behavior of materials with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution.








Abstract
The operating conditions of functional materials usually involve varying stress fields, resulting in structural changes, whether intentional or undesirable. Complex multiscale microstructures including defects, domains, and new phases, can be induced by mechanical loading in functional materials, providing fundamental insight into the deformation process of the involved materials. On the other hand, these microstructures, if induced in a controllable fashion, can be used to tune the functional properties or to enhance certain performance. In situ nanomechanical tests conducted in scanning/transmission electron microscopes (STEM/TEM) provide a critical tool for understanding the microstructural evolution in functional materials. Here, select results on a variety of functional material systems in the field are presented, with a brief introduction into some newly developed multichannel experimental capabilities to demonstrate the impact of these techniques.

      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the liquid&#8208;crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated geometric phase are briefly summarized, from nematic&#8208;LC&#8208;mediated transmissive to chiral&#8208;LC&#8208;mediated broadband reflective planar optics.

A comprehensive understanding of LC&#8208;based geometric phase planar optics and their numerous applications is provided.








Abstract
Planar optical elements that can manipulate the multidimensional physical parameters of light efficiently and compactly are highly sought after in modern optics and nanophotonics. In recent years, the geometric phase, induced by the photonic spin&#8211;orbit interaction, has attracted extensive attention for planar optics due to its powerful beam shaping capability. The geometric phase can usually be generated via inhomogeneous anisotropic materials, among which liquid crystals (LCs) have been a focus. Their pronounced optical properties and controllable and stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior introduce new possibilities for LCs beyond traditional panel displays. Recent advances in LC&#8208;mediated geometric phase planar optics are briefly reviewed. First, several recently developed photopatterning techniques are presented, enabling the accurate fabrication of complicated LC microstructures. Subsequently, nematic LC&#8208;based transmissive planar optical elements and chiral LC&#8208;based broadband reflective elements are reviewed systematically. Versatile functionalities are revealed, from conventional beam steering and focusing, to advanced structuring. Combining the geometric phase with structured LC materials offers a satisfactory platform for planar optics with desired functionalities and drastically extends exceptional applications of ordered soft matter. Some prospects on this rapidly advancing field are also provided.

      <title>Understanding the Instability of the Halide Perovskite CsPbI3 through Temperature&#8208;Dependent Structural Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>
The temperature dependence of the local and long&#8208;range structures of the halide perovskite CsPbI3 is studied. The Cs atom splits between two sites with the second site having a lower effective coordination number, suggesting that Cs rattles within the structure. Rattling, few Cs&#63743;I contacts, and the high degree of octahedral distortion explain the thermodynamic instability of perovskite&#8208;phase CsPbI3






.

Abstract
Despite the tremendous interest in halide perovskite solar cells, the structural reasons that cause the all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 to be unstable at room temperature remain mysterious, especially since many tolerance&#8208;factor&#8208;based approaches predict CsPbI3 should be stable as a perovskite. Here single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) measurements characterize bulk perovskite CsPbI3 from 100 to 295 K to elucidate its thermodynamic instability. While Cs occupies a single site from 100 to 150 K, it splits between two sites from 175 to 295 K with the second site having a lower effective coordination number, which, along with other structural parameters, suggests that Cs rattles in its coordination polyhedron. PDF measurements reveal that on the length scale of the unit cell, the Pb&#63743;I octahedra concurrently become greatly distorted, with one of the I&#63743;Pb&#63743;I angles approaching 82&#176; compared to the ideal 90&#176;. The rattling of Cs, low number of Cs&#63743;I contacts, and high degree of octahedral distortion cause the instability of perovskite&#8208;phase CsPbI3. These results reveal the limitations of tolerance factors in predicting perovskite stability and provide detailed structural information that suggests methods to engineer stable CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cells.

      <title>Bidirectional Catalysts for Liquid&#8211;Solid Redox Conversion in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The lithium&#8211;sulfur battery with long cycling stability is assembled with a specially designed bidirectional catalyst. The TiO2&#8211;Ni3S2 heterostructure catalyst realizes the smooth trapping&#8211;diffusion&#8211;conversion of polysulfides in the reduction process. The two components show catalytic activity toward the oxidation of Li2S. Thus, the shuttle effect and the formation of dead sulfides are effectively suppressed.








Abstract
Accelerated conversion by catalysis is a promising way to inhibit shuttling of soluble polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, but most of the reported catalysts work only for one direction sulfur reaction (reduction or oxidation), which is still not a root solution since fast cycled use of sulfur species is not finally realized. A bidirectional catalyst design, oxide&#8211;sulfide heterostructure, is proposed to accelerate both reduction of soluble polysulfides and oxidation of insoluble discharge products (e.g., Li2S), indicating a fundamental way for improving both the cycling stability and sulfur utilization. Typically, a TiO2&#8211;Ni3S2 heterostructure is prepared by in situ growing TiO2 nanoparticles on Ni3S2 surface and the intimately bonded interfaces are the key for bidirectional catalysis. For reduction, TiO2 traps while Ni3S2 catalytically converts polysulfides. For oxidation, TiO2 and Ni3S2 both show catalytic activity for Li2S dissolution, refreshing the catalyst surface. The produced sulfur cathode with TiO2&#8211;Ni3S2 delivers a low capacity decay of 0.038% per cycle for 900 cycles at 0.5C and specially, with a sulfur loading of 3.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, achieves a high capacity retention of 65% over 500 cycles at 0.3C. This work unlocks how a bidirectional catalyst works for boosting Li&#8211;S batteries approaching practical uses.

      <title>Organic&#8208;Salt&#8208;Assisted Crystal Growth and Orientation of Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites for Solar Cells with Efficiency over 19%</title>
      <dc:description>
A formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite, namely, (ThMA)2(FA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n&#160;= 5), is successfully demonstrated with high photovoltaic performance by using an organic&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystal growth method. The optimized device exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.06%, which is a record for quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite solar cells with nominal n&#8208;value lower than 6.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant attention due to their appealing environmental stability compared to their 3D counterparts. However, the relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) greatly limits their applications. Here, high photovoltaic performance is demonstrated for quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs using 2&#8208;thiophenemethylammonium as spacer with nominal n&#8208;value of 5, which is based on the stoichiometry of the precursors. The incorporation of formamidinium (FA) in quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskites reduces the bandgap and improves the light absorption ability, resulting in enlarged photocurrent and an increased PCE of 16.18%, which is higher than that of reported analogous methylammonium (MA)&#8208;based quasi&#8208;2D PSC (&#8776;15%). A record high PCE of 19.06% is further demonstrated by using an organic salt, namely, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzylammonium iodide, assisted crystal growth (OACG) technique, which can induce the crystal growth and orientation, tune the surface energy levels, and suppress the charge recombination losses. More importantly, the devices based on OACG&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskites show remarkable environmental stability and thermal stability, for example, the PCE retaining &#8776;96% of its initial value after storage at 80&#160;&#176;C for 576 h, while only &#8776;37% of the original efficiency left for FAPbI3&#8208;based
3D PSCs.

      <title>Optical Pliers: Micrometer&#8208;Scale, Light&#8208;Driven Tools Grown on Optical Fibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;powered microtools grown on optical fibers offer remotely controlled operation in the micrometer scale. UV light&#8208;induced polymerization is used to fabricate miniature elastomer actuators with different modes of photomechanical response, without resorting to complex microfabrication techniques. Two of the bending actuators are joined together to build optical pliers&#8212;a simple, light&#8208;driven tool for gripping and handling small objects.








Abstract
The ability to grip and handle small objects, from sub&#8208;millimeter electronic components to single&#8208;micrometer living cells, is vital for numerous ever&#8208;shrinking technologies. Mechanical grippers, powered by electric, pneumatic, hydraulic or piezoelectric servos, are well suited for the job at larger scales, but their complexity and need for force transmission prevent their miniaturization and remote control in tight spaces. Using liquid crystal elastomer microstructures that can change shape quickly and reversibly in response to light, a light&#8208;powered gripping tool&#8212;optical pliers&#8212;is built by growing two bending jaws on the tips of optical fibers. By delivering UV light to trigger polymerization via a micrometer&#8208;size fiber core, structures of similar size can be made without resorting to any microfabrication technology, such as laser photolithography. The tool is operated using visible light energy supplied through the fibers, with no force transmission. The elastomer growth technique readily offers micrometer&#8208;scale, remotely controlled functional structures with different modes of actuation as building blocks for the microtoolbox.

      <title>Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Robust Artificial Skins from a Biodegradable Sealant&#8208;Loaded Nanofiber Scaffold to Skin Tissue via Microfluidic Blow&#8208;Spinning</title>
      <dc:description>
An accessible method is proposed to enable large&#8208;area skin regeneration from a biodegradable sealant&#8208;loaded nanofiber scaffold (SNS) to skin tissue, showing great advantages and clinical significance in terms of wound healing, anti&#8208;infection, and tissue regeneration (reepithelialization, epidermal thinning, collagen alignment), solving the medical problems of large&#8208;area abdominal trauma.








Abstract
Given that many people suffer from large&#8208;area skin damage, skin regeneration is a matter of high concern. Here, an available method is developed for the formation of large&#8208;area robust skins through three stages: fabrication of a biodegradable sealant&#8208;loaded nanofiber scaffold (SNS), skin tissue reconstruction, and skin regeneration. First, a microfluidic blow&#8208;spinning strategy is proposed to fabricate a large&#8208;scale nanofiber scaffold with an area of 140&#160;cm &#215; 40&#160;cm, composed of fibrinogen&#8208;loaded polycaprolactone/silk fibroin (PCL/SF) ultrafine core&#8211;shell nanofibers with mean diameter of 65&#160;nm. Then, the SNS forms, where the gelling reaction of fibrin sealant occurs in situ between thrombin and fibrinogen on PCL/SF nanofiber surface, to promote the migration and proliferation of fibroblasts, accelerating skin regeneration. Through an in vivo study, it is shown that the SNS can rapidly repair acute tissue damage such as vascular bleeding and hepatic hemorrhage, and also promote angiogenesis, large&#8208;area abdominal wall defect repair, and wound tissue regeneration for medical problems in the world. Besides, it avoids the risk of immune rejection and secondary surgery in clinical applications. This strategy offers a facile route to regenerate large&#8208;scale robust skin, which shows great potential in abdominal wall defect repair.

      <title>Rational Design of Conjugated Small Molecules for Superior Photothermal Theranostics in the NIR&#8208;II Biowindow</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular surgery on &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules at the atomic level to tune optical absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared region is reported. With this technique, an absorption peak at 1060&#160;nm is achieved and its nanoparticle shows a record high photothermal conversion efficiency of 77% under 1064&#160;nm excitation, and high performance of in vivo photothermal theranostics is demonstrated.








Abstract
Extensive recent progress has been made on the design and applications of organic photothermal agents for biomedical applications because of their excellent biocompatibility comparing with inorganic materials. One major hurdle for the further development and applications of organic photothermal agents is the rarity of high&#8208;performance materials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, which allows deep tissue penetration and causes minimized side effects. Up till now, there have been few reported NIR&#8208;II&#8208;active photothermal agents and their photothermal conversion efficiencies are relatively low. Herein, optical absorption of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules from the first NIR window to the NIR&#8208;II window is precisely regulated by molecular surgery of substituting an individual atom. With this technique, the first demonstration of a conjugated oligomer (IR&#8208;SS) with an absorption peak beyond 1000&#160;nm is presented, and its nanoparticle achieves a record&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency of 77% under 1064&#160;nm excitation. The nanoparticles show a good photoacoustic response, photothermal therapeutic efficacy, and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. This work develops a strategy to boost the light&#8208;harvesting efficiency in the NIR&#8208;II window for cancer theranostics, offering an important step forward in advancing the design and application of NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents.

     alt="Rational Design of Conjugated Small Molecules for Superior Photothermal Theranostics in the NIR&#8208;II Biowindow"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular surgery on &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules at the atomic level to tune optical absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared region is reported. With this technique, an absorption peak at 1060&#160;nm is achieved and its nanoparticle shows a record high photothermal conversion efficiency of 77% under 1064&#160;nm excitation, and high performance of in vivo photothermal theranostics is demonstrated.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive recent progress has been made on the design and applications of organic photothermal agents for biomedical applications because of their excellent biocompatibility comparing with inorganic materials. One major hurdle for the further development and applications of organic photothermal agents is the rarity of high&#8208;performance materials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, which allows deep tissue penetration and causes minimized side effects. Up till now, there have been few reported NIR&#8208;II&#8208;active photothermal agents and their photothermal conversion efficiencies are relatively low. Herein, optical absorption of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules from the first NIR window to the NIR&#8208;II window is precisely regulated by molecular surgery of substituting an individual atom. With this technique, the first demonstration of a conjugated oligomer (IR&#8208;SS) with an absorption peak beyond 1000&#160;nm is presented, and its nanoparticle achieves a record&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency of 77% under 1064&#160;nm excitation. The nanoparticles show a good photoacoustic response, photothermal therapeutic efficacy, and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. This work develops a strategy to boost the light&#8208;harvesting efficiency in the NIR&#8208;II window for cancer theranostics, offering an important step forward in advancing the design and application of NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Charge Trapping&#8208;Based Electricity Generator (CTEG): An Ultrarobust and High Efficiency Nanogenerator for Energy Harvesting from Water Droplets</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel charge trapping&#8208;based electricity generator (CTEG) for passive energy harvesting from water droplets is presented. Ultrahigh charge densities, instantaneous currents, and power densities of 1.8 mC m&#8722;2, 2&#160;mA, and 162 W m&#8722;2 are reached, leading to an energy harvesting efficiency of 11.8%. Successful operation without degradation is demonstrated after up to 100 days from fabrication.








Abstract
Strategies toward harvesting energy from water movements are proposed in recent years. Reverse electrowetting allows high efficiency energy generation, but requires external electric field. Triboelectric nanogenerators, as passive energy harvesting devices, are limited by the unstable and low density of tribo&#8208;charges. Here, a charge trapping&#8208;based electricity generator (CTEG) is proposed for passive energy harvesting from water droplets with high efficiency. The hydrophobic fluoropolymer films utilized in CTEG are pre&#8208;charged by a homogeneous electrowetting&#8208;assisted charge injection (h&#8208;EWCI) method, allowing an ultrahigh negative charge density of 1.8 mC m&#8722;2. By utilizing a dedicated designed circuit to connect the bottom electrode and top electrode of a Pt wire, instantaneous currents beyond 2&#160;mA, power density above 160 W m&#8722;2, and energy harvesting efficiency over 11% are achieved from continuously falling water droplets. CTEG devices show excellent robustness for energy harvesting from water drops, without appreciable degradation for intermittent testing during 100 days. These results exceed previously reported values by far. The approach is not only applicable for energy harvesting from water droplets or wave&#8208;like oscillatory fluid motion, but also opens up avenues toward other applications requiring passive electric responses, such as diverse sensors and wearable devices.

      <title>Synergizing Mo Single Atoms and Mo2C Nanoparticles on CNTs Synchronizes Selectivity and Activity of Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <dc:description>
The multistep dinitrogen reduction reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a combined entity that consists of Mo single atoms and Mo2C nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes, predicted by theoretical calculations and verified by experiments. The two components with separate hydrogen evolution reaction and nitrogen reduction reaction selectivity synergize both the dinitrogen reduction selectivity and activity, realizing an improved ammonia production.








Abstract
Previous research of molybdenum&#8208;based electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has been largely considered on either isolated Mo single atoms (MoSAs) or Mo carbide particles (e.g., Mo2C) separately, while an integrated synergy (MoSAs&#8208;Mo2C) of the two has never been considered. The theoretical calculations show that the Mo single atoms and Mo2C nanoparticles exhibit, respectively, different catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and NRR selectivity. Therefore, a new role&#8208;playing synergistic mechanism can be well enabled for the multistep NRR, when the two are combined on the same N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). This hypothesis is confirmed experimentally, where the MoSAs&#8208;Mo2C assembled on NCNTs (MoSAs&#8208;Mo2C/NCNTs) yields an ammonia formation rate of 16.1&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cmcat&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.25&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is about four times that by the Mo2C alone (Mo2C/NCNTs) and 4.5 times that by the MoSAs alone (MoSAs/NCNTs). Moreover, the Faradic efficiency of the MoSAs&#8208;Mo2C/NCNTs is raised up to twofold and sevenfold of the Mo2C/NCNTs and MoSAs/NCNTs, respectively. The MoSAs&#8208;Mo2C/NCNTs also demonstrate outstanding stability by the almost unchanged catalytic performance over 10 h of the chronoamperometric test. The present study provides a promising new prototype of synchronizing the selectivity and activity for the multistep catalytic reactions.

      <title>Electronic&#8208;Grade High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Single Crystals by a Steady Self&#8208;Supply Solution Growth for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
      <dc:description>
A steady self&#8208;supply solution method with a continuously stable growth rate is designed to achieve electronic&#8208;grade high&#8208;quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single crystals. The crystal exhibits a low dislocation density, a low trap density, a high mobility, and a high mobility&#8211;lifetime product. The charge collection efficiency of a derived MAPbI3 X&#8208;ray detector is comparable to that of a traditional high&#8208;quality CdZnTe device.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality perovskite single crystals with large size are highly desirable for the fundamental research and high energy detection application. Here, a simple and convenient solution method, featuring continuous&#8208;mass transport process (CMTP) by a steady self&#8208;supply way, is shown to keep the growth of semiconductor single crystals continuously stable at a constant growth rate until an expected crystal size is achieved. A significantly reduced full width at half&#8208;maximum (36 arcsec) of the (400) plane from the X&#8208;ray rocking curve indicates a low angular dislocation of 6.8 &#215; 106 cm&#8722;2 and hence a higher crystalline quality for the CH3NH3PbI3(MAPbI3) single crystals grown by CMTP as compared to the conventional inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method. Furthermore, the CMTP&#8208;based single crystals have lower trap density, reduced by nearly 200% to 4.5 &#215; 109 cm&#8722;3, higher mobility increased by 187% to 150.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and higher mobility&#8211;lifetime product increased by around 450% to 1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1, as compared with the ITC&#8208;grown reference sample. The high performance of the CMTP&#8208;based MAPbI3 X&#8208;ray detector is comparable to that of a traditional high&#8208;quality CdZnTe device, indicating the CMTP method as being a cost&#8208;efficient strategy for high&#8208;quality electronic&#8208;grade semiconductor single crystals.

      <title>Immunomodulation&#8208;Enhanced Nanozyme&#8208;Based Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced nanozyme&#8208;based tumor catalytic treatment strategy is developed to fight against cancer. By regulating the tumor immune microenvironment, an increased generation level of hydrogen peroxide is demonstrated, thus effectively improving the catalytic activities of iron manganese silicate nanoparticle nanozymes. As a result, a high tumor therapeutic effect with a tumor inhibition rate of 87.5% is achieved.








Abstract
Nanozyme&#8208;based tumor catalytic therapy has attracted widespread attention in recent years. However, its therapeutic outcomes are diminished by many factors in the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration, hypoxia, and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Herein, an immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced nanozyme&#8208;based tumor catalytic therapy strategy is first proposed to achieve the synergism between nanozymes and TME regulation. TGF&#8208;&#946; inhibitor (TI)&#8208;loaded PEGylated iron manganese silicate nanoparticles (IMSN) (named as IMSN&#8208;PEG&#8208;TI) are constructed to trigger the therapeutic modality. The results show that IMSN nanozyme exhibits both intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like and catalase&#8208;like activities under acidic TME, which can decompose H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and oxygen (O2), respectively. Besides, it is demonstrated that both IMSN and TI can regulate the tumor immune microenvironment, resulting in macrophage polarization from M2 to M1, and thus inducing the regeneration of H2O2, which can promote catalytic activities of IMSN nanozyme. The potent antitumor effect of IMSN&#8208;PEG&#8208;TI is proved by in vitro multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) and in vivo CT26&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice models. It is believed that the immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced nanozyme&#8208;based tumor treatment strategy is a promising tool to kill cancer cells.

The results show that IMSN nanozyme exhibits both intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like and catalase&#8208;like activities under acidic TME, which can decompose H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively. Besides, it is demonstrated that both IMSN and TI can regulate the tumor immune microenvironment, resulting in macrophage polarization from M2 to M1, and thus inducing the regeneration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can promote catalytic activities of IMSN nanozyme. The potent antitumor effect of IMSN&#8208;PEG&#8208;TI is proved by in vitro multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) and in vivo CT26&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice models. It is believed that the immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced nanozyme&#8208;based tumor treatment strategy is a promising tool to kill cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Cathode Sodium Compensation for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of sodium&#8208;ion batteries has been hindered so far by the irreversible consumption of sodium ions of the cathode during the solid electrolyte interphase formation. Therefore, in search of a safe, cost&#8208;effective, and highly efficient cathode sodiation reagent, the feasibility of Na2C2O4 as a sodium reservoir source for enhancing the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries is investigated.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries have gained much attention for their potential application in large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to the low cost and abundant sodium sources in the earth. However, the electrochemical performance of sodium&#8208;ion full cells (SIFCs) suffers severely from the irreversible consumption of sodium ions of cathode during the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation of hard carbon anode. Here, a high&#8208;efficiency cathode sodiation compensation reagent, sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), which possesses both a high theoretical capacity of 400&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and a capacity utilization as high as 99%, is proposed. The implementation of Na2C2O4 as sacrificial sodium species is successfully realized by decreasing its oxidation potential from 4.41 to 3.97&#160;V through tuning conductive additives with different physicochemical features, and the corresponding mechanism of oxidation potential manipulation is analyzed. Electrochemical results show that in the full cell based on a hard carbon anode and a P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 cathode with Na2C2O4 as a sodium reservoir to compensate for sodium loss during SEI formation, the capacity retention is increased from 63% to 85% after 200 cycles and the energy density is improved from 129.2 to 172.6 W h kg&#8722;1. This work can provide a new avenue for accelerating the development of SIFCs.

      <title>Phase Engineering of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Unprecedentedly High Phase Purity, Stability, and Scalability via Molten&#8208;Metal&#8208;Assisted Intercalation</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;purity 1T&#8208;MoS2 is successfully synthesized by the molten&#8208;metal&#8208;assisted intercalation (MMI) approach, which exploits the capillary action of molten potassium metal and the difference between the electron affinity of MoS2 and the ionization potential of potassium. The potassium dopants maintain a high electron density in the Mo d orbitals. Consequently, the 1T&#8208;MoS2 (MMI) shows excellent phase stability and great promise as a non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst.








Abstract
The crystalline phase of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) directly determines their material property. The most thermodynamically stable phase structures in TMDs are the semiconducting 2H and metastable metallic 1T phases. To overcome the low phase purity and instability of 1T&#8208;TMDs, which limits the utilization of their intrinsic properties, various synthesis strategies for 1T&#8208;TMDs have been proposed in phase&#8208;engineering studies. Herein, a facile and scalable synthesis of 1T&#8208;phase molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) via the molten&#8208;metal&#8208;assisted intercalation (MMI) approach is introduced, which exploits the capillary action of molten potassium and the difference between the electron affinity of MoS2 and the ionization potential of potassium. Highly reactive molten potassium metal can readily intercalate into the MoS2 interlayers, inducing an efficient phase transition from the 2H to 1T crystal structure. The ionic bonding between the intercalated potassium and sulfur lowers the energy barrier of the 1T&#8208;phase transition, enhancing the phase stability of the 1T crystals. Owing to the high purity and stability of the 1T phase, the electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction is significantly higher in 1T&#8208;MoS2 (MMI) than in 2H&#8208;MoS2 and even in 1T&#8208;MoS2 synthesized using n&#8208;butyllithium.

      <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Inflatables with Programmable Shapes</title>
      <dc:description>
Kirigami principles are employed to design inflatables that mimic target shapes upon pressurization. A simple optimization routine enables the inflatables to transform into a family of target shapes at a given pressure. Single units can be selectively manipulated to reproduce features at different scales and ultimately enable a more accurate mimicking of the target.








Abstract
Kirigami, the Japanese art of paper cutting, has recently enabled the design of stretchable mechanical metamaterials that can be easily realized by embedding arrays of periodic cuts into an elastic sheet. Here, kirigami principles are exploited to design inflatables that can mimic target shapes upon pressurization. The system comprises a kirigami sheet embedded into an unstructured elastomeric membrane. First, it is shown that the inflated shape can be controlled by tuning the geometric parameters of the kirigami pattern. Then, by applying a simple optimization algorithm, the best parameters that enable the kirigami inflatables to transform into a family of target shapes at a given pressure are identified. Furthermore, thanks to the tessellated nature of the kirigami, it is shown that we can selectively manipulate the parameters of the single units to allow the reproduction of features at different scales and ultimately enable a more accurate mimicking of the&#160;target.

Abstract
High&#8208;nickel LiNi1&#8722;x&#8722;yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) and LiNi1&#8722;x&#8722;yCoxAlyO2 (NCA) are the cathode materials of choice for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Both NMC and NCA contain cobalt, an expensive and scarce metal generally believed to be essential for their electrochemical performance. Herein, a high&#8208;Ni LiNi1&#8722;x&#8722;yMnxAlyO2 (NMA) cathode of desirable electrochemical properties is demonstrated benchmarked against NMC, NCA, and Al&#8211;Mg&#8208;codoped NMC (NMCAM) of identical Ni content (89 mol%) synthesized in&#8208;house. Despite a slightly lower specific capacity, high&#8208;Ni NMA operates at a higher voltage by &#8776;40&#160;mV and shows no compromise in rate capability relative to NMC and NCA. In pouch cells paired with graphite, high&#8208;Ni NMA outperforms both NMC and NCA and only slightly trails NMCAM and a commercial cathode after 1000 deep cycles. Further, the superior thermal stability of NMA to NMC, NCA, and NMCAM is shown using differential scanning calorimetry. Considering the flexibility in compositional tuning and immediate synthesis scalability of high&#8208;Ni NMA very similar to NCA and NMC, this study opens a new space for cathode material development for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, cobalt&#8208;free Li&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;/i&gt;Al&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NMA) cathode of desirable electrochemical properties is demonstrated benchmarked against NMC, NCA, and Al&#8211;Mg&#8208;codoped NMC (NMCAM) of identical Ni content (89 mol%) synthesized in&#8208;house. Despite a slightly lower specific capacity, high&#8208;Ni NMA operates at a higher voltage by &#8776;40&#160;mV and shows no compromise in rate capability relative to NMC and NCA. In pouch cells paired with graphite, high&#8208;Ni NMA outperforms both NMC and NCA and only slightly trails NMCAM and a commercial cathode after 1000 deep cycles. Further, the superior thermal stability of NMA to NMC, NCA, and NMCAM is shown using differential scanning calorimetry. Considering the flexibility in compositional tuning and immediate synthesis scalability of high&#8208;Ni NMA very similar to NCA and NMC, this study opens a new space for cathode material development for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, cobalt&#8208;free Li&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anomalous Behavior of 2D Janus Excitonic Layers under Extreme Pressures</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;pressure studies on 2D Janus monolayers are reported. The pressure studies show that 2D Janus monolayers S&#8211;Mo&#8211;Se and S&#8211;W&#8211;Se do not undergo phase transition up to 15 GPa, but their vibrational modes exhibit a nonmonotonic response to pressure. The Janus S&#8211;W&#8211;Se monolayer undergoes an anomalous blueshifting behavior and direct to indirect bandgap transition.








Abstract
Newly discovered 2D Janus transition metal dichalcogenides layers have gained much attention from a theory perspective owing to their unique atomic structure and exotic materials properties, but little to no experimental data are available on these materials. Here, experimental and theoretical studies establish the vibrational and optical behavior of 2D Janus S&#8211;W&#8211;Se and S&#8211;Mo&#8211;Se monolayers under high pressures for the first time. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown classical transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) monolayers are first transferred onto van der Waals (vdW) mica substrates and converted to 2D Janus sheets by surface plasma technique, and then integrated into a 500 &#181;m size diamond anvil cell for high&#8208;pressure studies. The results show that 2D Janus layers do not undergo phase transition up to 15 GPa, and in this pressure regime, their vibrational modes exhibit a nonmonotonic response to the applied pressures (d&#969;/dP). Interestingly, these 2D Janus monolayers exhibit unique blueshift in photoluminescence (PL) upon compression, which is in contrast to many other traditional semiconductor materials. Overall theoretical simulations offer in&#8208;depth insights and reveal that the overall optical response is a result of competition between the ab&#8208;plane (blueshift) and c&#8208;axis (redshift) compression. The overall findings shed the very first light on how 2D Janus monolayers respond under extreme pressures and expand the fundamental understanding of these materials.

      <title>Measuring Piezoelectric Output&#8212;Fact or Friction?</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhancing the energy harvesting capabilities of piezoelectric polymers is a key challenge for next&#8208;generation wearable and remote technologies. Achieving this enhancement is challenging, and many literature reports confuse charge arising from contact electrification or triboelectricity with the piezoelectric effect. A simple solution is provided for the avoidance of this confusion with a framework enabling a robust literature discussion about the field moving forward.








Abstract
Piezoelectric polymers are emerging as exceptionally promising materials for energy harvesting. While the theoretical figures of merit for piezoelectric polymers are comparable to ceramics, the measurement techniques need to be retrofitted to account for the different mechanical properties of the softer polymeric materials. Here, how contact electrification, including friction and contact separation, is often mistaken for piezoelectric charge is examined, and a perspective for how to separate these effects is provided. The state of the literature is assessed, and recommendations are made for clear and simple guidelines in reporting, for both sample geometry and testing methods, to enable accurate determination of piezoelectric figures of merit in polymers. Such improvements will allow an understanding of what types of material manipulation are required in order to enhance the piezoelectric output from polymers and enable the next generation of polymer energy harvester design.

      <title>An Ultraviolet Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence OLED with Total External Quantum Efficiency over 9%</title>
      <dc:description>
The first example of UV&#8208;emissive thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter, namely CZ&#8208;MPS, is demonstrated successfully. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode using CZ&#8208;MPS as the guest material can emit efficient UV light with emission maximum (&#955;EL) of 389&#160;nm as well as a record&#8208;breaking total external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.3%.








Abstract
Owing to the difficulty in acquiring compounds with combined high energy bandgaps and lower&#8208;lying intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer excited states, the development of ultraviolet (UV) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials is quite challenging. Herein, through interlocking of the diphenylsulfone (PS) acceptor unit of a reported deep&#8208;blue TADF emitter (CZ&#8208;PS) by a dimethylmethylene bridge, CZ&#8208;MPS, a UV&#8208;emissive TADF compound bearing a shallower LUMO energy level and a more rigid structure than those of CZ&#8208;PS is achieved. This represents the first example of a UV&#8208;emissive TADF compound. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) using CZ&#8208;MPS as the guest material can emit efficient UV light with emission maximum of 389&#160;nm and maximum total external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.3%. Note that this EQEmax value is twice as high as the current record EQEmax (4.6%) for UV&#8208;OLEDs. This finding may shed light on the molecular design strategy for high&#8208;performance UV&#8208;OLED materials.

      <title>In Situ Grazing&#8208;Incidence Wide&#8208;Angle Scattering Reveals Mechanisms for Phase Distribution and Disorientation in 2D Halide Perovskite Films</title>
      <dc:description>
The mechanism of 2D halide perovskite film formation is resolved using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle scattering (GIWAXS). The film begins as a sol&#8211;gel precursor before first forming a 3D MAPbI3&#8208;like phase at the air/liquid interface. This acts as the template for the highly textured 2D phase with the layers perpendicular to the substrate, which grows closer to the substrate.








Abstract
2D hybrid halide perovskites with the formula (A&#8242;)2(A)n&#8208;1PbnI3n+1 have remarkable stability and promising efficiency in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet fundamental understanding of film formation, key to optimizing these devices, is lacking. Here, in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) is used to monitor film formation during spin&#8208;coating. This elucidates the general film formation mechanism of 2D halide perovskites during one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating. There are three stages of film formation: sol&#8211;gel, oriented 3D, and 2D. Three precursor phases form during the sol&#8211;gel stage and transform to perovskite, first giving a highly oriented 3D&#8208;like phase at the air/liquid interface followed by subsequent nucleations forming slightly less oriented 2D perovskite. Furthermore, heating before crystallization leads to fewer nucleations and faster removal of the precursors, improving orientation. This outlines the primary causes of phase distribution and perpendicular orientation in 2D perovskite films and paves the way for rationally designed film fabrication techniques.

      <title>Device Postannealing Enabling over 12% Efficient Solution&#8208;Processed Cu2ZnSnS4 Solar Cells with Cd2+ Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
A method of device annealing including an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer is proposed, acheiving an efficiency of 12.6% for Cd&#8208;alloyed Cu2ZnSnS4 thin&#8208;film solar cells. The VOC is increased by the reduction of both interface traps and deep&#8208;level defects, and fill factor enhancement is based on the favorable band alignment (conduction band offset) and ITO improvement after postannealing.








Abstract
Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 is a promising photovoltaic material containing low&#8208;cost, earth&#8208;abundant, and stable semiconductor elements. However, the highest power conversion efficiency of thin&#8208;film solar cells based on Cu2ZnSnS4 is only about 11% due to low open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor mainly caused by antisite defects and unfavorable heterojunction interface. In this work, a postannealing procedure is proposed to complete a Cd&#8208;alloyed Cu2ZnSnS4 device. The postannealing to complete the device significantly enhances the performance of the indium tin oxide and promotes the moderate interdiffusion of elements between the layers in the device. As a result of the diffusion of Cu, Zn, In, and Sn, the interfacial electron and hole densities are improved, leading to the achievement of a suitable band alignment for carrier transport. The postannealing also reduces the interface traps and deep&#8208;level defects, contributing to decreased nonradiative recombination. Therefore, the open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor are both improved, and an efficiency over 12% for pure sulfide&#8208;based kesterite thin&#8208;film solar cells is obtained.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells with Excellent Infrared Reflection and See&#8208;Through Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance semitransparent organic solar cells are achieved through the combined design efforts on the formulation of near&#8208;infrared ternary blends and optical control over photonic reflectors, which exhibit excellent features of power generation, they being see&#8208;through, and infrared reflection.








Abstract
Clean energy production and saving play vital impacts on the sustainability of the global community. Herein, high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) with excellent features of power generation, being see&#8208;through, and infrared reflection of heat dissipation, with promising perspectives for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) are reported. To simultaneously improve average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), formally in a trade&#8208;off relationship, of ST&#8208;OSCs, new ternary blends with alloy&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) acceptors are employed, which are effective to improve device efficiency while maintaining visible absorption unchanged, resulting in PCEs of 16.8% for opaque devices and 13.1% for semitransparent OSCs (AVT of 22.4% and infrared photon radiation rejection (IRR) of 77%). Further, multifunctional ST&#8208;OSCs are realized via introducing simple, yet effective photonic reflectors, together with optical simulation, leading to not only perfect fitting of the visible transmittance peak (555&#160;nm) to the photopic response of the human eye but also an excellent IRR of 90% (780&#8211;2500&#160;nm), along with 23% AVT and over 12% PCE. This is thought to be the best&#8208;performing multifunctional ST&#8208;OSC with promising prospects as BIPVs in terms of power generation, heat dissipation, and being see&#8208;through.

      <title>&#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 Bilayers via One&#8208;Step Deposition for Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A gradient grain&#8208;sized (GGS) CsPbI3 bilayer is developed to stabilize the &#945; phase via a single&#8208;step film&#8208;deposition process. The perovskite solar cell based on the GGS CsPbI3 bilayer shows an efficiency of 15.5% and operates stably for 1000 h under ambient conditions.








Abstract
The emerging inorganic CsPbI3 perovskites are promising wide&#8208;bandgap materials for application in tandem solar cells, but they tend to transit from a black &#945; phase to a yellow &#948; phase in ambient conditions. Herein, a gradient grain&#8208;sized (GGS) CsPbI3 bilayer is developed to stabilize the &#945; phase via a single&#8208;step film deposition process. The spontaneously upward migration of (adamantan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methanammonium (ADMA) based on the hot&#8208;casting technique causes self&#8208;assembly of the hierarchical morphology for the perovskite layers. Due to the strong steric effect of the surficial ADMA cation, a self&#8208;assembly tiny grain&#8208;sized CsPbI3 layer is in situ formed at the surface site, which exhibits notably enhanced phase stability by its high surface energy. Meanwhile, a large grain&#8208;sized CsPbI3 layer is obtained at the bottom site with high charge mobility and low trap density of states, which benefits from the regulated growth rates by the interaction between ADMA and perovskites. The perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on the GGS CsPbI3 bilayer shows an efficiency of 15.5% and operates stably for 1000 h under ambient conditions. This work confirms that redistributing the surface energy of perovskite films is a facile strategy to stabilize metastable PSCs without the cost of efficiency loss.

      <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Chemical and Physical Microstructure of Li Metal Anodes Revealed through Synchrotron&#8208;Based Imaging Techniques</title>
      <dc:description>
The influence of temperature on the electrochemical behavior of Li metal anodes in carbonate electrolyte is revealed through a series of synchrotron&#8208;based imaging techniques. X&#8208;ray computed tomography as well as energy&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray fluorescence mappings coupled with micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure are used to study the physical and chemical evolution of the Li metal anode from the micro to macroscales.








Abstract
The Li metal anode has been long sought&#8208;after for application in Li metal batteries due to its high specific capacity (3860 mAh g&#8722;1) and low electrochemical potential (&#8722;3.04 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode). Nevertheless, the behavior of Li metal in different environments has been scarcely reported. Herein, the temperature&#8208;dependent behavior of Li metal anodes in carbonate electrolyte from the micro&#8208; to macroscales are explored with advanced synchrotron&#8208;based characterization techniques such as X&#8208;ray computed tomography and energy&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray fluorescence mapping. The importance of testing methodology is exemplified, and the electrochemical behavior and failure modes of Li anodes cycled at different temperatures are discussed. Moreover, the origin of cycling performance at different temperatures is identified through analysis of Coulombic efficiencies, surface morphology, and the chemical composition of the solid electrolyte interphase in quasi&#8208;3D space with energy&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray fluorescence mappings coupled with micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure. This work provides new characterization methods for Li metal anodes and serves as an important basis toward the understanding of their electrochemical behavior in carbonate electrolytes at different temperatures.

      <title>A Highly Conductive Titanium Oxynitride Electron&#8208;Selective Contact for Efficient Photovoltaic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
TiOxNy films are demonstrated to be an excellent electron&#8208;selective contact for both crystalline silicon and organic solar cells. Remarkable efficiency of 22.3% and 17.02% is achieved for crystalline silicon and organic solar cells, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality carrier&#8208;selective contacts with suitable electronic properties are a prerequisite for photovoltaic devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, an efficient electron&#8208;selective contact, titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy), is developed for crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) and organic photovoltaic devices. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;deposited TiOxNy is demonstrated to be highly conductive with a proper work function (4.3&#160;eV) and a wide bandgap (3.4&#160;eV). Thin TiOxNy films simultaneously provide a moderate surface passivation and enable a low contact resistivity on c&#8208;Si surfaces. By implementation of an optimal TiOxNy&#8208;based contact, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCE of 22.3% is achieved for a c&#8208;Si solar cell featuring a full&#8208;area dopant&#8208;free electron&#8208;selective contact. Simultaneously, conductive TiOxNy is proven to be an efficient electron&#8208;transport layer for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. A remarkably high PCE of 17.02% is achieved for an OPV device with an electron&#8208;transport TiOxNy layer, which is superior to conventional ZnO&#8208;based devices with a PCE of 16.10%. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;deposited TiOxNy ETL on a large area with a high uniformity may help accelerate the commercialization of emerging solar technologies.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High&#8208;quality carrier&#8208;selective contacts with suitable electronic properties are a prerequisite for photovoltaic devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, an efficient electron&#8208;selective contact, titanium oxynitride (TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;), is developed for crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) and organic photovoltaic devices. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;deposited TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; is demonstrated to be highly conductive with a proper work function (4.3&#160;eV) and a wide bandgap (3.4&#160;eV). Thin TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; films simultaneously provide a moderate surface passivation and enable a low contact resistivity on c&#8208;Si surfaces. By implementation of an optimal TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;based contact, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCE of 22.3% is achieved for a c&#8208;Si solar cell featuring a full&#8208;area dopant&#8208;free electron&#8208;selective contact. Simultaneously, conductive TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; is proven to be an efficient electron&#8208;transport layer for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. A remarkably high PCE of 17.02% is achieved for an OPV device with an electron&#8208;transport TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; layer, which is superior to conventional ZnO&#8208;based devices with a PCE of 16.10%. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;deposited TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; ETL on a large area with a high uniformity may help accelerate the commercialization of emerging solar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasmonic Microspheres: Plasmonic Janus Microspheres Created from Pickering Emulsion Drops (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article 2001384, Shin&#8208;Hyun Kim and co&#8208;workers design plasmonic Janus microspheres using emulsion drops whose interface is decorated by particles. The emulsion drops made of acrylate resin are photopolymerized and the particles are removed. The directional deposition of the metal renders the top hemispheres as plasmonically colored and the position of the particles at the interface is precisely controlled by aging, which enables the tuning of the plasmonic property. The plasmonic colors can be switched on and off by controlling the orientation of the Janus microspheres with an external electric field.

      <title>Water Splitting: In Situ Formation of Oxygen Vacancies Achieving Near&#8208;Complete Charge Separation in Planar BiVO4 Photoanodes (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001385, Lianzhou Wang and co&#8208;workers develop a planar BiVO4 photoanode with in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed oxygen vacancies in the whole film for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. They reveal that, under AM 1.5 G illumination, oxygen vacancies increase the majority charge carrier density and photovoltage, leading to an excellent applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 2.76%.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2001268, Paolo Samor&#236; and co&#8208;workers report the fabrication of all&#8208;semiconducting mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures based on monolayer 2D MoS2 and bottom&#8208;up synthesized 1D graphene nanoribbons, which efficiently suppress the typical persistent photoconductivity effect of MoS2. Upon interfacing with physisorbed photochromic molecules, the charge transport of MoS2&#8211;graphene nanoribbons in field&#8208;effect transistors can be significantly photomodulated, which corresponds to multilevel output currents for high&#8208;performance optoelectronics.

      <title>Surface Ligand Management Aided by a Secondary Amine Enables Increased Synthesis Yield of CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dots and High Photovoltaic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Di&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine solution in methyl acetate as an efficient solid&#8208;state treatment for CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells is successfully demonstrated, and a record power conversion efficiency of &#8776;15% and high reproducibility are achieved for CsPbI3 PQD solar cells.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) or more broadly, nanocrystals possess advantageous features for solution&#8208;processed photovoltaic devices. The nanocrystal surface ligands play a crucial role in the transport of photogenerated carriers and ultimately affect the overall performance of PQD solar cells. Significantly improved CsPbI3 PQD synthetic yield and solar&#8208;cell performance through surface ligand management are demonstrated. The treatment of a secondary amine, di&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (DPA), provides a mild and efficient approach to control the surface ligand density of PQDs, which has an apparently different working mechanism compared to previously reported surface treatments. Using an optimal DPA concentration, the treatment can simultaneously remove both long&#8208;chain insulating surface ligands of oleic acid and oleylamine, even for unpurified PQDs with high ligand density. As a result, the electrical coupling between PQDs is enhanced, leading to improved charge transport, reduced carrier recombination, and a high power conversion efficiency approaching 15% for CsPbI3&#8208;PQD&#8208;based solar cells. In addition, the production yield of CsPbI3 PQDs can be increased by a factor of 8. These results highlight the importance of developing new ligand&#8208;management strategies, specifically for emerging PQDs to achieve scalable and high&#8208;performance perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

      <title>An Iron&#8208;Decorated Carbon Aerogel for Rechargeable Flow and Flexible Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The designed strategy of a mechanically integrated air electrode, realized by directional freeze&#8208;casting, generates a 3D honeycomb nanostructured Fe&#8208;decorated carbon aerogel with satisfactory mechanical stability and gas/electrolyte diffusion channels. Such an integrated monolith with superb bifunctional electrocatalytic activity shows a remarkable performance as the free&#8208;standing air cathode in a flow Zn&#8211;air battery (ZAB) and flexible solid&#8208;state ZAB.








Abstract
Mechanically stable and foldable air cathodes with exceptional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities are key components of wearable metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a directional freeze&#8208;casting and annealing approach is reported for the construction of a 3D honeycomb nanostructured, N,P&#8208;doped carbon aerogel incorporating in situ grown FeP/Fe2O3 nanoparticles as the cathode in a flexible Zn&#8211;air battery (ZAB). The aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries assembled with this carbon aerogel exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 648 mAh g&#8722;1 at a current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a good long&#8208;term durability, outperforming those assembled with commercial Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst. Furthermore, such a foldable carbon aerogel with directional channels can serve as a freestanding air cathode for flexible solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;air batteries without the use of carbon paper/cloth and additives, giving a specific capacity of 676&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 517 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 together with good cycling stability. This work offers a new strategy to design and synthesize highly effective bifunctional air cathodes to be applied in electrochemical energy devices.

      <title>3D Two&#8208;Photon Microprinting of Nanoporous Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Combining self&#8208;assembly on the nanoscale and two&#8208;photon 3D laser printing on the micrometer scale, complex nanoporous 3D architectures are achieved. The underlying photoresist relies on polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation between a polymer and a nonpolymerizable phase. Control of the porosity by the printing parameters is demonstrated by sample characterization based on ultramicrotomy, scanning electron microscopy, and optical transmission.








Abstract
A photoresist system for 3D two&#8208;photon microprinting is presented, which enables the printing of inherently nanoporous structures with mean pore sizes around 50&#8197;nm by means of self&#8208;organization on the nanoscale. A phase separation between polymerizable and chemically inert photoresist components leads to the formation of 3D co&#8208;continuous structures. Subsequent washing&#8208;out of the unpolymerized phase reveals the porous polymer structures. To characterize the volume properties of the printed structures, scanning electron microscopy images are recorded from ultramicrotome sections. In addition, the light&#8208;scattering properties of the 3D&#8208;printed material are analyzed. By adjusting the printing parameters, the porosity can be controlled during 3D printing. As an application example, a functioning miniaturized Ulbricht light&#8208;collection sphere is 3D printed and tested.

      <title>Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Anisotropic Excitons in Few&#8208;Layer ReS2</title>
      <dc:description>
Linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes are demonstrated using few&#8208;layer ReS2, a 2D semiconductor with reduced in&#8208;plane symmetry. Two excitonic electroluminescence peaks exhibiting high degrees of linear polarization of &#8776;80% are observed in near&#8208;infrared frequencies. Hot hole injection through a hBN tunneling layer is shown to be key to the activation of hot exciton emission.








Abstract
An on&#8208;chip polarized light source is desirable in signal processing, optical communication, and display applications. Layered semiconductors with reduced in&#8208;plane symmetry have inherent anisotropic excitons that are attractive candidates as polarized dipole emitters. Herein, the demonstration of polarized light&#8208;emitting diode based on anisotropic excitons in few&#8208;layer ReS2, a 2D semiconductor with excitonic transition energy of 1.5&#8211;1.6 eV, is reported. The light&#8208;emitting device is based on minority carrier (hole) injection into n&#8208;type ReS2 through a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel barrier in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) van der Waals heterostack. Two distinct emission peaks from excitons are observed at near&#8208;infrared wavelength regime from few&#8208;layer ReS2. The emissions exhibit a degree of polarization of 80% reflecting the nearly 1D nature of excitons in ReS2.

      <dc:description>

After systematic optimization, a triboelectric self&#8208;powered angle sensor provides high&#8208;quality sensing signals while itself needing neither electric power supply nor a signal&#8208;amplification module.

Abstract
As the dominant component for precise motion measurement, angle sensors play a vital role in robotics, machine control, and personalized rehabilitation. Various forms of angle sensors have been developed and optimized over the past decades, but none of them would function without an electric power. Here, a highly sensitive triboelectric self&#8208;powered angle sensor (SPAS) exhibiting the highest resolution (2.03 nano&#8208;radian) after a comprehensive optimization is reported. In addition, the SPAS holds merits of light weight and thin thickness, which enables its extensive integrated applications with minimized energy consumption: a palletizing robotic arm equipped with the SPAS can precisely reproduce traditional Chinese calligraphy via angular data it collects. In addition, the SPAS can be assembled in a medicare brace to record the flexion/extension of joints, which may benefit personalized orthopedic recuperation. The SPAS paves a new approach for applications in the emerging fields of robotics, sensing, personalized medicare, and artificial intelligence.

      <title>Advances in Antimicrobial Microneedle Patches for Combating Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
Antimicrobial microneedle (MN) patches are portable medical devices for combating skin infections. Contrary to conventional topical administration, MNs enhance the bioavailability of antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral therapeutics to skin and eye. These promising armaments release their cargo in controlled release. They can respond to biosignals such as changes in pH and microbial enzyme load at the infection site.








Abstract
Skin infections caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi are difficult to treat by conventional topical administration because of poor drug penetration across the stratum corneum. This results in low bioavailability of drugs to the infection site, as well as the lack of prolonged release. Emerging antimicrobial transdermal and ocular microneedle patches have become promising medical devices for the delivery of various antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral therapeutics. In the present review, skin anatomy and its barriers along with skin infection are discussed. Potential strategies for designing antimicrobial microneedles and their targeted therapy are outlined. Finally, biosensing microneedle patches associated with personalized drug therapy and selective toxicity toward specific microbial species are discussed.

      <title>Ion Exchange Gels Allow Organic Electrochemical Transistor Operation with Hydrophobic Polymers in Aqueous Solution</title>
      <dc:description>
Inserting an ion exchange gel between the hydrophobic polymer active layer of an organic transistor and the aqueous electrolyte enables volumetric doping of the active layer and operation as an organic electrochemical transistor, rather than as an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect. With the ion gel, the transconductance increases by &#8776;10 000&#215;, enabling the recording of biological action potentials.








Abstract
Conjugated&#8208;polymer&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are being studied for applications ranging from biochemical sensing to neural interfaces. While new polymers that interface digital electronics with the aqueous chemistry of life are being developed, the majority of high&#8208;performance organic transistor materials are poor at transporting biologically relevant ions. Here, the operating mode of an organic transistor is changed from that of an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistor (EGOFET) to that of an OECT by incorporating an ion exchange gel between the active layer and the aqueous electrolyte. This device works by taking up biologically relevant ions from solution and injecting more hydrophobic ions into the active layer. Using poly[2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;tetradecylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene] as the active layer and a blend of an ionic liquid, 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) as the ion exchange gel, four orders of magnitude improvement in device transconductance and a 100&#8208;fold increase in kinetics are demonstrated. The ability of the ion&#8208;exchange&#8208;gel OECT to record biological signals by measuring the action potentials of a Venus flytrap is demonstrated. These results show the possibility of using interface engineering to open up a wider palette of organic semiconductors as OECTs that can be gated by aqueous solutions.

      <title>Supramolecular Porous Organic Nanocomposites for Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of a Sulfur Mustard Simulant</title>
      <dc:description>
A supramolecular photosensitizer with efficient intersystem crossing is achieved by combining the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated with heavy atoms and the photoinduced electron transfer in a donor&#8211;acceptor host&#8211;guest dyad. Incorporation of these supramolecular cationic photosensitizers with anionic polymer matrices generates porous nanocomposites with remarkable photocatalytic performances against sulfur mustard simulant.








Abstract
Efficient heterogeneous photosensitizing materials require both large accessible surface areas and excitons of suitable energies and with well&#8208;defined spin structures. Confinement of the tetracationic cyclophane (ExBox4+) within a nonporous anionic polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) matrix leads to a surface area increase of up to 225 m2 g&#8722;1 in ExBox&#8226;PSS. Efficient intersystem crossing is achieved by combining the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated to Br heavy atoms in 1,3,5,8&#8208;tetrabromopyrene (TBP), and the photoinduced electron transfer in a TBP&#8834;ExBox4+ supramolecular dyad. The TBP&#8834;ExBox4+ complex displays a charge transfer band at 450 nm and an exciplex emission at 520 nm, indicating the formation of new mixed&#8208;electronic states. The lowest triplet state (T1, 1.89 eV) is localized on the TBP and is close in energy with the charge separated state (CT, 2.14 eV). The homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalytic activities of the TBP&#8834;ExBox4+, for the elimination of a sulfur mustard simulant, has proved to be significantly more efficient than TBP and ExBox+4, confirming the importance of the newly formed excited&#8208;state manifold in TBP&#8834;ExBox4+ for the population of the low&#8208;lying T1 state. The high stability, facile preparation, and high performance of the TBP&#8834;ExBox&#8226;PSS nanocomposites augur well for the future development of new supramolecular heterogeneous photosensitizers using host&#8211;guest chemistry.

      <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency CoSe Electrocatalyst with Hierarchical Porous Polyhedron Nanoarchitecture for Accelerating Polysulfides Conversion in Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency CoSe electrocatalyst with hierarchical porous polyhedron nanoarchitecture (CS@HPP) is presented as a sulfur host for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The CS@HPP with high electrical conductivity and abundant active sites can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of polysulfides and precipitation/decomposition of Li2S. Consequently, excellent electrochemical performance is synchronously displayed for both slurry&#8208;bladed and freestanding cathodes.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are recognized as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and cost&#8208;effective raw materials. However, the sluggish multielectron sulfur redox reactions are the root cause of most of the issues for Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;efficiency CoSe electrocatalyst with hierarchical porous nanopolyhedron architecture (CS@HPP) derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework is presented as the sulfur host for Li&#8211;S batteries. The CS@HPP with high crystal quality and abundant reaction active sites can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of polysulfides and precipitation/decomposition of Li2S. Thus, the CS@HPP sulfur cathode exhibits an excellent capacity of 1634.9 mAh g&#8722;1, high rate performance, and a long cycle life with a low capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle over 1200 cycles. CoSe nanopolyhedrons are further fabricated on a carbon cloth framework (CC@CS@HPP) to unfold the electrocatalytic activity by its high electrical conductivity and large surface area. A freestanding CC@CS@HPP sulfur cathode with sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 delivers a high areal capacity of 8.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 under a lean electrolyte. This work will enlighten the rational design of structure&#8211;catalysis engineering of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials for diverse applications.

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Autophagy Cascade Amplification Nanoparticles Precisely Enhanced Oxaliplatin&#8208;Induced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An on&#8208;demand autophagy cascade amplification nanoparticle (ASN) is established to intelligently boost oxaliplatin (OXA)&#8208;induced immunotherapy of cancer cells. Upon arrival at tumor site, ASN first releases OXA to trigger tumor immunogenic death and stimulates autophagy. Then ASN can respond to the OXA&#8208;induced autophagy and further overactivate autophagy, which not only leads tumor to autophagic death but also enhances immune cell recruitment.








Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immune response is highly dependent on tumor autophagy. When tumor cells are treated with chemoimmunotherapy, timely overactivated autophagy can not only lead more tumor cells to death, but also participate in the endogenous antigen presentation and immune stimulators secretion of dying cells, thus plays a vital role. However, timely and accurately overactivated tumor autophagy during chemoimmunotherapy is of great difficulty. Here, an on&#8208;demand autophagy cascade amplification nanoparticle (ASN) is reported to boost oxaliplatin&#8208;induced cancer immunotherapy. ASN is prepared by self&#8208;assemble of autophagy&#8208;responsible C&#8208;TFG micelle and is followed by electrostatic binding of oxaliplatin prodrug (HA&#8208;OXA). After entering tumor cells, the HA&#8208;OXA shell of ASN first responds to the reduction microenvironment and releases oxaliplatin to trigger tumor immunogenic cell death and mildly stimulates tumor autophagy. Then, the exposed C&#8208;TFG micelle can sensitively respond to oxaliplatin&#8208;induced autophagy and release a powerful autophagy inducer STF&#8208;62247, which precisely transforms autophagy to &#8220;overactivated&#8221; condition, leading tumor cells to autophagic death and enhance subsequent tumor antigen processing of the dying cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, ASN exhibits optimal immune stimulation and antitumor efficiency due to its on&#8208;demand autophagy induction ability.

&lt;p&gt;An on&#8208;demand autophagy cascade amplification nanoparticle (ASN) is established to intelligently boost oxaliplatin (OXA)&#8208;induced immunotherapy of cancer cells. Upon arrival at tumor site, ASN first releases OXA to trigger tumor immunogenic death and stimulates autophagy. Then ASN can respond to the OXA&#8208;induced autophagy and further overactivate autophagy, which not only leads tumor to autophagic death but also enhances immune cell recruitment.

      <title>Initiating a Reversible Aqueous Zn/Sulfur Battery through a &#8220;Liquid Film&#8221;</title>
      <dc:description>
The first reliable aqueous Zn/S system is activated by a &#8220;liquid film&#8221; comprising an ionic liquid (IL) encapsulated within PEDOT:PSS. CF3SO3&#8722; anions in the IL operate as Zn2+&#8208;transfer channels. The PEDOT:PSS network renders the polysulfide cathode with enhanced structural stability.

Abstract
Sulfur cathodes have been under intensive study in various systems, such as Li/S, Na/S, Mg/S, and Al/S batteries. However, to date, Zn/S chemistry has never been reported. The first reliable aqueous Zn/polysulfide system activated by a &#8220;liquid film&#8221; comprising 4&#8208;(3&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;imidazolio)&#8208;1&#8208;butanesulfoni ionic liquid (IL) encapsulated within PEDOT:PSS. CF3SO3&#8722; anions in the IL operating as Zn2+&#8208;transfer channels is reported. Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS network retains the IL, which renders Zn2+&#8208;transfer channels and a polysulfide cathode with enhanced structural stability. The Zn/polysulfide system delivers extraordinary capacity of 1148 mAh g&#8722;1 and overwhelming energy density of 724.7&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode at 0.3 Ag&#8722;1. During the discharging phase, S62&#8722; is dominantly reduced by Zn to S2&#8722; (S6&#8197; &#8594; &#8197;S2&#8722;). During the charging phase, these short chains are oxidized to form long&#8208;chain ZnxLiyS3&#8208;6. A further optimized high&#8208;concentrated salt electrolyte is used to improve the reversibility of the battery, demonstrating an extended lifetime over 1600 cycles at 1 Ag&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 204 mAh g&#8722;1. This facile approach and the superior performance of the developed aqueous Zn/S chemistry provide a new platform for sulfur&#8208;based battery and potentially solve the problems of other metal/sulfur batteries.

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Crystalline Structural Transformation for Lead&#8208;Free Inorganic Halide Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
Silver atoms incorporated into the inorganic halide perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9 to form Cs2AgBiBr6 eliminates the strong localization of electron&#8211;hole pairs and makes the electronic bands distribution more dispersible and further changes the photoelectric properties including band structure, exciton binding energy, charge carrier mobility, and carrier relaxation lifetime, which lead to a remarkable enhancement in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free inorganic halide perovskites have triggered appealing interests in various energy&#8208;related applications including solar cells and photocatalysis. However, why perovskite&#8208;structured materials exhibit excellent photoelectric properties and how the unique crystalline structures affect the charge behaviors are still not well elucidated but essentially desired. Herein, taking inorganic halide perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9 as a prototype, the significant derivation process of silver atoms incorporation to induce the structural transformation from Cs3Bi2Br9 to Cs2AgBiBr6, which brings about dramatic differences in photoelectric properties is unraveled. It is demonstrated that the silver incorporation results in the co&#8208;operated orbitals hybridization, which makes the electronic distributions in conduction and valence bands of Cs2AgBiBr6 more dispersible, eliminating the strong localization of electron&#8211;hole pairs. As consequences of the electronic structures derivation, exhilarating changes in photoelectric properties like band structure, exciton binding energy, and charge carrier dynamics are verified experimentally and theoretically. Using photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity under visible light as a typical evaluation, such crystalline structure transformation contributes to a more than 100&#8208;fold enhancement in photocatalytic performances compared with pristine Cs3Bi2Br9, verifying the significant effect of structural derivations on the exhibited performances. The findings will provide evidences for understanding the origin of photoelectric properties for perovskites semiconductors in solar energy conversion.

      <title>A Highly Crystalline Perylene Imide Polymer with the Robust Built&#8208;In Electric Field for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
A crystalline perylene imide polymer photocatalyst with the highest oxygen evolution performance is achieved. The polymer can be reused over 100 h without any decrease in performance overcoming the poor stability of the organic photocatalysts. The superior photocatalytic performance comes from the suitable energy band and the robust built&#8208;in electric field contributed by the highly crystallinity and large molecular dipole.








Abstract
A highly crystalline perylene imide polymer (Urea&#8208;PDI) photocatalyst is successfully constructed. The Urea&#8208;PDI presents a wide spectrum response owing to its large conjugated system. The Urea&#8208;PDI performs so far highest oxygen evolution rate (3223.9 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) without cocatalysts under visible light. The performance is over 107.5 times higher than that of the conventional PDI supramolecular photocatalysts. The strong oxidizing ability comes from the deep valence band (+1.52 eV) which is contributed by the covalent&#8208;bonded conjugated molecules. Besides, the high crystallinity and the large molecular dipoles of the Urea&#8208;PDI contribute to a robust built&#8208;in electric field promoting the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the Urea&#8208;PDI is very stable and has no performance attenuation after 100 h continuous irradiation. The Urea&#8208;PDI polymer photocatalyst provides with a new platform for the use of photocatalytic water oxidation, which is expected to contribute to clean energy production.

      <title>A Graphdiyne Oxide&#8208;Based Iron Sponge with Photothermally Enhanced Tumor&#8208;Specific Fenton Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
A tumor targeting iron sponge (TTIS) based on graphdiyne oxide is fabricated with controlled iron release. The TTIS can accumulate in tumor tissue to achieve a photoacoustic&#8208; and magnetic resonance tumor imaging and simultaneously escort an efficient tumor therapy via photothermally enhanced Fenton chemistry.








Abstract
Fenton reaction&#8208;mediated oncotherapy is an emerging strategy which uses iron ions to catalytically convert endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, the most reactive oxygen species found in biology, for efficient cancer therapy. However, Fenton reaction efficiency in tumor tissue is typically limited due to restrictive conditions. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is to increase the temperature specifically at the tumor site. Herein, a tumor&#8208;targeting iron sponge (TTIS) nanocomposite based on graphdiyne oxide, which has a high affinity for iron is described. TTIS can accumulate in tumor tissue by decoration with a tumor&#8208;targeting polymer to enable tumor photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. With its excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (37.5%), TTIS is an efficient photothermal therapy (PTT) agent. Moreover, the heat produced in the process of PTT can accelerate the release of iron ions from TTIS and simultaneously enhance the efficiency of the Fenton reaction, thus achieving a combined PTT and Fenton reaction&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. This work introduces a graphdiyne oxide&#8208;based iron sponge that exerts an enhanced antitumor effect through PTT and Fenton chemistry.

TTIS can accumulate in tumor tissue by decoration with a tumor&#8208;targeting polymer to enable tumor photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. With its excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (37.5%), TTIS is an efficient photothermal therapy (PTT) agent. Moreover, the heat produced in the process of PTT can accelerate the release of iron ions from TTIS and simultaneously enhance the efficiency of the Fenton reaction, thus achieving a combined PTT and Fenton reaction&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. This work introduces a graphdiyne oxide&#8208;based iron sponge that exerts an enhanced antitumor effect through PTT and Fenton chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Variant Solid Solutions Cs2Sn1&#8211;xTexCl6: Bright Luminescence and High Anti&#8208;Water Stability</title>
      <dc:description>
Cs2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 exhibits excellent moisture and thermal stability (upon 618 oC) and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (95.4%), which is caused by the combination of Te luminescent center and Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;like self&#8208;trapped excitons. There is no photoluminescence degradation even after 360 min of soaking in water. The good stability is due to the large decomposition enthalpy and formation of amorphous alteration phase.








Abstract
Underwater lighting is important for the exploration of the underwater world in different areas. It is of great significance for developing underwater emitters with high penetrability, high luminous efficiency, good anti&#8208;water stability, and environmental friendliness. Stable lead&#8208;free perovskite luminescent materials, represented by vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskites, are worthy of research because they can almost meet the above requirements. Here, lead&#8208;free perovskite variant solid solutions with the formula of Cs2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 are reported. Upon the exchange of Sn/Te ions, strong Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of octahedra occurs in the lattice structure. The combination of Te luminescent center and Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;like self&#8208;trapped excitons gives this material yellow&#8208;green luminescence with a wavelength of 580 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95.4%. Moreover, these solid solutions can withstand the extreme conditions of immersion in water probably due to the formation of amorphous alteration phase. Such good anti&#8208;water stability is also supported by the molecule dynamics simulation result that no reaction occurs on the water/Cs2SnCl6 interface. The high luminous, suitable wavelength, and good anti&#8208;water stability enable the solid solutions suitable for the application for underwater lighting.

      <title>Bulk Spin Torque&#8208;Driven Perpendicular Magnetization Switching in L10 FePt Single Layer</title>
      <dc:description>
Bulk spin torque&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching in an L10 FePt single&#8208;layer arises from an inherent structural gradient and exhibits great potential for removing the fundamental obstacles faced by conventional spin&#8211;orbit torque devices, such as thermal stability issues and complexity issues regarding three&#8208;terminal operation.








Abstract
Due to its inherent superior perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the FePt in L10 phase enables magnetic storage and memory devices with ultrahigh capacity. However, reversing the FePt magnetic state, and therefore encoding information, has proven to be extremely difficult. Here, it is demonstrated that an electric current can exert a large spin torque on an L10 FePt magnet, ultimately leading to reversible magnetization switching. The spin torque monotonically increases with increasing FePt thickness, exhibiting a bulk characteristic. Meanwhile, the spin torque effective fields and switching efficiency increase as the FePt approaches higher chemical ordering with stronger spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The symmetry breaking that generates spin torque within L10 FePt is shown to arise from an inherent structural gradient along the film normal direction. By artificially reversing the structural gradient, an opposite spin torque effect in L10 FePt is demonstrated. At last, the role of the disorder gradient in generating a substantial torque in a single ferromagnet is supported by theoretical calculations. These results will push forward the frontier of material systems for generating spin torques and will have a transformative impact on magnetic storage and spin memory devices with simple architecture, ultrahigh density, and readily application.

      <dc:description>
The impact of molecular/ionic fillers on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blends&#8217; triboelectric performance is investigated through systematic material engineering, and characterization of PVA blends at different structure levels. Self&#8208;powered devices built with optimized PVA&#8211;gelatin composite films are capable of detecting the imperceptible degree of skin deformation induced by the human pulse and capture the cardiovascular information encoded in the pulse signals.








Abstract
The capability of sensor systems to efficiently scavenge their operational power from stray, weak environmental energies through sustainable pathways could enable viable schemes for self&#8208;powered health diagnostics and therapeutics. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) can effectively transform the otherwise wasted environmental, mechanical energy into electrical power. Recent advances in TENGs have resulted in a significant boost in output performance. However, obstacles hindering the development of efficient triboelectric devices based on biocompatible materials continue to prevail. Being one of the most widely used polymers for biomedical applications, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) presents exciting opportunities for biocompatible, wearable TENGs. Here, the holistic engineering and systematic characterization of the impact of molecular and ionic fillers on PVA blends&#8217; triboelectric performance is presented for the first time. Triboelectric devices built with optimized PVA&#8208;gelatin composite films exhibit stable and robust triboelectricity outputs. Such wearable devices can detect the imperceptible skin deformation induced by the human pulse and capture the cardiovascular information encoded in the pulse signals with high fidelity. The gained fundamental understanding and demonstrated capabilities enable the rational design and holistic engineering of novel materials for more capable biocompatible triboelectric devices that can continuously monitor vital physiological signals for self&#8208;powered health diagnostics and therapeutics.

      <title>Gradient&#8208;Concentration Design of Stable Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructure for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly active Pt&#8211;Ni@PtD/G catalysts with extraordinary stability for acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are synthesized by a gradient&#8208;concentration strategy (i.e., starting with facile galvanic replacement followed by partial dealloying). The optimal &#8220;armor&#8221; with active and dense locally concave Pt atomic sites is responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in acidic ORR.








Abstract
Manipulating the surface structure of electrocatalysts at the atomic level is of primary importance to simultaneously achieve the activity and stability dual&#8208;criteria in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Here, a durable acidic ORR electrocatalyst with the &#8220;defective&#8208;armored&#8221; structure of Pt shell and Pt&#8211;Ni core nanoparticle decorated on graphene (Pt&#8211;Ni@PtD/G) using a facile and controllable galvanic replacement reaction to generate gradient distribution of Pt&#8211;Ni composition from surface to interior, followed by a partial dealloying approach, leaching the minor nickel atoms on the surface to generate defective Pt skeleton shell, is reported. The Pt&#8211;Ni@PtD/G catalyst shows impressive performance for ORR in acidic (0.1 m HClO4) electrolyte, with a high mass activity of threefold higher than that of Pt/C catalyst owing to the tuned electronic structure of locally concave Pt surface sites through synergetic contributions of Pt&#8211;Ni core and defective Pt shell. More importantly, the electrochemically active surface areas still retain 96% after 20&#8239;000 potential cycles, attributing to the Pt atomic shell acting as the protective &#8220;armor&#8221; to prevent interior Ni atoms from further dissolution during the long&#8208;term operation.

      <title>Highly Efficient Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Heavy Atom&#8208;Free Molecules Triggered by Hidden Long Phosphorescent Antenna</title>
      <dc:description>
The extension of the conjugated antenna units relating transition from high order singlet excited states in heavy atom&#8208;free chromophores greatly enhances the phosphorescence rate (kp) without a large increase of vibration&#8208;based radiationless transition rate (knr(RT)) with large triplet yield, which results in the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) yield (&#934;p(RT)) of 50% as well as the RTP lifetime (&#964;p(RT)) of 1.0 s.








Abstract
Persistent (lifetime &gt; 100 ms) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) is important for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art security and bioimaging applications. An unclear relationship between chromophores and physical parameters relating to pRTP has prevented obtaining an RTP yield of over 50% and a lifetime over 1 s. Here highly efficient pRTP is reported under ambient conditions from heavy atom&#8208;free chromophores. A heavy atom&#8208;free aromatic core substituted with a long&#8208;conjugated amino group considerably accelerates the phosphorescence rate independent of the intramolecular vibration&#8208;based nonradiative rate from the lowest excited triplet state. One of the designed heavy atom&#8208;free dopant chromophores presents an RTP yield of 50% with a lifetime of 1 s under ambient conditions. The afterglow brightness under strong excitation is at least 104 times stronger than that of conventional long&#8208;persistent luminescence emitters. Here it is shown that highly efficient pRTP materials allow for high&#8208;resolution gated emission with a size of the diffraction limit using small&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost photodetectors.

&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) without a large increase of vibration&#8208;based radiationless transition rate (&lt;i&gt;k &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt;(RT)) with large triplet yield, which results in the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) yield (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(RT)) of 50% as well as the RTP lifetime (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(RT)) of 1.0 s.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistent (lifetime &amp;gt; 100 ms) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt;RTP) is important for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art security and bioimaging applications. An unclear relationship between chromophores and physical parameters relating to &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt;RTP has prevented obtaining an RTP yield of over 50% and a lifetime over 1 s. Here highly efficient &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt;RTP is reported under ambient conditions from heavy atom&#8208;free chromophores. A heavy atom&#8208;free aromatic core substituted with a long&#8208;conjugated amino group considerably accelerates the phosphorescence rate independent of the intramolecular vibration&#8208;based nonradiative rate from the lowest excited triplet state. One of the designed heavy atom&#8208;free dopant chromophores presents an RTP yield of 50% with a lifetime of 1 s under ambient conditions. The afterglow brightness under strong excitation is at least 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; times stronger than that of conventional long&#8208;persistent luminescence emitters. Here it is shown that highly efficient &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt;RTP materials allow for high&#8208;resolution gated emission with a size of the diffraction limit using small&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2D Inorganic Bimolecular Crystals with Strong In&#8208;Plane Anisotropy for Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <dc:description>
For the first time, 2D inorganic bimolecular crystals SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts are successfully prepared by a facile vertical microspacing sublimation strategy. The SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts show strong in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy with high dichroic ratio up to 3.9 due to the anisotropy of phonon vibrations and intramolecular vibrations. Moreover, the second harmonic generation intensity of SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts exhibits a great dependence on excitation wavelength and crystalline orientation.








Abstract
2D inorganic bimolecular crystals, consisting of two different inorganic molecules, are expected to possess novel physical and chemical properties due to the synergistic effect of the individual components. However, 2D inorganic bimolecular crystals remain unexploited because of the difficulties in preparation arising from non&#8208;typical layered structures and intricate intermolecular interactions. Here, the synthesis of 2D inorganic bimolecular crystal SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts via a facile vertical microspacing sublimation strategy is reported. The as&#8208;synthesized SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts exhibit strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy of phonon vibrations and intramolecular vibrations as well as show anisotropic light absorption with a high dichroism ratio of 3.9. Furthermore, it is revealed that the second harmonic generation intensity of SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts is highly dependent on the excitation wavelength and crystallographic orientation. This work can inspire the growth of more 2D inorganic bimolecular crystals and excite potential applications for bimolecular optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Mechanically Robust, Elastic, and Healable Ionogels for Highly Sensitive Ultra&#8208;Durable Ionic Skins</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly sensitive ultra&#8208;durable ionic skins are fabricated by impregnating ionic liquids into a mechanically robust poly(urea&#8208;urethane) network. Even after being stored in open air for 200 days, the I&#8208;skins exhibit a highly reproducible electrical response over 10 000 uninterrupted strain cycles. The fractured I&#8208;skin can be easily healed to regain their original sensing performance.








Abstract
The fabrication of highly durable skin&#8208;mimicking sensors remains challenging because of the unavoidable fatigue and physical damage that sensors are subjected to in practical applications. In this study, ultra&#8208;durable ionic skins (I&#8208;skins) with excellent healability and high sensitivity are fabricated by impregnating ionic liquids (ILs) into a mechanically robust poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PU) network. The PU network is composed of crystallized poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and flexible poly(ethylene glycol) that are dynamically cross&#8208;linked with hindered urea bonds and hydrogen bonds. Such a design endows the resultant ionogels with high mechanical strength, good elasticity, Young's modulus similar to that of natural skin, and excellent healability. The ionogel&#8208;based I&#8208;skins exhibit a high sensitivity to a wide range of strains (0.1&#8211;300%) and pressures (0.1&#8211;20 kPa). Importantly, the I&#8208;skins show a highly reproducible electrical response over 10 000 uninterrupted strain cycles. The sensing performance of the I&#8208;skins stored in open air for 200 days is almost the same as that of the freshly prepared I&#8208;skin. The fractured I&#8208;skins can be easily healed by heating at 65 &#176;C that restores their original ultra&#8208;durable sensing performance. The long&#8208;term durability of the I&#8208;skins is attributed to the combination of non&#8208;volatility of the ILs, excellent healability, and well&#8208;designed mechanical properties.

      <title>Heterostructures Built in Metal Hydrides for Advanced Hydrogen Storage Reversibility</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile strategy to effectively improve the reversible hydrogen storage performance of Mg(BH4)2 is realized herein by building heterostructures uniformly inside MgH2 nanoparticles. MgH2 acts as a hydrogen pump, which changes the nature of the initial formation of B&#63743;H bonds from endothermic to exothermic process via breaking stable B&#8211;B bonds and hence thermodynamically improves the reversibility of Mg(BH4)2.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage is a vital technology for developing on&#8208;board hydrogen fuel cells. While Mg(BH4)2 is widely regarded as a promising hydrogen storage material owing to its extremely high gravimetric and volumetric capacity, its poor reversibility poses a major bottleneck inhibiting its practical applications. Herein, a facile strategy to effectively improve the reversible hydrogen storage performance of Mg(BH4)2 via building heterostructures uniformly inside MgH2 nanoparticles is reported. The in situ reaction between MgH2 nanoparticles and B2H6 not only forms homogeneous heterostructures with controllable particle size but also simultaneously decreases the particle size of the MgH2 nanoparticles inside, which effectively reduces the kinetic barrier that inhibits the reversible hydrogen storage in both Mg(BH4)2 and MgH2. More importantly, density functional theory coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics calculations clearly demonstrates that MgH2 in this heterostructure can act as a hydrogen pump, which drastically changes the enthalpy for the initial formation of B&#63743;H bonds by breaking stable B&#63743;B bonds from endothermic to exothermic and hence thermodynamically improves the reversibility of Mg(BH4)2. It is believed that building heterostructures provides a window of opportunity for discovering high&#8208;performance hydrogen storage materials for on&#8208;board applications.

      <title>Metal Atom&#8208;Doped Co3O4 Hierarchical Nanoplates for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal atom&#8208;doped Co3O4 hierarchical nanoplates constructed by ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized by a cooperative etching&#8722;coordination&#8722;reorganization approach. The method allows doping of 13 metal elements in total.

Abstract
Electrocatalysts based on hierarchically structured and heteroatom&#8208;doped non&#8208;noble metal oxide materials are of great importance for efficient and low&#8208;cost electrochemical water splitting systems. Herein, the synthesis of a series of hierarchical hollow nanoplates (NPs) composed of ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets doped with 13 different metal atoms is reported. The synthesis involves a cooperative etching&#8722;coordination&#8722;reorganization approach starting from zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) NPs. First, metal atom decorated ZIF&#8208;67 NPs with unique cross&#8208;channels are formed through a Lewis acid etching and metal species coordination process. Afterward, the composite NPs are converted to hollow Co3O4 hierarchical NPs composed of ultrathin nanosheets through a solvothermal reaction, during which the guest metal species is doped into the octahedral sites of Co3O4. Density functional theory calculations suggest that doping of small amount of Fe atoms near the surface of Co3O4 can greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained Fe&#8208;doped Co3O4 hierarchical NPs manifest superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec&#8722;1, and excellent stability even at a high current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for 50 h.

      <title>Robust Fabrication of Hybrid Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Pellets for Stable X&#8208;Ray Detectors with Low Detection Limit</title>
      <dc:description>
MA3Bi2I9 polycrystalline pellets (PPs) are fabricated by the robust, cost effective, and scalable cold isostatic&#8208;pressing approach, and X&#8208;ray detectors based on MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs reach a limit of detection (LoD) of 9.3 nGyair s&#8722;1. The low LoD of the X&#8208;ray detectors can obviously decrease the radiation dose used, thereby reducing health risks in medical diagnostics and security screening.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray detectors are widely utilized in medical diagnostics and nondestructive product inspection. Halide perovskites are recently demonstrated as excellent candidates for direct X&#8208;ray detection. However, it is still challenging to obtain high quality perovskites with millimeter&#8208;thick over a large area for high performance, stable X&#8208;ray detectors. Here, methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) polycrystalline pellets (PPs) are developed by a robust, cost effective, and scalable cold isostatic&#8208;pressing for fabricating X&#8208;ray detectors with low limit of detection (LoD) and superior operational stability. The MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs possess a high resistivity of 2.28 &#215; 1011 &#937; cm and low dark carrier concentration of &#8776;107 cm&#8722;3, and balanced mobility of &#8776;2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for electrons and holes. These merits enable a sensitivity of 563 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, a detection efficiency of 28.8%, and an LoD of 9.3 nGyair s&#8722;1 for MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs detectors, and the LoD is much lower than the dose rate required for X&#8208;ray diagnostics used currently (5.5 &#956;Gyair s&#8722;1). In addition, the MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs detectors work stably under high working bias field up to 2000 V cm&#8722;1 after sensing an integrated dose &gt;320 Gyair with continuous X&#8208;ray radiation, demonstrating its competitive advantage in practical application. These findings provide an approach to explore a new generation of low LoD, stable and green X&#8208;ray detectors based on MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs.

      <title>Perovskite Granular Wire Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Photodetectivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Perovskite granular wires synthesized by a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly exhibit superior photodetecting performance with unprecedentedly high photodetectivity, originating from a low dark current due to band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of the granular wires. The &#8220;self&#8208;assembled nanograin engineering&#8221; strategy provides a viable method for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite photodetectors and can be extended to other integrated optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
Control over the morphology and crystallinity of metal halide perovskite materials is of key importance to enable high&#8208;performance optoelectronics. Here, a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly synthesis of perovskite granular wires with ultrahigh photodetectivity (3.17 &#215; 1015 Jones) is reported. The 1D self&#8208;assembly of perovskite grains is driven by differences in the surface interaction energies of the granular facets. The superb photodetecting performance originates from extremely low dark current engendered by energetic barriers featuring unique band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of wire. Flexible photodetector arrays, fabricated by selectively placing perovskite granular wires onto pre&#8208;patterned electrode arrays on a transparent polymer substrate, show independently addressable photonic signal mapping with remarkably high detectivity, photoconductive gain, and responsivity. The &#8220;self&#8208;assembled nanograin engineering&#8221; strategy developed in this study provides a viable method for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite photodetectors and can be extended to other integrated optoelectronic systems.

      <title>Nonvolatile Electrically Reconfigurable Integrated Photonic Switch Enabled by a Silicon PIN Diode Heater</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonvolatile electrically reconfigurable photonic switches based on phase&#8208;change material&#8208;clad silicon waveguides and microring resonators are demonstrated via in situ silicon PIN diode heaters. Low&#8208;energy, compact, low&#8208;loss, low&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;cyclability operations at moderate speeds are obtained in a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;compatible process, promising very large&#8208;scale programmable electronic&#8211;photonic systems such as optical neural networks and general&#8208;purpose integrated photonic processors.








Abstract
Reconfigurability of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has become increasingly important due to the growing demands for electronic&#8211;photonic systems on a chip driven by emerging applications, including neuromorphic computing, quantum information, and microwave photonics. Success in these fields usually requires highly scalable photonic switching units as essential building blocks. Current photonic switches, however, mainly rely on materials with weak, volatile thermo&#8208;optic or electro&#8208;optic modulation effects, resulting in large footprints and high energy consumption. As a promising alternative, chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) exhibit strong optical modulation in a static, self&#8208;holding fashion, but the scalability of present PCM&#8208;integrated photonic applications is still limited by the poor optical or electrical actuation approaches. Here, with phase transitions actuated by in situ silicon PIN diode heaters, scalable nonvolatile electrically reconfigurable photonic switches using PCM&#8208;clad silicon waveguides and microring resonators are demonstrated. As a result, intrinsically compact and energy&#8208;efficient switching units operated with low driving voltages, near&#8208;zero additional loss, and reversible switching with high endurance are obtained in a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible process. This work can potentially enable very large&#8208;scale CMOS&#8208;integrated programmable electronic&#8211;photonic systems such as optical neural networks and general&#8208;purpose integrated photonic processors.

      <title>Boosting Neutral Water Oxidation through Surface Oxygen Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel design of efficient neutral oxygen evolution reaction catalyst is demonstrated by incorporating hydrated metal cations (Ca2+) into Ru&#8211;Ir binary oxide. The obtained Ru&#8211;Ir&#8211;Ca oxide catalyst on glassy carbon electrode achieves 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 250 mV, and its turnover frequency is about 2&#8208;, 7&#8208;, and 45&#8208;times higher than those of Ru&#8211;Ir oxide, RuO2, and IrO2 catalysts, respectively.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in pH&#8208;neutral electrolyte is crucial for microbial electrolysis cells and electrochemical CO2 reduction. Unfortunately, the OER kinetics in neutral electrolyte is sluggish due to the low concentration of adsorbed reactants, with overpotentials of neutral OER at present much higher than that in acidic or alkaline electrolyte. Here, hydrated metal cations (Ca2+) are sought to be incorporated into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8211;Ir binary oxide to tailor the surface oxygen environments (lattice&#8208;oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species) for efficient neutral OER. Using a sol&#8211;gel method, ternary Ru&#8211;Ir&#8211;Ca oxides are synthesized in atomically homogenous manner, and the obtained catalyst on glassy carbon electrode achieves 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 250 mV, with no degradation for 200 h of operation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ 18O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and 18O isotope&#8208;labeling secondary ion mass spectroscopy studies are carried out. The results reveal that incorporation of Ca2+ can enhance the covalency of metal&#8211;oxygen bonds and the electrophilic nature of surface metal&#8208;bonded oxygen sites; and simultaneously facilitate the adsorption of water molecules on catalyst surface, which accelerates the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;involved reaction, thus improving the overall OER performance of RuIrCaOx catalyst.

Abstract
Perovskites have been intensively investigated for their use in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research on their applications in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has drawn less attention despite their high intrinsic charge carrier mobility. In this study, the universal approaches for high&#8208;performance and reliable p&#8208;channel lead&#8208;free phenethylammonium tin iodide TFTs are reported. These include self&#8208;passivation for grain boundary by excess phenethylammonium iodide, grain crystallization control by adduct, and iodide vacancy passivation through oxygen treatment. It is found that the grain boundary passivation can increase TFT reproducibility and reliability, and the grain size enlargement can hike the TFT performance, thus, enabling the first perovskite&#8208;based complementary inverter demonstration with n&#8208;channel indium gallium zinc oxide TFTs. The inverter exhibits a high gain over 30 with an excellent noise margin. This work aims to provide widely applicable and repeatable methods to make the gate more open for intensive efforts toward high&#8208;performance printed perovskite TFTs.

&lt;p&gt;Perovskites have been intensively investigated for their use in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research on their applications in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has drawn less attention despite their high intrinsic charge carrier mobility. In this study, the universal approaches for high&#8208;performance and reliable p&#8208;channel lead&#8208;free phenethylammonium tin iodide TFTs are reported. These include self&#8208;passivation for grain boundary by excess phenethylammonium iodide, grain crystallization control by adduct, and iodide vacancy passivation through oxygen treatment. It is found that the grain boundary passivation can increase TFT reproducibility and reliability, and the grain size enlargement can hike the TFT performance, thus, enabling the first perovskite&#8208;based complementary inverter demonstration with n&#8208;channel indium gallium zinc oxide TFTs. The inverter exhibits a high gain over 30 with an excellent noise margin. This work aims to provide widely applicable and repeatable methods to make the gate more open for intensive efforts toward high&#8208;performance printed perovskite TFTs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Controlling Enamel Remineralization by Amyloid&#8208;Like Amelogenin Mimics</title>
      <dc:description>
The amyloid&#8208;like proteinaceous nanofilm entrapping peptide can mimic amelogenin matrix in nature, mediating the oriented array of amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles and their transformation to ordered enamel&#8208;like hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals. This technology can reproduce the growth of ordered HAp crystals, with the nearly identical mechanical strength to natural enamel, thus providing a promising strategy for treating dental caries.








Abstract
In situ regeneration of the enamel&#8208;like structure of hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals under oral conditions is significant for dental caries treatment. However, it is still a challenge for dentists to duplicate the elegant and well&#8208;aligned apatite structure bonding to the surface of demineralized enamel. A biocompatible amelogenin&#8208;inspired matrix, a phasetransited lysozyme (PTL) film mimicking an N&#8208;terminal amelogenin with central domain (N&#8208;Ame) combined with synthetic peptide (C&#8208;AMG) based on the functional domains of C&#8208;terminal telopeptide (C&#8208;Ame) is shown here, which is formed by amyloid&#8208;like lysozyme aggregation at the enamel interface through a rapid one&#8208;step aqueous coating process. In the PTL/C&#8208;AMG matrix, C&#8208;AMG facilitated the oriented arrangement of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanoparticles and their transformation to ordered enamel&#8208;like HAp crystals, while PTL served as a strong interfacial anchor to immobilize the C&#8208;AMG peptide and PTL/C&#8208;AMG matrix on versatile substrate surfaces. PTL/C&#8208;AMG film&#8208;coated enamel induced both of the in vivo and in vitro synthesis of HAp crystals, facilitated epitaxial growth of HAp crystals and recovered the highly oriented structure and mechanical properties to levels nearly identical to those of natural enamel. This work underlines the importance of amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregates in the biomineralization of enamel, providing a promising strategy for treating dental caries.
