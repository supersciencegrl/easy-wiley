         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced rGO Coatings for Highly Sensitive and Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in the PSA Gray Zone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on evaporation&#8208;induced wrinkled reduced graphene oxide coating can achieve highly sensitive and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) gray zone. Compared with the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA&#8208;based tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7%.








Abstract
The prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) has been widely used for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer during routine check&#8208;ups. However, the low sensitivity of regular PSA tests in the PSA gray zone often means that patients are required to undergo further invasive needle biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, which may lead to potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In this study, a circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on an evaporation&#8208;induced reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coating is presented, which enables a highly specific and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone. During the evaporation process of the rGO dispersion, the Marangoni effect induces the self&#8208;assembly of a hierarchical micro/nanowrinkled rGO coating, which can capture CTCs after subsequent surface modification of capture agents. Compared to the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based hematological tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7% in clinical trial. Therefore, this study provides a non&#8208;invasive alternative with high sensitivity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone.

         <title>A Micrometer&#8208;Sized Silicon/Carbon Composite Anode Synthesized by Impregnation of Petroleum Pitch in Nanoporous Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micrometer&#8208;sized silicon/carbon composite anode developed by facile and scalable impregnation of petroleum pitch that stabilizes nanoporous Si against sintering at high temperature is reported. The composite anode including single nanometer&#8208;sized primary particles shielded by pitch&#8208;derived carbon exhibits outstanding battery performance such as 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles in the full cell system.








Abstract
Porous silicon (Si)/carbon nanocomposites have been extensively explored as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, shrinking of the pores and sintering of Si in the nanoporous structure during fabrication often diminishes the full benefits of nanoporous Si. Herein, a scalable method is reported to preserve the porous Si nanostructure by impregnating petroleum pitch inside of porous Si before high&#8208;temperature treatment. The resulting micrometer&#8208;sized Si/C composite maintains a desired porosity to accommodate large volume change and high conductivity to facilitate charge transfer. It also forms a stable surface coating that limits the penetration of electrolyte into nanoporous Si and minimizes the side reaction between electrolyte and Si during cycling and storage. A Si&#8208;based anode with 80% of pitch&#8208;derived carbon/nanoporous Si enables very stable cycling of a Si||Li(Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3)O2 (NMC532) battery (80% capacity retention after 450 cycles). It also leads to low swelling in both particle and electrode levels required for the next generation of high&#8208;energy LIBs. The process also can be used to preserve the porous structure of other nanoporous materials that need to be treated at high temperatures.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Silica 3D Chiral Metamaterials via Helium&#8208;Assisted Microcasting Supporting Topologically Protected Twist Edge Resonances with High Mechanical Quality Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel helium&#8208;assisted microcasting approach is introduced to fabricate 3D fused&#8208;silica microstructures. For a 3D chiral fused&#8208;silica metamaterial beam, the existence of topologically protected twist&#8208;edge resonances with large mechanical quality factors of 2850 is demonstrated. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other materials, and to complex architectures that are not amenable to direct 3D laser printing.








Abstract
It is predicted theoretically that a 1D diatomic chain of 3D chiral cells can support a topological bandgap that allows for translating a small time&#8208;harmonic axial movement at one end of the chain into a resonantly enhanced large rotation of an edge state at the other end. This edge state is topologically protected such that an arbitrary mass of a mirror at the other end does not shift the eigenfrequency out of the bandgap. Herein, this complex 3D laser&#8208;beam&#8208;scanner microstructure is realized in fused&#8208;silica form. A novel microcasting approach is introduced that starts from a hollow polymer cast made by standard 3D laser nanoprinting. The cast is evacuated and filled with helium, such that a highly viscous commercial glass slurry is sucked in. After UV curing and thermal debinding of the polymer, the fused&#8208;silica glass is sintered at 1225&#160;&#176;C under vacuum. Detailed optical measurements reveal a mechanical quality factor of the twist&#8208;edge resonance of 2850 at around 278&#160;kHz resonance frequency under ambient conditions. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other glasses, to metals and ceramics, and to complex architectures that are not or not yet amenable to direct 3D laser printing.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Cooperative Transition in Molecular Electronic Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major challenge in supramolecular electronic crystal is switchable control of its hidden phase. The cooperative tuning of K&#8208;TCNQ through pulsed electromagnetic field into an emergent electronic disorder state, enabling the access to a long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) hidden conducting phase, is found. A switchable magneto&#8208;electronic bistability is realized in a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K.








Abstract
The competing and non&#8208;equilibrium phase transitions, involving dynamic tunability of cooperative electronic and magnetic states in strongly correlated materials, show great promise in quantum sensing and information technology. To date, the stabilization of transient states is still in the preliminary stage, particularly with respect to molecular electronic solids. Here, a dynamic and cooperative phase in potassium&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (K&#8208;TCNQ) with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation is demonstrated. Simultaneous dynamic and coherent lattice perturbation with 8 ns&#160;pulsed laser (532&#160;nm, 15 MW&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10 Hz)&#160;in such a molecular electronic crystal initiates a stable long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) conducting paramagnetic state (&#8776;42 &#937;cm), showing the charge&#8211;spin bistability over a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K. Comprehensive noise spectroscopy, in situ high&#8208;pressure measurements, electron spin resonance (ESR), theoretical model, and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies provide further evidence that such an transition is cooperative, requiring a dedicate charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling to activate and subsequently stabilize nonequilibrium phase. The cooperativity triggered by ultrahigh&#8208;strain&#8208;rate (above 106 s&#8722;1) pulsed excitation offers a collective control toward the generation and stabilization of strongly correlated electronic and magnetic orders in molecular electronic solids and offers unique electro&#8208;magnetic phases with technological promises.

The nexus between electronic quality factor and thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped GeTe, which can serve as a facile yet efficient descriptor for high&#8208;throughput screen of good thermoelectric materials, is explained. To clarify this point, Ta&#8208;doped GeTe is designed with optimized electronic quality factor, rendering a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit over 2.0 and a conceptional efficiency over 15%.








Abstract
Owing to high intrinsic figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit implemented by multi&#8208;band valleytronics, GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials are promising for medium&#8208;temperature applications. Transition metals are widely used as dopants for developing high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectric materials. Herein, relevant work is critically reviewed to establish a correlation among transition metal doping, electronic quality factor, and figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of GeTe. From first&#8208;principle calculations, it is found that Ta, as an undiscovered dopant in GeTe, can effectively converge energy offset between light and heavy conduction band extrema to enhance effective mass at high temperature. Such manipulation is verified by the increased Seebeck coefficient of synthesized Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe samples from 160 to 180 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 775 K upon doping Ta, then to 220 &#181;V K&#8722;1 with further alloying Sb. Characterization using electron microscopy also reveals the unique herringbone structure associated with multi&#8208;scale lattice defects induced by Ta doping, which greatly hinder phonon propagation to decrease thermal conductivity. As a result, a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of &#8776;2.0 is attained in the Ge0.88Ta0.02Sb0.10Te sample, reflecting a maximum heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity efficiency up to 17.7% under a temperature gradient of 400 K. The rationalized beneficial effects stemming from Ta doping is an important observation that will stimulate new exploration toward high&#8208;performance GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Ten Years of Progress in the Synthesis and Development of MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are among the largest 2D material families. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity, render them quite useful in a large number of applications including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. A brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, the number of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has steadily increased. Currently more than 40 MXene compositions exist. The ultimate number is far greater and in time they may develop into the largest family of 2D materials known. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity reaching &#8776;20&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1, render them quite useful in a large number of applications, including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. The number of MXene papers and patents published has been growing quickly. The first MXene generation is synthesized using selective etching of metal layers from the MAX phases, layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides using hydrofluoric acid. Since then, multiple synthesis approaches have been developed, including selective etching in a mixture of fluoride salts and various acids, non&#8208;aqueous etchants, halogens, and molten salts, allowing for the synthesis of new MXenes with better control over their surface chemistries. Herein, a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided. The fact that their production is readily scalable in aqueous environments, with high yields bodes well for their commercialization.

         <title>Photonic Bandgap in Achiral Liquid Crystals&#8212;A Twist on a Twist</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photonic bandgap phenomenon is observed in a liquid crystalline phase built of achiral molecules, in which a tendency to twist is caused by steric interactions between strongly bent molecules. A selective reflection of visible light appears due to unwinding of the helical structure at the transition between two smectic phases having a single&#8208; and double&#8208;helical structure.








Abstract
Achiral mesogenic molecules are shown to be able to spontaneously assemble into liquid crystalline smectic phases having either simple or double&#8208;helical structures. At the transition between these phases, the double&#8208;helical structure unwinds. As a consequence, in some temperature range, the pitch of the helix becomes comparable to the wavelength of visible light and the selective reflection of light in the visible range is observed. The photonic bandgap phenomenon is reported for achiral liquid crystals.

         <title>Large&#8208;Sized Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Increase DC&#8211;T&#8208;Cell Synaptic Contact and the Efficacy of DC Vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel material&#8208;based method of regulating dendritic cell (DC)&#8211;T&#8208;cell synaptic contact for adoptive DC vaccine engineering is reported. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets serve as a &#8220;nanozipper&#8221; or &#8220;double&#8208;sided tape&#8221; facilitating the formation and aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell immune synapses to elicit robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. Cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;positioning of intercellular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) might be the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are used for cancer and infectious diseases, albeit with limited efficacy. Modulating the formation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapses may greatly increase their efficacy. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on DCs and DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation are evaluated. In particular, size&#8208;dependent interactions are observed between GO nanosheets and DCs. GOs with diameters of &gt;1 &#181;m (L&#8208;GOs) demonstrate strong adherence to the DC surface, inducing cytoskeletal reorganization via the RhoA&#8208;ROCK&#8208;MLC pathway, while relatively small GOs (&#8776;500 nm) are predominantly internalized by DCs. Furthermore, L&#8208;GO treatment enhances DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation via cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane positioning of integrin ICAM&#8208;1. L&#8208;GO acts as a &#8220;nanozipper,&#8221; facilitating the aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L&#8208;GO&#8208;adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike 1, leading to &gt;99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strain. These findings highlight the potential value of nanomaterials as DC vaccine adjuvants for modulating DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation and provide a basis for the development of effective COVID&#8208;19 vaccines.

         <title>Improving the Stability of Non&#8208;Noble&#8208;Metal M&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells through M&#8211;N Bond Length and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy is developed to improve the stability of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in half&#8208;cell and H2&#8211;O2/air fuel cells by accurately regulating the M&#63743;N bond length/coordination. Interestingly, the Fe&#63743;N bond length/coordination of the catalysts are strongly dependent on the binding constant of Fe3+ and polymer in the precursors, which can be linked with their performance degradation in fuel cells.








Abstract
An effective and universal strategy is developed to enhance the stability of the non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal M&#8211;Nx/C catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) by improving the bonding strength between metal ions and chelating polymers, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) homopolymer and poly(acrylic acid&#8211;maleic acid) (P(AA&#8208;MA)) copolymer with different AA/MA ratios. M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that the optimal P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst with a higher Fe3+&#8211;polymer binding constant possesses longer Fe&#63743;N bonds and exclusive Fe&#8211;N4/C moiety compared to PAA&#8211;Fe&#8211;N, which consists of &#8776;15% low&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8211;N2/N3 structures. The optimized P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both half&#8208;cell and PEMFC cathodes, with the retention rate of current density approaching 100% for the first 37 h at 0.55&#160;V in an H2&#8211;air fuel cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Fe&#8211;N4/C site could optimize the difference between the adsorption energy of the Fe atoms on the support (Ead) and the bulk cohesive energy (Ecoh) relative to Fe&#8211;N2/N3 moieties, thereby strongly stabilizing Fe centers against demetalation.

Interestingly, the Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N bond length/coordination of the catalysts are strongly dependent on the binding constant of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and polymer in the precursors, which can be linked with their performance degradation in fuel cells.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective and universal strategy is developed to enhance the stability of the non-noble-metal M&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/C catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) by improving the bonding strength between metal ions and chelating polymers, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) homopolymer and poly(acrylic acid&#8211;maleic acid) (P(AA-MA)) copolymer with different AA/MA ratios. M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that the optimal P(AA-MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst with a higher Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;polymer binding constant possesses longer Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N bonds and exclusive Fe&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C moiety compared to PAA&#8211;Fe&#8211;N, which consists of &#8776;15% low-coordinated Fe&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structures. The optimized P(AA-MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both half-cell and PEMFC cathodes, with the retention rate of current density approaching 100% for the first 37 h at 0.55&#160;V in an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;air fuel cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Fe&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C site could optimize the difference between the adsorption energy of the Fe atoms on the support (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) and the bulk cohesive energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;coh&lt;/sub&gt;) relative to Fe&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moieties, thereby strongly stabilizing Fe centers against demetalation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cactus&#8208;Spine&#8208;Inspired Sweat&#8208;Collecting Patch for Fast and Continuous Monitoring of Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sweat&#8208;collecting patch with high sweat&#8208;collection efficiency is developed. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels, which induce a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area spontaneously without leaving it inside the channel. A sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of biochemical changes in sweat.








Abstract
A sweat sensor is expected to be the most appropriate wearable device for noninvasive healthcare monitoring. However, the practical use of sweat sensors is impeded by irregular and low sweat secretion rates. Here, a sweat&#8208;collecting patch that can collect sweat efficiently for fast and continuous healthcare monitoring is demonstrated. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels on a hierarchical microstructured/nanostructured surface. The channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing area spontaneously even when the patch is aligned vertically. The patch demonstrates superior sweat&#8208;collecting efficiency and reduces the time required to fill the sensing area by transporting sweat almost without leaving it inside the channel. Therefore, a sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat, and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of changes in sweat biochemicals according to their changes in the wearer's blood.

         <title>An Engineered Pseudo&#8208;Macrophage for Rapid Treatment of Bacteria&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis via Microwave&#8208;Excited Anti&#8208;Infection and Immunoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophage M&#8208;Fe3O4/Au therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) that can be locally accumulated at infection sites through double targeting of proteins and magnets and that can mitigate the inflammatory response by immunoregulation through an electromagnetic field produced by microwave (MW) irradiation and neutralizing inflammatory cytokine, are developed; the Fe3O4/Au NPs can generate O2&#8722; and heat by MW assistance.








Abstract
Preventing deep bacterial infection and simultaneously enhancing osteogenic differentiation are in great demand for osteomyelitis. Microwave (MW) dynamic therapy is attracting attention due to its excellent penetration ability, but the mechanism of MW&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) is still unknown. Herein, MW&#8208;responsive engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophages (M&#8208;Fe3O4/Au nanoparticles (NPs)) are fabricated to clear Staphylococcus aureus infections and induce M2 polarization of macrophages to improve osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under MW irradiation. Fe3O4/Au NPs can generate &#183;O2&#8722; and heat under MW irradiation in a saline solution, and the mechanism is put forward via finite element modeling and density functional theory calculations. Due to the gap plasmon, electromagnetic hotspots are produced at Fe3O4&#8211;Au interface at 2.45&#160;GHz. Because of these induced electromagnetic hotspots, the sodium species is field&#8208;ionized and subsequently reacts with oxygen to produce &#183;O2&#8722;. Meanwhile, the Fe3O4/Au NPs have a stronger ability than Fe3O4 NPs to fix oxygen, favoring the production of ROS. Additionally, MW&#8208;treated macrophages diminish to secrete inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the decrease of ROS production in MSCs and thus enhancing their osteogenic differentiation. These engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophages will be promising for effectively treating bacterial infections and promoting osteoblast differentiation simultaneously in deep tissues under MW irradiation.

         <title>3D Printing of Elastomeric Bioinspired Complex Adhesive Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printing&#8208;based fabrication approach is utilized for creating complex elastomeric microstructural adhesives directly. Two hybrid bioinspired structure designs are demonstrated, combining the strengths of gecko&#8208;inspired microfiber adhesives with springtail&#8208; and octopus&#8208;inspired microstructures to enable complex adhesives toward various real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Bioinspired elastomeric structural adhesives can provide reversible and controllable adhesion on dry/wet and synthetic/biological surfaces for a broad range of commercial applications. Shape complexity and performance of the existing structural adhesives are limited by the used specific fabrication technique, such as molding. To overcome these limitations by proposing complex 3D microstructured adhesive designs, a 3D elastomeric microstructure fabrication approach is implemented using two&#8208;photon&#8208;polymerization&#8208;based 3D printing. A custom aliphatic urethane&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based elastomer is used as the 3D printing material. Two designs are demonstrated with two combined biological inspirations to show the advanced capabilities enabled by the proposed fabrication approach and custom elastomer. The first design focuses on springtail&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid microfiber adhesive, which has the multifunctionalities of side&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, top&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, and strong reversible adhesion features in a single fiber array. The second design primarily centers on octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid adhesive, which exhibits the benefits of both octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired microstructured adhesives for strong reversible adhesion on both wet and dry surfaces, such as skin. This fabrication approach could be used to produce many other 3D complex elastomeric structural adhesives for future real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Hollow InVO4 Nanocuboid Assemblies toward Promoting Photocatalytic N2 Conversion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The InVO4 superstructure with cubical skeleton and hollow interior is synthesized. The closely ordered assembly of nanocuboids improves the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs through promoted charge transfer among neighboring building blocks. This promising charge mobility feature contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of InVO4 superstrucure toward N2 fixation into NH3.








Abstract
The unique InVO4 mesocrystal superstructure, particularly with cubical skeleton and hollow interior, which consists of numerous nanocube building blocks, closely stacking by stacking, aligning by aligning, and sharing the same crystallographic orientations, is successfully fabricated. The synergy of a reaction&#8208;limited aggregation and an Ostwald ripening process is reasonably proposed for the growth of this unique superstructure. Both single&#8208;particle surface photovoltage and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the long&#8208;range ordered mesocrystal superstructures can significantly retard the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs through the creation of a new pathway for anisotropic electron flow along the inter&#8208;nanocubes. This promising charge mobility feature of the superstructure greatly contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of the InVO4 mesocrystal toward fixation of N2 into NH3 with the quantum yield of 0.50% at wavelength of 385&#160;nm.

         <title>3D Temporary&#8208;Magnetized Soft Robotic Structures for Enhanced Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mechanically guided, compressive&#8208;buckling process, a set of judiciously engineered 3D soft robotic structures can be developed based on magnetic materials. Under the precise control of the external magnetic&#8208;field, the temporary&#8208;magnetized 3D structures can achieve various tethered locomotion. Further integration with functional devices (piezoelectric energy harvester, solar cell) allows for enhanced energy harvesting, and potentially multimodal sensing and robotic interfaces.








Abstract
The advent of functional materials offers tremendous potential in a broad variety of areas such as electronics, robotics, and energy devices. Magnetic materials are an attractive candidate that enable multifunctional devices with capabilities in both sensing and actuation. However, current magnetic devices, especially those with complex motion modalities, rely on permanently magnetized materials with complicated, non&#8208;uniform magnetization profiles. Here, based on magnetic materials with temporary&#8208;magnetization, a mechanically guided assembly process successfully converts laser&#8208;patterned 2D magnetic materials into judiciously engineered 3D structures, with dimensions and geometries ranging from mesoscale 3D filaments, to arrayed centimeter&#8208;scale 3D membranes. With tailorable mechanical properties and highly adjustable geometries, 3D soft structures can exhibit various tethered locomotions under the precise control of magnetic fields, including local deformation, unidirectional tilting, and omnidirectional rotation, and can serve as dynamic surfaces for further integration with other functional materials or devices. Examples demonstrated here focus on energy&#8208;harvesting systems, including 3D piezoelectric devices for noncontact conversion of mechanical energy and active motion sensing, as well as 3D solar tracking systems. The design strategy and resulting magnetic&#8208;controlled 3D soft structures hold great promise not only for enhanced energy harvesting, but also for multimodal sensing, robotic interfaces, and biomedical devices.

         <title>Membrane Materials for Selective Ion Separations at the Water&#8211;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging water and energy technologies often require membranes that selectively separate an ion from similar species. Progress in enhancing selective ion transport in polymeric membranes is described, followed by analysis of three advanced material classes that are possible candidates for ion&#8208;selective membranes owing to their molecular&#8208;level control over physicochemical properties. Research directions and challenges for developing ion&#8208;selective membranes are discussed.








Abstract
Synthetic polymer membranes are enabling components in key technologies at the water&#8211;energy nexus, including desalination and energy conversion, because of their high water/salt selectivity or ionic conductivity. However, many applications at the water&#8211;energy nexus require ion selectivity, or separation of specific ionic species from other similar species. Here, the ion selectivity of conventional polymeric membrane materials is assessed and recent progress in enhancing selective transport via tailored free volume elements and ion&#8211;membrane interactions is described. In view of the limitations of polymeric membranes, three material classes&#8212;porous crystalline materials, 2D materials, and discrete biomimetic channels&#8212;are highlighted as possible candidates for ion&#8208;selective membranes owing to their molecular&#8208;level control over physical and chemical properties. Lastly, research directions and critical challenges for developing bioinspired membranes with molecular recognition are provided.

         <title>Exceptionally High Blocking Temperature of 17 K in a Surface&#8208;Supported Molecular Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerene single&#8208;molecule magnets are prepared on a graphene monolayer by electrospray deposition. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) are among the most promising building blocks for future magnetic data storage or quantum computing applications, owing to magnetic bistability and long magnetic relaxation times. The practical device integration requires realization of 2D surface assemblies of SMMs, where each magnetic unit shows magnetic relaxation being sufficiently slow at application&#8208;relevant temperatures. Using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism, it is shown that sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerenes prepared on graphene by electrospray deposition exhibit magnetic behavior fully comparable to that of the bulk. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk sample but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet. The reported findings give a boost to the efforts to stabilize and address the spin degree of freedom in molecular magnets aiming at the realization of SMM&#8208;based spintronic units.

         <title>Short Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes Mediate Charge&#8208;Recombination Losses in Organic Solar Cell Blends with Low Charge&#8208;Transfer Driving Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells that employ donor:acceptor blends with near&#8208;zero driving force for charge transfer are becoming prevalent because of their superior performance. In this work, the factors affecting charge transfer and subsequent dissociation of the charge&#8208;transfer state are experimentally and theoretically analyzed. Short excited&#8208;state lifetime and hybridization open up new recombination channels with detrimental effects on free&#8208;charge generation.








Abstract
A blend of a low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer and a fullerene derivative, with near&#8208;zero driving force for electron transfer, is investigated. Using femtosecond transient absorption and electroabsorption spectroscopy, the charge transfer (CT) and recombination dynamics as well as the early&#8208;time transport are quantified. Electron transfer is ultrafast, consistent with a Marcus&#8211;Levich&#8211;Jortner description. However, significant charge recombination and unusually short excited (S1) and CT state lifetimes (&#8776;14&#160;ps) are observed. At low S1&#8211;CT offset, a short S1 lifetime mediates charge recombination because: i) back&#8208;transfer from the CT to the S1 state followed by S1 recombination occurs and ii) additional S1&#8211;CT hybridization decreases the CT lifetime. Both effects are confirmed by density functional theory calculations. In addition, relatively slow (tens of picoseconds) dissociation of charges from the CT state is observed, due to low local charge mobility. Simulations using a four&#8208;state kinetic model entailing the effects of energetic disorder reveal that the free charge yield can be increased from the observed 12% to 60% by increasing the S1 and CT lifetimes to 150&#160;ps. Alternatively, decreasing the interfacial CT state disorder while increasing bulk disorder of free charges enhances the yield to 65% in spite of the short lifetimes.

         <title>Promoting Energy Transfer via Manipulation of Crystallization Kinetics of Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites for Efficient Green Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and more efficient energy transfer is realized in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The origin is found to be the manipulation of the crystallization kinetics, where the addition of potassium restricts the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the growth of low&#8208;n phases, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of 18.15%.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising materials applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their high exciton binding energy and quantum confinement effects. However, Q&#8208;2D perovskites feature a multiphase structure with abundant grain boundaries and interfaces, leading to nonradiative loss during the energy&#8208;transfer process. Here, a more efficient energy transfer in Q&#8208;2D perovskites is achieved by manipulating the crystallization kinetics of different&#8208;n phases. A series of alkali&#8208;metal bromides is utilized to manipulate the nucleation and growth of Q&#8208;2D perovskites, which is likely associated with the Coulomb interaction between alkali&#8208;metal ions and the negatively charged PbBr64&#8211; frames. The incorporation of K+ is found to restrict the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the subsequent growth of low&#8208;n phases, contributing to a spatially more homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and promoted energy transfer. As a result, highly efficient green Q&#8208;2D perovskites LEDs with a champion EQE of 18.15% and a maximum brightness of 25 800&#160;cd m&#8211;2 are achieved. The findings affirm a novel method to optimize the performance of Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs.

&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; frames. The incorporation of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is found to restrict the nucleation of high-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; phases and allows the subsequent growth of low-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; phases, contributing to a spatially more homogeneous distribution of different-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; phases and promoted energy transfer. As a result, highly efficient green Q-2D perovskites LEDs with a champion EQE of 18.15% and a maximum brightness of 25 800&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved. The findings affirm a novel method to optimize the performance of Q-2D perovskite LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Highly Compressible and Stretchable Carbon Spring for Smart Vibration and Magnetism Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous spring&#8208;like all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% is obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is designed. The excellent mechanical performance combined with the intrinsic advantages of carbon makes it a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors that can work at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Porous carbon materials demonstrate extensive applications for their attractive characteristics. Mechanical flexibility is an essential property guaranteeing their durability. After decades of research efforts, compressive brittleness of porous carbon materials is well resolved. However, reversible stretchability remains challenging to achieve due to the intrinsically weak connections and fragile joints of the porous carbon networks. Herein, it is presented that a porous all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% can be obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is introduced. Impressively, the porous all&#8208;carbon material can maintain reliable structural robustness and durability under loading condition of cyclic compressing&#8211;stretching process, similar to a real metallic spring. The unique performance renders it as a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors, even capable of operating at extreme temperatures. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights for creating highly stretchable and compressible porous materials from other neat inorganic components for diverse applications in future.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Nonfouling Zwitterionic Triple&#8208;Network Hydrogel in Saline Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties in saline environments, important for biomedical and engineering applications, by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network hydrogel. Strong chain entanglement and electrostatic interactions provide effective energy dissipation to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Zwitterionic hydrogels have received great attention due to their excellent nonfouling and biocompatible properties, but they suffer from weak mechanical strength in the saline environments important for biomedical and engineering applications due to the &#8220;anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte&#8221; effect. Conventional strategies to introduce hydrophobic or non&#8208;zwitterionic components to increase mechanical strength compromise their nonfouling properties. Here, a highly effective strategy is reported to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network (ZTN) hydrogel. The strong electrostatic interaction and network entanglement within the triple&#8208;network structure can effectively dissipate energy to toughen the hydrogel and achieve high strength, toughness, and stiffness in saline environments (compressive fracture stress 18.2 &#177; 1.4&#160;MPa,&#160;toughness 1.62 &#177; 0.03&#160;MJ m&#8211;3,&#160;and modulus 0.66 &#177; 0.03&#160;MPa&#160;in seawater environments). Moreover, the ZTN hydrogel is shown to strongly resist the attachment of proteins, bacteria, and cells. The results provide a fundamental understanding to guide the design of tough nonfouling zwitterionic hydrogels for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Engineering Endogenous Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage&#8208;Targeted Biomimetic Nano&#8208;RBC to Reprogram Tumor Immunosuppressive Microenvironment for Enhanced Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system is engineered via self&#8208;assembly of a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. The doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;RBC (V(Hb)@DOX) can innately target to decrease the number of immunosuppressive TAMs. Moreover, the O2 released from nano&#8208;RBC relieves tumor hypoxia, which further reprograms the immunosuppressive state to stimulate antitumor responses. The synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy effectively suppresses tumor growth, inhibits metastasis, and prevents autologous tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has shown encouraging results in various cancers, but the response rates are relatively low due to the complex tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor hypoxia correlates significantly with potent immunosuppressive activity. Here, a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate self&#8208;assembled biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system (V(Hb)) is engineered to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) and oxygen for reprogramming TIME. The Hb moiety of V(Hb)@DOX can bind to endogenous plasma haptoglobin (Hp) and specifically target the M2&#8208;type TAMs via the CD163 surface receptor, and effectively kill the cells. In addition, the O2 released by the Hb alleviates tumor hypoxia, which further augments the antitumor immune response by recruiting fewer M2&#8208;type macrophages. TAM&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the TIME, which concurrently downregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression of tumor cells, decrease the levels of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL&#8208;10 and TGF&#8208;&#946;, elevate the immunostimulatory IFN&#8208;&#947;, enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, and boost a strong memory response. The ensuing TAM&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence. Taken together, the engineered endogenous TAM&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano&#8208;RBC system is a highly promising tool to reprogram TIME for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Halide Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Ion Transport Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realization of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites transistors is challenging due to the presence of mobile ions. A generic strategy is demonstrated that can be applied for regulating ions in mixed ionic&#8211;electronic semiconductors and that enables the demonstration of perovskite transistors working at room&#8208;temperature by fixation of the mobile ions through ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials for applications in photovoltaic solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the presence of mobile ions in the material hinders the development of perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) due to screening of the gate potential in the nearby perovskite channel, and the resulting impediment to achieving gate modulation of an electronic current at room temperature. Here, room&#8208;temperature operation is demonstrated in cesium lead tribromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite&#8208;based FETs using an auxiliary ferroelectric gate of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)], to electrostatically fixate the mobile ions. The large interfacial polarization of the ferroelectric gate attracts the mobile ions away from the main nonferroelectric gate interface, thereby enabling modulation of the electronic current through the channel by the main gate. This strategy allows for realization of the p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 channel and revealing the thermally activated nature of the hole charge transport. The proposed strategy is generic and can be applied for regulating ions in a variety of ionic&#8211;electronic mixed semiconductors.

An ultrathin and ultrasensitive direct X&#8208;ray detector based on a heterojunction phototransistor is developed by taking advantage of high&#8208;gain and gating&#8208;modulation mechanisms. This unique device concept allows for a significant reduction in X&#8208;ray photoconductor thickness while maintaining high sensitivity and low detection limit, which opens up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;resolution, flexible, and low&#8208;cost X&#8208;ray direct detectors.








Abstract
Most contemporary X&#8208;ray detectors adopt device structures with non/low&#8208;gain energy conversion, such that a fairly thick X&#8208;ray photoconductor or scintillator is required to generate sufficient X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced charges, and thus numerous merits for thin devices, such as mechanical flexibility and high spatial resolution, have to be compromised. This dilemma is overcome by adopting a new high&#8208;gain device concept of a heterojunction X&#8208;ray phototransistor. In contrast to conventional detectors, X&#8208;ray phototransistors allow both electrical gating and photodoping for effective carrier&#8208;density modulation, leading to high photoconductive gain and low noise. As a result, ultrahigh sensitivities of over 105&#160;&#956;C Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 with low detection limit are achieved by just using an &#8776;50 nm thin photoconductor. The employment of ultrathin photoconductors also endows the detectors with superior flexibility and high imaging resolution. This concept offers great promise in realizing well&#8208;balanced detection performance, mechanical flexibility, integration, and cost for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Unveiling the Stabilities of Nickel&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathodes at an Identical Degree of Delithiation in Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>

Distinctive insights into the stabilities of the LiNi1&#8722;x&#8211;yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) cathode family on the basis of the degrees of delithiation are reported. It is revealed that NMC cathodes with higher Ni content may suggest better overall stabilities under an identical degree of delithiation, which contrasts with the common belief that NMC cathodes with higher Ni contents have inherently reduced stabilities.








Abstract
Bulk, surface, and interfacial instabilities that impact the cycle and thermal performances are the major challenges with high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LiNi1&#8722;x&#8211;yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) cathodes with high nickel contents. It is generally believed that the instabilities and performance losses become exponentially aggravated as the nickel content increases. Disparate from this prevailing belief, it is herein demonstrated that NMC cathodes with higher Ni contents may imply better overall stability than &#8220;lower&#8208;Ni&#8221; cathodes under an identical degree of delithiation (charging) conditions. With two representative cathodes, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiNiO2, a systematic investigation into their stabilities with control of the degree of delithiation is presented. Electrochemical tests indicate that LiNiO2 displays better cyclability than LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 at the same delithiation state. Comprehensive structural and interphase investigations unveil that the inferior cyclability of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 predominantly results from aggravated parasitic reactions, and the interphase stability may be more critical than lattice stability in dictating cyclability. Also, LiNiO2 delivers similar or better thermal behavior than LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2. The findings demonstrate a strong correlation of the stability of NMC cathodes to the degree of delithiation state rather than the Ni content itself, highlighting the importance of reassessing the true implications of Ni content and structural and interphasial tuning on the stabilities of NMC cathodes.

         <title>Organic Non&#8208;Wettable Superhydrophobic Fullerite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solubility and wettability of solids signify their interaction with liquids. The findings on fullerites&#8212;the only soluble form of pure carbon&#8212;are presented. It is demonstrated that solution&#8208;cast fullerite films developed from colloidal gels generate a non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic surface. They can be used directly in a plethora of practical applications requiring ultra&#8208;hydrophobicity and underwater photochemical applications.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing quest in material science has been the development of non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic films based on a single organic material, without the requirement of fluorination or silane treatment. Here, such films and coatings, which are developed using colloidal gels of fullerite C60 and C70 nanocrystals, are described. It is illustrated that despite the high surface energy of these van der Waals molecular crystals their gelation can create films having self&#8208;affine fractal surfaces with multiscale roughness. Water droplets on resulting surfaces of fullerite films bead like a pearl resting in a Fakir state with contact angle exceeding 150&#176;. The films are extremely water repellent and non&#8208;wettable; when submerged in water they stay dry up to 3 h even at a water depth of two feet and exhibit the plastron effect. A series of experiments are presented to provide comprehensive inspection of water droplet dynamics on these films. These include rolling, bouncing, squeezing, freezing, melting, evaporating; along with acidic and alkaline tests. Non&#8208;wettable films of such materials are unique as fullerites get photosensitized instantaneously generating extremely high yields (&#8776;100%) of singlet oxygen (1O2) that can destroy viruses and bacteria; thereby enabling their use in rheology, water purification, and medicinal devices.

         <title>An Intrinsically Micro&#8208;/Nanostructured Pollen Substrate with Tunable Optical Properties for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally abundant, spiky pollen grains provide a versatile building block to fabricate flexible, photonically active substrates by taking advantage of intrinsic micro&#8208;/nanostructural properties that influence light&#8211;matter interactions. A pollen substrate can exhibit high transparency and haze in a tunable manner, and such capabilities can be readily utilized to incorporate pollen substrates into solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
There is broad interest in developing photonically active substrates from naturally abundant, minimally processed materials that can help to overcome the environmental challenges of synthetic plastic substrates while also gaining inspiration from biological design principles. To date, most efforts have focused on rationally engineering the micro&#8208; and nanoscale structural properties of cellulose&#8208;based materials by tuning fibril and fiber dimensions and packing along with chemical modifications, while there is largely untapped potential to design photonically active substrates from other classes of natural materials with distinct morphological features. Herein, the fabrication of a flexible pollen&#8208;derived substrate is reported, which exhibits high transparency (&gt;92%) and high haze (&gt;84%) on account of the micro&#8208; and nanostructure properties of constituent pollen particles that are readily obtained from nature and require minimal extraction or processing to form the paper&#8208;like substrate based on colloidal self&#8208;assembly. Experiments and simulations confirm that the optical properties of the pollen substrate are tunable and arise from light&#8211;matter interactions with the spiky surface of pollen particles. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example, the pollen substrate is incorporated into a functional perovskite solar cell while the tunable optical properties of the intrinsically micro&#8208;/nanostructured pollen substrate can be useful for a wide range of optoelectronic applications.

A novel one&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase method is introduced to synthesize sulfide electrolyte from oxides in ambient air, making the synthesis process air&#8208;stable and glovebox&#8208;free. The as&#8208;synthesized Li3.875Sn0.875As0.125S4 possesses the highest ionic conductivity among all reported moist&#8208;air&#8208;stable sulfides, promoting potential mass production of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high reversible capacity (188.4 mAh g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (210 cycles).








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) are recognized as one of the most promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), due to their superior ionic conductivity and remarkable&#160;ductility. However, poor air stability, complex synthesis process, low yield, and high production cost obstruct the large&#8208;scale application of sulfide SEs. Herein, a one&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase synthesis method for sulfide SEs with oxide raw materials in ambient air, completely getting rid of the glovebox and thus making large&#8208;scale production possible, is reported. By adjusting substituted elements and concentrations, the ionic conductivity of Li4&#8208;xSn1&#8208;xMxS4 can reach 2.45&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1, which represents the highest value among all reported moist&#8208;air&#8208;stable and recoverable lithium&#8208;ion sulfide SEs reported. Furthermore, ASSBs with air/water&#8208;exposed and moderate&#8208;temperature&#8208;treated Li3.875Sn0.875As0.125S4 even maintains superior performances with the highest reversible capacity (188.4 mAh g&#8722;1) and the longest cycle life (210&#160;cycles), which also breaks the record. Therefore, it may become one of the most critical breakthroughs during the development of sulfide ASSBs toward its practical application and commercialization.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction for 2D Materials: Application in Noble Metal/TiB2 Heterointerfaces and their Enhanced Catalytic Performance for Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) between noble metal nanoparticles and TiB2 is directly observed. The resulting catalysts are not only sintering&#8208;resistant up to 800 &#176;C, but also highly efficient for formic acid dehydrogenation. Theoretical studies suggest that the TiB2 overlayers are stabilized on different transition metals through an interplay between covalent and electrostatic interactions.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) is a phenomenon commonly observed on heterogeneous catalysts. Here, direct evidence of SMSI between noble metal and 2D TiB2 supports is reported. The temperature&#8208;induced TiB2 overlayers encapsulate the metal nanoparticles, resulting in core&#8211;shell nanostructures that are sintering&#8208;resistant with metal loadings as high as 12.0 wt%. The TiOx&#8208;terminated TiB2 surfaces are the active sites catalyzing the dehydrogenation of formic acid at room temperature. In contrast to the trade&#8208;off between stability and activity in conventional SMSI, TiB2&#8208;based SMSI promotes catalytic activity and stability simultaneously. By optimizing the thickness and coverage of the overlayer, the Pt/TiB2 catalyst displays an outstanding hydrogen productivity of 13.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1cat h&#8722;1 in 10.0 m aqueous solution without any additive or pH adjustment, with &gt;99.9%&#160;selectivity toward CO2 and H2. Theoretical studies suggest that the TiB2 overlayers are stabilized on different transition metals through an interplay between covalent and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the computationally determined trends in metal&#8211;TiB2 interactions are fully consistent with the experimental observations regarding the extent of SMSI on different transition metals. The present research introduces a new means to create thermally stable and catalytically active metal/support interfaces for scalable chemical and energy applications.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary Engineering of Monolayer MoS2 for Energy&#8208;Efficient Lateral Synaptic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With lithography&#8208;free, direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing&#8208;controlled MoS2/MoS2&#8722;xO&#948; grain boundaries, synaptic devices exhibit short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity characteristics that are responsive to electric and light stimulation simultaneously, as well as low energy consumption that is over 40 times lower than that of conventional complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) devices.








Abstract
Synaptic devices based on 2D&#8208;layered materials have emerged as high&#8208;efficiency electronic synapses and neurons for neuromorphic computing. Lateral 2D synaptic devices have the advantages of multiple functionalities by responding to diverse stimuli, but they consume large amounts of energy, far more than the human brain. Moreover, current lateral devices employ several mechanisms based on conductive filaments and grain boundaries (GBs), but their formation is random and difficult to control, also hindering their practical applications. Here, four&#8208;terminal, lateral synaptic devices with artificially engineered GBs are reported, which are made from monolayer MoS2. With lithography&#8208;free, direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing&#8208;controlled MoS2/MoS2&#8722;xO&#948; GBs, such synaptic devices exhibit short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity characteristics that are responsive to electric and light stimulation simultaneously. This enables detailed simulations of biological learning and cognitive processes as well as image perception and processing. In particular, the device exhibits low energy consumption, similar to that of the human brain and much lower than those of other lateral 2D synaptic devices. This work provides an effective way to fabricate lateral synaptic devices for practical application development and sheds light on controllable electrical state switching for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>An Innovative Solvent&#8208;Responsive Coiling&#8211;Expanding Stent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellulose&#8208;based vascular stent, which can realize self&#8208;expansion for supporting vessels by blood, is constructed. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of the as&#8208;prepared stent are systemically investigated. In addition, theoretical modeling for the as&#8208;prepared stent is conducted. The results reveal that the achieved vascular stent can make outstanding contributions in the tissue engineering.








Abstract
Coronary artery disease is the &#8220;first killer&#8221; in the world, while the classical treatment for this disease is to implant stent. An ideal vascular stent should be nontoxic with self&#8208;expanding characteristics, quick expanding speed, and appropriate mechanical supporting property. However, no existing vascular stent covers all properties. Herein, a two&#8208;way shape&#8208;memory cellulose vascular stent, which can realize shape adjustments by mild solutions such as water and alcohol, is constructed. The shape&#8208;memory characteristics, mechanical properties, cell toxicity, and biocompatibility, are systemically investigated by ex vivo experiment as well as molecule simulation and theoretical modeling, revealing that the achieved bilayer two&#8208;way shape&#8208;memory films (BSMFs) can be used as an artificial vascular stent. In particular, this vascular stent made from BSMFs shows superb biocompatibility according to live/dead cell viability assays. Ex vivo experiments reveal that the novel vascular stent can support arteria coronaria sinistra, or the left main coronary artery, at the opening state while the cross&#8208;section of the vessel becomes two times larger than that of the initial state after implantation. Thus, it is believed that effective and scalable BSMFs can make meritorious fundamental contributions to biomaterials science and practical applications such as vascular stents.

         <title>Nanoscale Noncollinear Spin Textures in Thin Films of a D2d Heusler Compound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncollinear magnetic nano&#8208;objects are observed in epitaxial thin films of the D2d Heusler compound Mn2RhSn using magnetic force microscopy. The nano&#8208;objects are stabilized over a wide temperature&#8208;field region and can be deleted or created by local magnetic fields, thereby paving a path toward the realization of skyrmionic devices based on D2d Heusler thin films.








Abstract
Magnetic nano&#8208;objects, namely antiskyrmions and Bloch skyrmions, have been found to coexist in single&#8208;crystalline lamellae formed from bulk crystals of inverse tetragonal Heusler compounds with D2d symmetry. Here evidence is shown for magnetic nano&#8208;objects in epitaxial thin films of Mn2RhSn formed by magnetron sputtering. These nano&#8208;objects exhibit a wide range of sizes with stability with respect to magnetic field and temperature that is similar to single&#8208;crystalline lamellae. However, the nano&#8208;objects do not form well&#8208;defined arrays, nor is any evidence found for helical spin textures. This is speculated to likely be a consequence of the poorer homogeneity of chemical ordering in the thin films. However, evidence is found for elliptically distorted nano&#8208;objects along perpendicular crystallographic directions within the epitaxial films, which is consistent with elliptical Bloch skyrmions observed in single&#8208;crystalline lamellae. Thus, these measurements provide strong evidence for the formation of noncollinear spin textures in thin films of Mn2RhSn. Using these films, it is shown that individual nano&#8208;objects can be deleted using a local magnetic field from a magnetic tip and collections of nano&#8208;objects can be similarly written. These observations suggest a path toward the use of these objects in thin films with D2d symmetry as magnetic memory elements.

         <title>Geometric Modulation of Local CO Flux in Ag@Cu2O Nanoreactors for Steering the CO2RR Pathway toward High&#8208;Efficacy Methane Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique category of CO2RR catalysts with a yolk&#8211;shell nanocell structure, comprising an Ag core and a Cu2O shell that resembles a tandem nanoreactor, is fabricated. The shell envelope size can be finely tuned to regulate the CO flux arriving at the oxide&#8208;derived Cu shell, which further modulates *CO coverage and *H adsorption, consequently steering the electrocatalytic CO2RR pathway.








Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to CH4 stands as one of the promising paths for resourceful CO2 utilization in meeting the imminent &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; goal of the near future. Yet, limited success has been witnessed in the development of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts imparting satisfactory methane selectivity at a commercially viable current density. Herein, a unique category of CO2RR catalysts is fabricated with the yolk&#8211;shell nanocell structure, comprising an Ag core and a Cu2O shell that resembles the tandem nanoreactor. By fixing the Ag core and tuning the Cu2O envelope size, the CO flux arriving at the oxide&#8208;derived Cu shell can be regulated, which further modulates the *CO coverage and *H adsorption at the Cu surface, consequently steering the CO2RR pathway. Density functional theory simulations show that lower CO coverage favors methane formation via stabilizing the intermediate *CHO. As a result, the best catalyst in the flow cell shows a high CH4 Faraday efficiency of 74 &#177; 2% and partial current density of 178 &#177; 5 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.2 VRHE, ranking above the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts reported today for methane production. These findings mark the significance of precision synthesis in tailoring the catalyst geometry for achieving desired CO2RR performance.

         <title>Highly Efficient Far&#8208;Red/NIR&#8208;Absorbing Neutral Ir(III) Complex Micelles for Potent Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing neutral Ir(III) complex (BODIPY&#8208;Ir) bearing the distyryl boron dipyrromethene motif and its encapsulated micelles (Micelle&#8208;Ir) are reported for potent photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) against aggressive tumors. Micelle&#8208;Ir demonstrates a remarkable therapeutic efficacy against primary breast and metastatic lung tumors through bifunctional PDT/PTT damage in a cooperative manner.








Abstract
A critical issue in photodynamic therapy (PDT) is inadequate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in tumors, causing inevitable survival of tumor cells that usually results in tumor recurrence and metastasis. Existing photosensitizers frequently suffer from relatively low light&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion efficiency with far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation due to low&#8208;lying excited states that lead to rapid non&#8208;radiative decays. Here, a neutral Ir(III) complex bearing distyryl boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY&#8208;Ir) is reported to efficiently produce both ROS and hyperthermia upon far&#8208;red light activation for potentiating in vivo tumor suppression through micellization of BODIPY&#8208;Ir to form &#8220;Micelle&#8208;Ir&#8221;. BODIPY&#8208;Ir absorbs strongly at 550&#8211;750&#160;nm with a band maximum at 685&#160;nm, and possesses a long&#8208;lived triplet excited state with sufficient non&#8208;radiative decays. Upon micellization, BODIPY&#8208;Ir forms J&#8208;type aggregates within Micelle&#8208;Ir, which boosts both singlet oxygen generation and the photothermal effect through the high molar extinction coefficient and amplification of light&#8208;to&#8208;ROS/heat conversion, causing severe cell apoptosis. Bifunctional Micelle&#8208;Ir that accumulates in tumors completely destroys orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors via synergistic PDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) damage under light irradiation, and enables remarkable suppression of metastatic nodules in the lungs, together without significant dark cytotoxicity. The present study offers an emerging approach to develop far&#8208;red/NIR photosensitizers toward potent cancer therapy.

         <title>Effective Piezo&#8208;Phototronic Enhancement of Flexible Photodetectors Based on 2D Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric Single&#8208;Crystalline Thin&#8208;Films</title>

         <dc:description>
Effective piezo&#8208;phototronic enhancement of flexible photodetectors based on ferroelectric EA4Pb3Br10 single&#8208;crystalline thin&#8208;films is demonstrated. Under external strains, the responsivity of the photodetectors can be enhanced by as much as 284%. These findings shed light on the piezo&#8208;phototronic effect for optimizing the performance of perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices, and offer a promising avenue to broaden functionalities of hybrid perovskites.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are very attractive for optoelectronic applications because of their numerous exceptional properties. The emerging 2D perovskite ferroelectrics, in which are the coupling of spontaneous polarization and piezoelectric effects, as well as photoexcitation and semiconductor behaviors, have great appeal in the field of piezo&#8208;phototronics that enable to effectively improve the performance of optoelectronic devices via modulating the electro&#8208;optical processes. However, current studies on 2D perovskite ferroelectrics focus on bulk ceramics that cannot endure irregular mechanical deformation and limit their application in flexible optoelectronics and piezo&#8208;phototronics. Herein, we synthesize ferroelectric EA4Pb3Br10 single&#8208;crystalline thin&#8208;films (SCFs) for integration into flexible photodetectors. The in&#8208;plane multiaxial ferroelectricity is evident within the EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs through systematic characterizations. Flexible photodetectors based on EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs are achieved with an impressive photodetection performance. More importantly, optoelectronic EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs incorporated with in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization and effective piezoelectric coefficient show great promise for the observation of piezo&#8208;phototronic effect, which is capable of greatly enhancing the photodetector performance. Under external strains, the responsivity of the flexible photodetectors can be modulated by piezo&#8208;phototronic effect with a remarkable enhancement up to 284%. Our findings shed light on the piezo&#8208;phototronic devices and offer a promising avenue to broaden functionalities of hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics.

         <title>Germanium Nanosheets with Dirac Characteristics as a Saturable Absorber for Ultrafast Pulse Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge nanosheets with &#8730;3 &#215;&#160;&#8730;3 germanene as the top layer are successfully grown on a Ag (111) substrate. Dirac characteristics, ultrafast carrier dynamics, and large nonlinear absorption coefficient are experimentally observed from the Ge nanosheets, which are further applied as new saturable absorbers to construct an ultrafast mode&#8208;locked laser, and sub&#8208;picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized.








Abstract
Bulk germanium as a group&#8208;IV photonic material has been widely studied due to its relatively large refractive index and broadband and low propagation loss from near&#8208;infrared to mid&#8208;infrared. Inspired by the research of graphene, the 2D counterpart of bulk germanium, germanene, has been discovered and the characteristics of Dirac electrons have been observed. However, the optical properties of germanene still remain elusive. In this work, several layers of germanene are prepared with Dirac electronic characteristics and its morphology, band structure, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties are systematically investigated. It is surprisingly found that germanene has a fast carrier&#8208;relaxation time comparable to that of graphene and a relatively large nonlinear absorption coefficient, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these findings, germanene is applied as a new saturable absorber to construct an ultrafast mode&#8208;locked laser, and sub&#8208;picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized. The results suggest that germanene can be used as a new type of group&#8208;IV material for various nonlinear optics and photonic applications.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field Tunable Intertwined Checkerboard Charge Order and Nematicity in the Surface Layer of Sr2RuO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using ultralow temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, the low&#8208;energy electronic structure of the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 is revealed. Small structural distortions lead to radically different properties compared to the bulk with multiple van Hove singularities close to the Fermi energy giving rise to nematic and charge orders. The van Hove singularities can be manipulated by a magnetic field.








Abstract
In strongly correlated electron materials, the electronic, spin, and charge degrees of freedom are closely intertwined. This often leads to the stabilization of emergent orders that are highly sensitive to external physical stimuli promising opportunities for technological applications. In perovskite ruthenates, this sensitivity manifests in dramatic changes of the physical properties with subtle structural details of the RuO6 octahedra, stabilizing enigmatic correlated ground states, from a hotly debated superconducting state via electronic nematicity and metamagnetic quantum criticality to ferromagnetism. Here, it is demonstrated that the rotation of the RuO6 octahedra in the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 generates new emergent orders not observed in the bulk material. Through atomic&#8208;scale spectroscopic characterization of the low&#8208;energy electronic states, four van Hove singularities are identified in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The singularities can be directly linked to intertwined nematic and checkerboard charge order. Tuning of one of these van Hove singularities by magnetic field is demonstrated, suggesting that the surface layer undergoes a Lifshitz transition at a magnetic field of &#8776;32T. The results establish the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 as an exciting 2D correlated electron system and highlight the opportunities for engineering the low&#8208;energy electronic states in these&#160;systems.

         <title>Multifunctional Conjugated Ligand Engineering for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the challenges in perovskite solar cells is passivating the perovskite surface without hindering charge extraction. In this work, a conjugated ligand is introduced to the interface between perovskite and hole&#8208;transporting layer, showing efficient hole extraction with improved energy level alignment and suppressed phase segregation. Therefore, devices with high efficiency and stability are achieved.








Abstract
Surface passivation is an effective way to boost the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, a key challenge faced by most of the passivation strategies is reducing the interface charge recombination without imposing energy barriers to charge extraction. Here, a novel multifunctional semiconducting organic ammonium cationic interface modifier inserted between the light&#8208;harvesting perovskite film and the hole&#8208;transporting layer is reported. It is shown that the conjugated cations can directly extract holes from perovskite efficiently, and simultaneously reduce interface non&#8208;radiative recombination. Together with improved energy level alignment and the stabilized interface in the device, a triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide medium&#8208;bandgap PSC with an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.06% (improved from 19.94%) and suppressed ion migration and halide phase segregation, which lead to a long&#8208;term operational stability, is demonstrated. This strategy provides a new practical method of interface engineering in PSCs toward improved efficiency and stability.

         <title>Intrinsic Electron Localization of Metastable MoS2 Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable MoS2 with intrinsic electron localization is demonstrated as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction. The NH3 yield rate and the Faradaic efficiency of metastable 1T&#8243;&#8242; MoS2 are about 9 and 12 times than those of 2H MoS2, correspondingly. This work develops a new class of non&#8208;noble materials catalysts for nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
The advancement of efficient electrocatalysts toward the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is critical in sustainable ammonia synthesis under ambient pressure and temperature. Manipulating the electronic configuration of electrocatalysts is particularly vital to form metal&#8211;nitrogen (M&#63743;N) bonds during the NRR through regulating the active electronic states of sites. Here, in sharp contrast to stable 2H MoS2 without metal chains, Mo&#63743;Mo bonding in metastable polymorphs of MoS2 bulk (zigzag chain in the 1T&#8242; phase and diamond chain in the 1T&#8243;&#8242; phase) is discovered to significantly increase intrinsic electron localization around the metal chains. This can enhance the charge transfer from the adsorbed nitrogen molecule to the metal chains, allowing for boosted NRR kinetics. The electrochemical experiments show that the NH3 yield rate and the faradaic efficiency of the metastable 1T&#8243;&#8242; MoS2 rich with abundant Mo&#8211;Mo bonds are about 9 and 12 times above average than those of 2H MoS2, correspondingly. Theoretical simulations reveal the high local electron density surrounding the Mo&#63743;Mo chains and sites can promote &#960; back&#8208;donation, which is beneficial for increasing nitrogen adsorption, strengthening the M&#63743;N bonds, and reducing the cleavage barrier of the triple N&#63741;N bond.

A most important endeavor in modern materials&#8217; research is the current shift toward green environmental and sustainable materials. Natural resources are one of the attractive building blocks for making environmentally friendly materials. In most cases, however, the performance of nature&#8208;derived materials is inferior to the performance of carefully designed synthetic materials. This is especially true for conductive polymers, which is the topic here. Inspired by the natural role of proteins in mediating protons, their utilization in the creation of a free&#8208;standing transparent polymer with a highly elastic nature and proton conductivity comparable to that of synthetic polymers, is demonstrated. Importantly, the polymerization process relies on natural protein crosslinkers and is spontaneous and energy&#8208;efficient. The protein used, bovine serum albumin, is one of the most affordable proteins, resulting in the ability to create large&#8208;scale materials at a low cost. Due to the inherent biodegradability and biocompatibility of the elastomer, it is promising for biomedical applications. Here, its immediate utilization as a solid&#8208;state interface for sensing of electrophysiological signals, is shown.

&lt;p&gt;Serum albumin is used as an affordable raw material for the creation of a transparent polymer using a green chemistry one-pot process, having attractive protonic-conductivity (5 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and elastic properties. The resulting polymer is cheap with a price-tag of $0.01 per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and it is used as a solid-state flexible platform for physio-electric sensing.

         <title>&#8220;Manipulation&#8221; of Crystal Structure by Methylthiolation Enabling Ultrahigh Mobility in a Pyrene&#8208;Based Molecular Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylthiolation is a simple but powerful way to control the crystal structures and thus the transport properties of molecular semiconductors; the sandwich herringbone structure of pyrene is altered into a new type of brickwork structure in 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene), which turns out to be an excellent molecular semiconductor showing ultrahigh mobility and band&#8208;like transport in the single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Control and prediction of crystal structures of molecular semiconductors are considered challenging, yet they are crucial for rational design of superior molecular semiconductors. It is here reported that through methylthiolation, one can rationally control the crystal structure of pyrene derivatives as molecular semiconductors; 1,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)pyrene keeps a similar sandwich herringbone structure to that of parent pyrene, whereas 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) takes a new type of brickwork structure. Such changes in these crystal structures are explained by the alteration of intermolecular interactions that are efficiently controlled by methylthiolation. Single crystals of MT&#8208;pyrene are evaluated as the active semiconducting material in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;FETs), which show extremely high mobility (32 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 on average) operating at the drain and gate voltages of &#8722;5&#160;V. Moreover, the band&#8208;like transport and very low trap density are experimentally confirmed for the MT&#8208;pyrene SC&#8208;FETs, testifying that the MT&#8208;pyrene is among the best molecular semiconductors for the SC&#8208;FET devices.

         <title>Vortex&#8208;Oriented Ferroelectric Domains in SnTe/PbTe Monolayer Lateral Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnTe/PbTe monolayer lateral heterostructures are experimentally created through a two&#8208;step molecular beam epitaxial growth process. A vortex&#8208;oriented quadrant ferroelectric domain configuration is observed in the van der Waals 2D material heterostructure in this work.








Abstract
Heterostructures formed from interfaces between materials with complementary properties often display unconventional physics. Of especial interest are heterostructures formed with ferroelectric materials. These are mostly formed by combining thin layers in vertical stacks. Here the first in situ molecular beam epitaxial growth and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of atomically sharp lateral heterostructures between a ferroelectric SnTe monolayer and a paraelectric PbTe monolayer are reported. The bias voltage dependence of the apparent heights of SnTe and PbTe monolayers, which are closely related to the type&#8208;II band alignment of the heterostructure, is investigated. Remarkably, it is discovered that the ferroelectric domains in the SnTe surrounding a PbTe core form either clockwise or counterclockwise vortex&#8208;oriented quadrant configurations. In addition, when there is a finite angle between the polarization and the interface, the perpendicular component of the polarization always points from SnTe to PbTe. Supported by first&#8208;principles calculation, the mechanism of vortex formation and preferred polarization direction is identified in the interaction between the polarization, the space charge, and the strain effect at the horizontal heterointerface. The studies bring the application of 2D group&#8208;IV monochalcogenides on in&#8208;plane ferroelectric heterostructures a step closer.

         <title>Electrostatically Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Plasmonic Resonances in Solution&#8208;Processed Atomically Thin NbSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin NbSe2 shows near&#8208;infrared plasmonic resonance that is thickness&#8208;dependant and can be in situ modulated by an electrostatic voltage applied through an ion gel. These results demonstrate a new strategy to access electrostatically tunable near&#8208;infrared plasmonic sources.








Abstract
In the broad spectral range, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) plasmonics find applications in telecommunication, energy harvesting, sensing, and more, all of which would benefit from an electrostatically controllable NIR plasmon source. However, it is difficult to control bulk NIR plasmonics directly with electrostatics because of the strong electric&#8208;field screening effect and high carrier concentration required to support NIR plasmons. Here, this constraint is overcome and the observation of NIR plasmonic resonances that can be modulated electrostatically over a range of &#8776;360 cm&#8211;1 in few&#8208;layer NbSe2 gratings is reported, thanks to the enhanced electrostatics of atomically thin 2D materials and the high&#8208;quality film produced by a solution method. NbSe2 plasmons also render strong field confinement due to their atomic thickness and provide an extra degree of resonance frequency modulation from the layered structure. This study identifies metallic 2D materials as promising (easily produced and well&#8208;performing) candidates to extend electrostatically tunable plasmonics to the technologically important NIR range.

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Single&#8208;Component Polymer Solar Cells with Approaching 9% Efficiency</title>

Two narrow&#8208;bandgap block copolymers PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6 are designed and synthesized for single&#8208;component polymer solar cells, and a record&#8208;high efficiency of 8.64% is obtained. Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit relatively small energy loss and improved storage stability under both ambient condition and continued 80 &#176;C thermal stresses for over 1000 h.








Abstract
Two narrow&#8208;bandgap block conjugated polymers with a (D1&#8211;A1)&#8211;(D2&#8211;A2) backbone architecture, namely PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, are designed and synthesized for single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). Both polymers contain same donor polymer, PBDB&#8208;T, but different polymerized nonfullerene molecule acceptors. Compared to all previously reported materials for SCOSCs, PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6 exhibit narrower bandgap for better light harvesting. When incorporated into SCOSCs, the short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) is significantly improved to over 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, together with a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.64%. Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit low energy loss due to high charge transfer (CT) states (Ect) plus small non&#8208;radiative loss (0.26&#160;eV), and improved stability under both ambient condition and continuous 80&#160;&#176;C thermal stresses for over 1000 h. Determination of the charge carrier dynamics and film morphology in these SCOSCs reveals increased carrier recombination, relative to binary bulk&#8208;heterojunction devices, which is mainly due to reduced ordering of both donor and acceptor fragments. The close structural relationship between block polymers and their binary counterparts also provides an excellent framework to explore further molecular features that impact the photovoltaic performance and boost the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of SCOSCs.

&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) is significantly improved to over 15&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, together with a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.64%. Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit low energy loss due to high charge transfer (CT) states (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ct&lt;/sub&gt;) plus small non-radiative loss (0.26&#160;eV), and improved stability under both ambient condition and continuous 80&#160;&#176;C thermal stresses for over 1000 h. Determination of the charge carrier dynamics and film morphology in these SCOSCs reveals increased carrier recombination, relative to binary bulk-heterojunction devices, which is mainly due to reduced ordering of both donor and acceptor fragments. The close structural relationship between block polymers and their binary counterparts also provides an excellent framework to explore further molecular features that impact the photovoltaic performance and boost the state-of-the-art efficiency of SCOSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A pH&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Unpacking Capsule Containing Zwitterionic Hydrogel&#8208;Coated MOF Nanoparticles for Efficient Oral Exendin&#8208;4 Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;triggered self&#8208;unpacking capsule encapsulating zwitterionic hydrogel&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles is developed for efficient oral exendin&#8208;4 delivery. The capsules are rapidly unpacked in the intestinal environment, driving the rapid release of the nanovehicles. The zwitterionic hydrogel layer improves both mucus penetration and internalization by the intestinal epithelial cells of the nanoparticles, leading to markedly enhanced pharmacological availability of exendin&#8208;4.








Abstract
Oral peptide or protein delivery is considered a revolutionary alternative to daily subcutaneous injection; however, major challenges remain in terms of impediments of the gastrointestinal environment and the intestinal epithelium consisting of mucus and the epithelial cell layer, leading to low bioavailability. To protect against gastrointestinal degradation and promote penetration across the intestinal mucosa, a pH&#8208;triggered self&#8208;unpacking capsule encapsulating zwitterionic hydrogel&#8208;coated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles is engineered. The MOF nanoparticles possess a high exendin&#8208;4 loading capacity, and the zwitterionic hydrogel layer imparts unique capability of permeation across the mucus layer and effective internalization by epithelial cells to the nano&#8208;vehicles. In addition to the gastro&#8208;resistant feature, the pH&#8208;responsive capsules are dissociated drastically in the intestinal environment due to the rapid generation of abundant CO2 bubbles, which triggers a sudden release of the nanoparticles. After oral administration of the capsules containing exendin&#8208;4&#8208;loaded nanoparticles into a diabetes rat model, markedly enhanced plasma exendin&#8208;4 levels are achieved for over 8 h, leading to significantly increased endogenous insulin secretion and a remarkable hypoglycemic effect with a relative pharmacological availability of 17.3%. Owing to the low risk of hypoglycemia, this oral exendin&#8208;4 strategy will provide a vast potential for daily and facile diabetes treatment.

         <title>Tetrafluoroborate&#8208;Induced Reduction in Defect Density in Hybrid Perovskites through Halide Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface treatment of MAPbI3 through methylammonium tetrafluoroborate (MABF4) leads to reduced non&#8208;radiative charge&#8208;carrier recombination with a reduction in first&#8208;order recombination rate by an order of magnitude. Solid&#8208;state NMR is used to elucidate the atomic&#8208;level mechanism of the BF4&#8722;&#8208;additive&#8208;induced improvements, revealing that it can act as a scavenger of excess methylammonium iodide (MAI).








Abstract
Hybrid&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices are demonstrating unprecedented growth in performance, and defect passivation approaches are highly promising routes to further improve properties. Here, the effect of the molecular ion BF4&#8722;, introduced via methylammonium tetrafluoroborate (MABF4) in a surface treatment for MAPbI3 perovskite, is reported. Optical spectroscopy characterization shows that the introduction of tetrafluoroborate leads to reduced non&#8208;radiative charge&#8208;carrier recombination with a reduction in first&#8208;order recombination rate from 6.5 &#215; 106 to 2.5 &#215; 105 s&#8722;1 in BF4&#8722;&#8208;treated samples, and a consequent increase in photoluminescence quantum yield by an order of magnitude (from 0.5 to 10.4%). 19F, 11B, and 14N solid&#8208;state NMR is used to elucidate the atomic&#8208;level mechanism of the BF4&#8722; additive&#8208;induced improvements, revealing that the BF4&#8722; acts as a scavenger of excess MAI by forming MAI&#8211;MABF4 cocrystals. This shifts the equilibrium of iodide concentration in the perovskite phase, thereby reducing the concentration of interstitial iodide defects that act as deep traps and non&#8208;radiative recombination centers. These collective results allow us to elucidate the microscopic mechanism of action of BF4&#8722;.

         <title>Reversible Photothermal Modulation of Electrical Activity of Excitable Cells using Polydopamine Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomaterial&#8208;based optical modulation of excitable cells is demonstrated using biocompatible polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles as photothermal transducers. In the presence of PDA nanoparticles, neural spiking activity and cardiomyocyte beating rate are reversibly and controllably modulated by applying a near&#8208;IR laser with different power densities. The 3D collagen/PDA foam adds extra capabilities to this neuromodulation platform by localizing the photothermal effect.








Abstract
Advances in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials with desired biophysicochemical properties can be harnessed to develop non&#8208;invasive neuromodulation technologies. Here, the reversible modulation of the electrical activity of neurons and cardiomyocytes is demonstrated using polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles as photothermal nanotransducers. In addition to their broad light absorption and excellent photothermal activity, PDA nanoparticles are highly biocompatible and biodegradable, making them excellent candidates for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The modulation of the activity (i.e., spike rate of the neurons and beating rate of cardiomyocytes) of excitable cells can be finely controlled by varying the excitation power density and irradiation duration. Under optimal conditions, reversible suppression (&#8776;100%) of neural activity and reversible enhancement (two&#8208;fold) in the beating rate of cardiomyocytes is demonstrated. To improve the ease of interfacing of photothermal transducers with these excitable cells and enable spatial localization of the photothermal stimulus, a collagen/PDA nanoparticle foam is realized, which can be used as an &#8220;add&#8208;on patch&#8221; for photothermal stimulation. The non&#8208;genetic optical neuromodulation approach using biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles represents a minimally invasive method for controlling the activity of excitable cells with potential applications in nano&#8208;neuroscience and engineering.

Photodetectors
In article number 2101263, Jianhua Hao and co&#8208;workers report the use of ferroelectric EA4Pb3Br10 single&#8208;crystalline thin&#8208;films to broaden perovskite photodetection applications with piezo&#8208;phototronic effect enhanced behavior. The coupling of ferroelectric spontaneous polarization and the piezoelectric effect, as well as photoexcitation and semiconductor behaviors endow the EA4Pb3Br10&#8208;based flexible photodetectors with a strain&#8208;modulated capability, giving rise to an effective enhancement of photodetection performance via the piezo&#8208;phototronic effect.

Sr2RuO4 Surface Layers
As reported by Peter Wahl and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100593, small structural distortions in the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 create a system with radically different properties compared to the bulk, giving rise to multiple van Hove singularities and nematic and checkerboard charge orders. The image shows the structure of the van Hove singularity in reflection from the checkerboard order and nematicity, which are both required to understand the new exciting physics.

Superhydrophobic Surfaces
In article number 2102108, Debashis Chanda and co&#8208;workers report organic superhydrophobic surfaces created using colloidal gels of fullerite C60 and C70. Non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic films and coatings developed using such semiconducting photosensitizer materials can be exploited in many applications. Furthermore, fullerite films are superaerophilic in an aqueous environment and can stay dry for up to 3 h even at a water depth of 60 cm.

Germanene
Several layers of germanene with Dirac characteristics and ultrafast carrier dynamics are produced by  Guanyu Liu, Yi Du, Qiaoliang Bao, and co&#8208;workers, as reported in article number 2101042. As a new group&#8208;IV member material, germanene is further demonstrated as a promising saturable absorber to construct ultrafast mode&#8208;locked lasers and generate sub&#8208;picosecond pulses in the telecommunication band.

Recent advancements of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic photocatalysis are systematically summarized, including their design and synthetic strategies, photocatalytic performance, and mechanistic understanding. In addition, approaches for the enhancement of light&#8208;utilization efficiency and construction of active centers on Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts are highlighted and discussed.








Abstract
With the capability of inducing intense electromagnetic field, energetic charge carriers, and photothermal effect, plasmonic metals provide a unique opportunity for efficient light utilization and chemical transformation. Earth&#8208;abundant low&#8208;cost Cu possesses intense and tunable localized surface plasmon resonance from ultraviolet&#8208;visible to near infrared region. Moreover, Cu essentially exhibits remarkable catalytic performance toward various reactions owing to its intriguing physical and chemical properties. Coupling with light&#8208;harvesting ability and catalytic function, plasmonic Cu serves as a promising platform for efficient light&#8208;driven chemical reaction. Herein, recent advancements of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic photocatalysis are systematically summarized, including designing and synthetic strategies for Cu&#8208;based catalysts, plasmonic catalytic performance, and mechanistic understanding over Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts. What's more, approaches for the enhancement of light utilization efficiency and construction of active centers on Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts are highlighted and discussed in detail, such as morphology and size control, regulation of electronic structure, defect and strain engineering, etc. Remaining challenges and future perspectives for further development of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysis are also proposed.

         <title>Electroactive Biomaterials and Systems for Cell Fate Determination and Tissue Regeneration: Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive understanding of endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity is provided, along with recent progress in the study of electroactive biomaterials and systems, and their mediated electrostimulation in tissue regeneration.








Abstract
During natural tissue regeneration, tissue microenvironment and stem cell niche including cell&#8211;cell interaction, soluble factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) provide a train of biochemical and biophysical cues for modulation of cell behaviors and tissue functions. Design of functional biomaterials to mimic the tissue/cell microenvironment have great potentials for tissue regeneration applications. Recently, electroactive biomaterials have drawn increasing attentions not only as scaffolds for cell adhesion and structural support, but also as modulators to regulate cell/tissue behaviors and function, especially for electrically excitable cells and tissues. More importantly, electrostimulation can further modulate a myriad of biological processes, from cell cycle, migration, proliferation and differentiation to neural conduction, muscle contraction, embryogenesis, and tissue regeneration. In this review, endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity are introduced. Then, design rationale of electroactive biomaterials is discussed for imitating dynamic cell microenvironment, as well as their mediated electrostimulation and the applying pathways. Recent advances in electroactive biomaterials are systematically overviewed for modulation of stem cell fate and tissue regeneration, mainly including nerve regeneration, bone tissue engineering, and cardiac tissue engineering. Finally, the significance for simulating the native tissue microenvironment is emphasized and the open challenges and future perspectives of electroactive biomaterials are concluded.

         <title>Comprehensive Understandings into Complete Reconstruction of Precatalysts: Synthesis, Applications, and Characterizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive understanding into complete reconstruction of precatalysts is summarized, mainly including its fundamental understandings, advantages, and features of completely reconstructed catalysts, design principles/strategies, extensive electrocatalysis applications, and advanced characterizations. This review is expected to arouse attention on the complete reconstruction materials for multifunctional applications in energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Reconstruction induced by external environment (such as applied voltage bias and test electrolytes) changes catalyst component and catalytic behaviors. Investigations of complete reconstruction in energy conversion recently receive intensive attention, which promote the targeted design of top&#8208;performance materials with maximum component utilization and good stability. However, the advantages of complete reconstruction, its design strategies, and extensive applications have not achieved the profound understandings and summaries it deserves. Here, this review systematically summarizes several important advances in complete reconstruction for the first time, which includes 1) fundamental understandings of complete reconstruction, the characteristics and advantages of completely reconstructed catalysts, and their design principles, 2) types of reconstruction&#8208;involved precatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction catalysis in wide pH solution, and origins of limited reconstruction degree as well as design strategies/principles toward complete reconstruction, 3) complete reconstruction for novel material synthesis and other electrocatalysis fields, and 4) advanced in situ/operando or multiangle/level characterization techniques to capture the dynamic reconstruction processes and real catalytic contributors. Finally, the existing major challenges and unexplored/unsolved issues on studying the reconstruction chemistry are summarized, and an outlook for the further development of complete reconstruction is briefly proposed. This review will arouse the attention on complete reconstruction materials and their applications in diverse fields.

         <dc:description>
Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) are an emerging class of near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR) QDs with excellent NIR fluorescence properties and biocompatibility. The various methods to synthesize NIR Ag2S QDs are presented, focusing on their bioapplications in biosensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. Major challenges and future perspectives with respect to the synthesis and bioapplications of NIR Ag2S QDs are discussed.








Abstract
Quantum dots (QDs) with near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR) are an emerging class of QDs with unique capabilities owing to the deeper tissue penetrability of NIR light compared with visible light. NIR light also effectively overcomes organism autofluorescence, making NIR QDs particularly attractive in biological imaging applications for disease diagnosis. Considering latest developments, Ag2S QDs are a rising star among NIR QDs due to their excellent NIR fluorescence properties and biocompatibility. This review presents the various methods to synthesize NIR Ag2S QDs, and systematically discusses their applications in biosensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. Major challenges and future perspectives concerning the synthesis and bioapplications of NIR Ag2S QDs are discussed.

         <title>Alternative Lone&#8208;Pair ns2&#8208;Cation&#8208;Based Semiconductors beyond Lead Halide Perovskites for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent progress on emerging Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing lone&#8208;pair ns2 cations is provided, with the purpose of providing valid insights for discovering auspicious optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. The issues hindering performance enhancement and the design strategies of novel ns2&#8208;cation&#8208;based optoelectronic semiconductors are discussed.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as advantageous high&#8208;performance optoelectronic semiconductors, and have undergone rapid development for diverse applications such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes , and photodetectors. While material instability and lead toxicity are still major concerns hindering their commercialization, they offer promising prospects and design principles for developing promising optoelectronic materials. The distinguished optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites stem from the Pb2+ cation with a lone&#8208;pair 6s2 electronic configuration embedded in a mixed covalent&#8211;ionic bonding lattice. Herein, we&#160;summarize alternative Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing lone&#8208;pair ns2 cations, intending to offer insights for developing potential optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. We&#160;start with the physical underpinning of how the ns2 cations within the material lattice allow for superior optoelectronic properties. We&#160;then review the emerging Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing ns2 cations in terms of structural dimensionality, which is crucial for optoelectronic performance. For each category of materials, the research progresses on crystal structures, electronic/optical properties, device applications, and recent efforts for performance enhancements are overviewed. Finally, the issues hindering the further developments of studied materials are surveyed along with possible strategies to overcome them, which also provides an outlook on the future research in this field.

We&#160;start with the physical underpinning of how the ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cations within the material lattice allow for superior optoelectronic properties. We&#160;then review the emerging Pb-free semiconductors containing ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cations in terms of structural dimensionality, which is crucial for optoelectronic performance. For each category of materials, the research progresses on crystal structures, electronic/optical properties, device applications, and recent efforts for performance enhancements are overviewed. Finally, the issues hindering the further developments of studied materials are surveyed along with possible strategies to overcome them, which also provides an outlook on the future research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive AIEgens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) are one of the optimal choices for smart luminescent materials to be applied in real life and they have sparked much of the current interest in the smart materials area. Therefore, a myriad of AIE materials with diverse stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been developed in recent years, and they exhibit broad application prospects.








Abstract
The unique advantages and the exciting application prospects of AIEgens have triggered booming developments in this area in recent years. Among them, stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens have received particular attention and impressive progress, and they have been demonstrated to show tremendous potential in many fields from physical chemistry to materials science and to biology and medicine. Here, the recent achievements of stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens in terms of seven most representative types of stimuli including force, light, polarity, temperature, electricity, ion, and pH, are summarized. Based on typical examples, it is illustrated how each type of systems realize the desired stimuli&#8208;responsive performance for various applications. The key work principles behind them are ultimately deciphered and figured out to offer new insights and guidelines for the design and engineering of the next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for more broad applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Crosslinked Dynamic Hydrogel Incorporating {Mo154} with pH and NIR Responsiveness for Chemo&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual pH&#8208; and near infra&#8208;red (NIR)&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized polyethylene glycol, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan, and a polyoxometalate {Mo154}. Crosslinked by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions, the hydrogel has dynamic networks, injectability, and fast self&#8208;healing properties. Combining doxorubicin and NIR laser irradiation, the hydrogel shows thermal ablation of cancer cells and simultaneous release of drugs for chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates are an emerging class of molecular clusters, with well&#8208;defined structures and chemical compositions that are produced through simple, low&#8208;cost, and highly reproducible methods. In particular, the wheel&#8208;shaped cluster {Mo154} is a promising photothermal agent due to its intervalence charge transfer transitions. However, its toxicity hinders its systemic administration, being the development of a localized delivery system still incipient. Herein, an injectable and self&#8208;healing hydrogel of easy preparation and administration is developed, incorporating both {Mo154} and doxorubicin for synergistic photothermal and chemotherapy applications. The hydrogel is composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized polyethylene glycol, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan and {Mo154}. The gelation occurs within 60&#160;s at room temperature, and the dual crosslinking by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions generates a dynamic network, which enables self&#8208;healing after injection. Moreover, the hydrogel delivers chemotherapeutic drugs, with a release triggered by dual near infra&#8208;red (NIR) radiation and pH changes. This stimuli&#8208;responsive release system along with the photothermal conversion ability of the hydrogel allows the simultaneous combination of photothermal and chemotherapy. This synergic system efficiently ablates the cancer tumor in vivo with no systemic toxicity. Overall, this work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based systems, incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for dual chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.

         <title>Anisotropic Iridescence and Polarization Patterns in a Direct Ink Written Chiral Photonic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural examples of patterned iridescence, an ink based on a chiral nematic liquid crystal that can be processed with a direct ink writer 3D printer is shown. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis that exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity.








Abstract
The iridescence of structural color and its polarization characteristics originate from the nanoscale organization of materials. A major challenge in materials science is generating the bright, lustrous hues seen in nature through nanoscale engineering, while simultaneously controlling interaction of the material with different light polarizations. In this work, a suitable chiral nematic liquid crystal elastomer ink is synthesized for direct ink writing, which self&#8208;assembles into a chiral photonic structure. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis, which exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity. After crosslinking, a freely programmable, chiroptical photonic polymer material is obtained. The strongly perspective&#8208;dependent appearance of the material can function as specialized anticounterfeit markers, as optical elements in decorative iridescent coatings, or, as demonstrated here, in optically based signaling features.

         <title>Bitter Flavored, Soft Composites for Wearables Designed to Reduce Risks of Choking in Infants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bitter&#8208;flavored formulations in soft encapsulating layers and hydrogel adhesives for skin&#8208;interfaced wireless devices reduce risks of choking with infants. A bitter dopant, denatonium benzoate, integrated into soft silicone elastomers and hydrogels triggers a reflexive response when dissolved in saliva. Demonstrations in a variety of devices for physiological monitoring highlight the compatibility of these unusual composite materials in clinical&#8208;grade wearables.








Abstract
Wireless, skin&#8208;integrated devices for continuous, clinical&#8208;quality monitoring of vital signs have the potential to greatly improve the care of patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive&#8208;care units. These same technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent life&#8208;threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety feature. The materials systems described involve a non&#8208;toxic bitterant (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into various wireless skin&#8208;integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children monitored with wearable devices.

         <title>A Bioresorbable Dynamic Pressure Sensor for Cardiovascular Postoperative Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after the service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. A flexible bioresorbable triboelectric pressure sensor is demonstrated based on the triboelectric effect. It can overcome the material limitations caused by the working principle. This device is expected to be applied in postoperative care.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. However, the material limitation is a significant challenge. There are fewer biodegradable materials with pressure&#8208;sensitive properties. Here, a pressure sensor based on the triboelectric effect between bioabsorbable materials is reported. This effect is available in almost all materials. The bioresorbable triboelectric sensor (BTS) can directly convert ambient pressure changes into electrical signals. This device successfully identifies abnormal vascular occlusion events in large animals (dogs). The service life of the BTS reaches 5 days with a high service efficiency (5.95%). The BTS offers excellent sensitivity (11 mV&#160;mmHg&#8722;1), linearity (R2&#160;= 0.993), and good durability (450&#160;000 cycles). The antibacterial bioresorbable materials (poly(lactic acid)&#8211;(chitosan 4%)) for the BTS can achieve 99% sterilization. Triboelectric devices are expected to be applied in postoperative care as bioresorbable electronics.

The bioresorbable triboelectric sensor (BTS) can directly convert ambient pressure changes into electrical signals. This device successfully identifies abnormal vascular occlusion events in large animals (dogs). The service life of the BTS reaches 5 days with a high service efficiency (5.95%). The BTS offers excellent sensitivity (11 mV&#160;mmHg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), linearity (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;= 0.993), and good durability (450&#160;000 cycles). The antibacterial bioresorbable materials (poly(lactic acid)&#8211;(chitosan 4%)) for the BTS can achieve 99% sterilization. Triboelectric devices are expected to be applied in postoperative care as bioresorbable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Homogeneous Carbon/Potassium&#8208;Incorporation Strategy for Synthesizing Red Polymeric Carbon Nitride Capable of Near&#8208;Infrared Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;salt&#8208;induced homogeneous incorporation strategy realizes red carbon/potassium&#8208;incorporated polymeric carbon nitride, which exhibits highly efficient H2 evolution from water and in situ hydrogen gas (drug&#8208;free) cancer therapy excited by near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
The efficient utilization of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for photocatalytic hydrogen generation is vitally important to both solar hydrogen energy and hydrogen medicine, but remains a challenge at present, owing to the strict requirement of the semiconductor for high NIR responsiveness, narrow bandgap, and suitable redox potentials. Here, an NIR&#8208;active carbon/potassium&#8208;doped red polymeric carbon nitride (RPCN) is achieved for by using a similar&#8208;structure dopant as the melamine (C3H6N6) precursor with the solid KCl. The homogeneous and high incorporation of carbon and potassium remarkably narrows the bandgap of carbon nitride (1.7&#160;eV) and endows RPCN with a high NIR&#8208;photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water at the rate of 140 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under NIR irradiation (700 nm &#8804; &#955;&#160;&#8804; 780&#160;nm), and the apparent quantum efficiency is high as 0.84% at 700 &#177; 10&#160;nm (and 13% at 500 &#177; 10&#160;nm). A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment on a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model verifies RPCN as being capable of intratumoral NIR&#8208;photocatalytic hydrogen generation and simultaneous glutathione deprivation for safe and high&#8208;efficacy drug&#8208;free cancer therapy. The results shed light on designing efficient photocatalysts to capture the full spectrum of solar energy, and also pioneer a new pathway to develop NIR photocatalysts for hydrogen therapy of major diseases.

         <title>Daratumumab Immunopolymersome&#8208;Enabled Safe and CD38&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Depletion of Multiple Myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;nanomedicines are emerging targeted cancer therapeutics that might reshape the clinical treatment scheme. Novel fabrication of small and smart daratumumab immunopolymersomes is presented carrying vincristine sulfate that induce extraordinary potency and selectivity while mitigate systemic toxicity toward orthotopic multiple myeloma in vivo.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a second ranking hematological malignancy. Despite the fast advancement of new treatments such as bortezormib and daratumumab, MM patients remain incurable and tend to eventually become relapsed and drug&#8208;resistant. Development of novel therapies capable of depleting MM cells is strongly needed. Here, daratumumab immunopolymersomes carrying vincristine sulfate (Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR) are reported for safe and high&#8208;efficacy CD38&#8208;targeted chemotherapy and depletion of orthotopic MM in vivo. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR made by postmodification via strain&#8208;promoted click reaction holds tailored antibody density (2.2, 4.4 to 8.7 Dar per IPs), superb stability, small size (43&#8211;49&#160;nm), efficacious VCR loading, and glutathione&#8208;responsive VCR release. Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR induces exceptional anti&#8208;MM activity with an IC50 of 76 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m to CD38&#8208;positive LP&#8208;1&#160;MM cells, 12&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold enhancement over nontargeted Ps&#8208;VCR and free VCR controls, respectively. Intriguingly, mice bearing orthotopic LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc MM following four cycles of i.v. administration of Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR at 0.25&#160;mg VCR equiv. kg&#8722;1 reveal complete depletion of LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc cells, superior survival rate to all controls, and no body weight loss. The bone and histological analyses indicate bare bone and organ damage. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR appears as a safe and targeted treatment for CD38&#8208;overexpressed hematological malignancies.

         <title>Synaptic Plasticity Powering Long&#8208;Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) layer is integrated into a novel organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLET) device. The UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoinduced synaptic effect is used to power a persistent bright afterglow emission in an organic light&#8208;emitting material. The unique OLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting luminescence in optoelectronic devices is highly sought after for applications in optical data storage and display technology. While in light&#8208;emitting diodes this is achieved by exploiting long&#8208;afterglow organic materials as active components, such a strategy has never been pursued in light&#8208;emitting transistors, which are still rather unexplored and whose technological potential is yet to be demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of long&#8208;afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (LAOLETs) is reported whose operation relies on an unprecedented strategy based on a photoinduced synaptic effect in an inorganic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) semiconducting channel layer, to power a persistent electroluminescence in organic light&#8208;emitting materials. Oxygen vacancies in the IGZO layer, produced by irradiation at &#955;&#160;= 312&#160;nm, free electrons in excess yielding to a channel conductance increase. Due to the slow recombination kinetics of photogenerated electrons to oxygen vacancies in the channel layer, the organic material can be fueled by postsynaptic current and displays a long&#8208;lived light&#8208;emission (hundreds of seconds) after ceasing UV irradiation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the LAOLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.

         <title>54 cm2 Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Modules with Efficiency Above 13%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient large&#8208;area flexible solar cells and modules are demonstrated based on a printable, transparent, low&#8208;surface&#8208;roughness, flexible electrode (silver nanowires:zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine). A power conversion efficiency of 13.2% is obtained for a 54 cm2 solar module. The flexible electrode is also demonstrated in high&#8208;performance flexible quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Development of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) is highly desirable for their practical applications. However, the efficiency of the large&#8208;area flexible OSCs severely lags behind small&#8208;area devices. Here, efficient large&#8208;area flexible single cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1% and 12.6% for areas of 6 and 10 cm2, and flexible modules with a PCE of 13.2% (54 cm2) based on poly(ethylene terephthalate)/Ag grid/silver nanowires (AgNWs):zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;Zn) composite electrodes are reported. The solution&#8208;processed flexible transparent electrode of AgNWs:PEI&#8208;Zn shows low surface roughness and good optoelectronic and mechanical properties. PEI&#8208;Zn is conductive and optically transparent. It can adhere to and wrap the AgNWs under electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged surface (AgNWs) and positively charged protonated amine groups (in PEI&#8208;Zn). It wraps the AgNWs networks and fills the void space to achieve a smooth surface. The flexible electrode is validated in both flexible OSCs and flexible quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Small&#8208;area flexible OSCs show a PCE of 16.1%, and flexible QLEDs show an external quantum efficiency of 13.3%. In the end, a flexible module is demonstrated to charge a mobile phone as a flexible power source (shown in Video S1, Supporting Information).

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Eu&#8208;MOF on Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;MOF is introduced to the field of PSCs. Both Eu ions and organic ligands reduce the defect concentration. Moreover, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF improves light utilization. Meanwhile, it also turns tensile strain to compressive strain. Finally, the device performance in efficiency and stability is increased dramatically due to the synergetic effects.








Abstract
Enhancing device lifetime is one of the essential challenges in perovskite solar cells. The ultrathin Eu&#8208;MOF layer is introduced at the interface between the electron&#8208;transport layer and the perovskite absorber to improve the device stability. Both Eu ions and organic ligands in the MOF can reduce the defect concentration and improve carrier transport. Moreover, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF in perovskite films can improve light utilization and reduce the decomposition under ultraviolet light. Meanwhile, Eu&#8208;MOF also turns tensile strain to compressive strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16%. In addition, the devices retain 96% of their original PCE after 2000 h under the relative humidity of 30% and 91% of their original PCE after 1200 h after continuous 85&#160;&#176;C aging condition in N2.

         <title>Ultrafast Bubble Bursting by Superamphiphobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superamphiphobic surfaces for ultrafast bubble bursting are introduced. Liquid flame spray is fast, scalable, and allows tuning of the nano&#8208; and micrometer&#8208;scale architecture of hierarchical surface structures. Bubbles burst rapidly upon contact and the gas is absorbed into the surface structures. The recorded rates are enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to previously reported results.








Abstract
Controlling bubble motion or passively bursting bubbles using solid interfaces is advantageous in numerous industrial applications including flotation, catalysis, electrochemical processes, and microfluidics. Current research has explored the formation, dissolution, pinning, and rupturing of bubbles on different surfaces. However, the ability to tune and control the rate of bubble bursting is not yet achieved. Scaling down surface&#8208;induced bubble bursting to just a few milliseconds is important for any application. In this work, the hierarchical structure of superamphiphobic surfaces is tuned in order to rapidly rupture contacting bubbles. Surfaces prepared using liquid flame spray show ultrafast bubble bursting (down to 2&#160;ms) and superior durability. The coatings demonstrate excellent mechanical and chemical stability even in the presence of surface&#8208;active species. Air from the ruptured bubble is absorbed into the aerophilic Cassie&#8208;state. Long&#8208;term applicability is demonstrated by preventing the accumulation of air in the plastron via a connection of the plastron to the environment. The times recorded for bubble rupture and complete reorganization of air are reduced by approximately a factor of 3 compared to previously reported values. The concept is utilized to passively control surfactant&#8208;rich foam in froth flotation. Material collection efficiency increased by more than 60&#160;times compared to controls.

         <title>Reduced Intrinsic Non&#8208;Radiative Losses Allow Room&#8208;Temperature Triplet Emission from Purely Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the substitution of a hydrogen atom with an N&#8208;phenyl ring converts an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature, originating from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations, which can be used for data safety applications.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence from triplet excitons in organic molecules is rare, as fast non&#8208;radiative deactivation typically dominates over radiative transitions. This work demonstrates that the substitution of a hydrogen atom in a derivative of phenanthroimidazole with an N&#8208;phenyl ring can substantially stabilize the excited state. This stabilization converts an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature. Results from systematic photophysical investigations, kinetic modeling, excited&#8208;state dynamic modeling, and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis identify that the long&#8208;lived triplets originate from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations. Further modification of the N&#8208;phenyl ring with halogen atoms affects the afterglow lifetime and quantum yield. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an anticounterfeiting device is demonstrated with a time&#8208;dependent Morse code feature for data encryption based on these emitters. A fundamental design principle is outlined to achieve long&#8208;lived and emissive triplet states by suppressing intrinsic non&#8208;radiative relaxations in the form of molecular vibrations or rotations.

         <title>Magnetization Signature of Topological Surface States in a Non&#8208;Symmorphic Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anomalous surface superconductivity is reported in a non&#8208;symmorphic superconductor, In2Bi, where the nontrivial band structure results in the existence of topologically protected surface states (TSS). The near&#8208;perfect screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above the upper critical field is explained by proximity superconductivity of TSS. Detecting TSS via macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for identification of topological superconductors.








Abstract
Superconductors with nontrivial band structure topology represent a class of materials with unconventional and potentially useful properties. Recent years have seen much success in creating artificial hybrid structures exhibiting the main characteristics of 2D topological superconductors. Yet, bulk materials known to combine inherent superconductivity with nontrivial topology remain scarce, largely because distinguishing their central characteristic&#8212;the topological surface states&#8212;has proved challenging due to a dominant contribution from the superconducting bulk. In this work, a highly anomalous behavior of surface superconductivity in topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor In2Bi, where the surface states result from its nontrivial band structure, itself a consequence of the non&#8208;symmorphic crystal symmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, is reported. In contrast to smoothly decreasing diamagnetic susceptibility above the bulk critical field, Hc2, as seen in conventional superconductors, a near&#8208;perfect, Meissner&#8208;like screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above Hc2 is observed. The enhanced diamagnetism disappears at a new phase transition close to the critical field of surface superconductivity, Hc3. Using theoretical modeling, the anomalous screening is shown to be consistent with modification of surface superconductivity by the topological surface states. The possibility of detecting signatures of the surface states using macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for the discovery and identification of topological superconductors.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular manipulation of redox&#8208;active groups in COF units shows that quinone&#8208;functionalized COFs significantly enhance the specific capacity, elevate the discharge potential, and improve the competitiveness of Zn2+ against H+ intercalation through a stronger coordination bond between cations and C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N groups.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are potentially promising electrode materials for electrochemical charge storage applications thanks to their pre&#8208;designable reticular chemistry with atomic precision, allowing precise control of pore size, redox&#8208;active functional moieties, and stable covalent frameworks. However, studies on the mechanistic and practical aspects of their zinc&#8208;ion storage behavior are still limited. In this study, a strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of COF cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) by introducing the quinone group into 1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs is reported. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the introduction of the quinone groups in the COF significantly pushes up the Zn2+ storage capability against H+ and elevates the average (dis&#8208;)charge potential in aqueous ZIBs. Computational and experimental analysis further reveals the favorable redox&#8208;active sites that host Zn2+/H+ in COF electrodes and the root cause for the enhanced electrochemical performance. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering of the COF structure is an effective approach to achieve practical charge storage performance.

         <title>Hydrogen Passivation of M&#8211;N&#8211;C (M = Fe, Co) Catalysts for Storage Stability and ORR Activity Improvements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage stability of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts is investigated. Surface oxidation and hydroxylation are found to be responsible for serious performance degradation after long&#8208;term storage in ambient environment. A hydrogen passivation strategy is proposed to modify and protect the catalytic active sites, which can greatly improve the storage stability as well as the fuel&#8208;cell activity and power density of the catalysts.








Abstract
M&#8211;N&#8211;C (M = Fe, Co) are highly active nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and other applications. Although their operation stability has been extensively studied in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells, the storage stability that determines the performance maintenance before use has not yet been understood. Here, it is found that long&#8208;term exposure of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in air would cause surface oxidation and hydroxylation, resulting in significant decrease of ORR activity and fuel&#8208;cell performances. Hydrogen passivation is demonstrated to be an effective strategy to protect the atomic M&#8211;N4 active sites and improve the storage stability of the catalysts. In addition, the hydrogen&#8208;termination can also reduce the ORR energy barrier and increase the utilization of active sites, leading to the improvements of fuel&#8208;cell activity and power density. Notably, these findings help to understand the storage&#8208;associated degradation and protection of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Softening of Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photochemical behavior of three chromophores with distinct degradation wavelengths is exploited for the construction of selectively degradable hydrogels. Specifically, hydrogel softening can be achieved in a stepwise fashion according to the chromophores&#8217; activation wavelength, enabling fine control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Photoresponsive hydrogels hold key potential in advanced biomedical applications including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery, as well as intricately engineered functions such as biosensing, soft robotics, and bioelectronics. Herein, the wavelength&#8208;dependent degradation of bio&#8208;orthogonal poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels is reported, using three selective activation levels. Specifically, three chromophores are exploited, that is, ortho&#8208;nitrobenzene, dimethyl aminobenzene, and bimane, each absorbing light at different wavelengths. By examining their photochemical action plots, the wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity of the photocleavable moieties is determined. The wavelength&#8208;selective addressability of individual photoreactive units is subsequently translated into hydrogel design, enabling wavelength&#8208;dependent cleavage of the hydrogel networks on&#8208;demand. Critically, this platform technology allows for the fabrication of various hydrogels, whose mechanical properties can be fine&#8208;tuned using different colors of light to reach a predefined value, according to the chromophore ratios used. The softening is shown to influence the spreading of pre&#8208;osteoblastic cells adhering to the gels as a demonstration of their potential utility. Furthermore, the materials and photodegradation processes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, making this platform attractive for biomaterials engineering.

         <title>A Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19.6% Efficiency Enabled by Light Distribution Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution and employing photovoltaic materials with low energy losses in tandem photovoltaic cell, a power conversion efficiency of 19.64% is achieved.








Abstract
Despite more potential in realizing higher photovoltaic performance, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells still lags behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;junction cells. In this work, highly efficient double&#8208;junction tandem OPV cells are fabricated by optimizing the photoactive layers with low voltage losses and developing an effective method to tune optical field distribution. The tandem OPV cells studied are structured as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/bottom photoactive layer/interconnecting layer (ICL)/top photoactive layer/MoOx/Ag, where the bottom and top photoactive layers are based on blends of PBDB&#8208;TF:ITCC and PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11, respectively, and ICL refers to interconnecting layer structured as MoOx/Ag/ZnO:PFN&#8208;Br. As these results indicate that there is not much room for optimizing the bottom photoactive layer, more effort is put into fine&#8208;tuning the top photoactive layer. By rationally modulating the composition and thickness of PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 blend films, the 300 nm&#8208;thick PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 film with 1:2 D/A ratio is found to be an ideal photoactive layer for the top sub&#8208;cell in terms of photovoltaic characteristics and light distribution control. For the optimized tandem cell, a PCE of 19.64% is realized, which is the highest result in the OPV field and certified as 19.50% by the National Institute of Metrology.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Atomic Layers of Transition&#8208;Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) are produced via selectively etching a high&#8208;entropy MAX phase, in which five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab, giving rise to stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers. The resultant HE&#8208;MXene has distinct lattice distortions and strains, efficiently guiding the nucleation and uniform growth of lithium.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have great potential for energy storage and conversion due to their diverse compositions, and unexpected physical and chemical features. However, high&#8208;entropy atomic layers with fully exposed active sites are difficult to synthesize since their phases are easily segregated. Here, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) can be produced via the selective etching of novel high&#8208;entropy MAX (also termed Mn+1AXn (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3), where M represents an early transition&#8208;metal element, A is an element mainly from groups 13&#8211;16, and X stands for C and/or N) phase (HE&#8208;MAX) (Ti1/5V1/5Zr1/5Nb1/5Ta1/5)2AlC, in which the five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab due to their solid&#8208;solution feature, giving rise to a stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers owing to the high molar configurational entropy and correspondingly low Gibbs free energy. Additionally, the resultant high&#8208;entropy MXene with distinct lattice distortions leads to high mechanical strain into the atomic layers. Moreover, the mechanical strain can efficiently guide the nucleation and uniform growth of dendrite&#8208;free lithium on HE&#8208;MXene, achieving a long cycling stability of up to 1200 h and good deep stripping&#8211;plating levels of up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al Nanowire Heterostructure: From Single&#8208;Hole Quantum Dot to Josephson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly tunable superconducting&#8211;semiconducting hybrid junction based on intrinsic germanium (i&#8208;Ge) nanowires is revealed. Low&#8208;temperature transport measurements of ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt Al&#8211;Ge interfaces demonstrate that such i&#8208;Ge quantum dot devices can be tuned to access three distinct regimes: single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dot, intermediate sub&#8208;gap states regime and superconducting regime.








Abstract
Superconductor&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;superconductor heterostructures are attractive for both fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid systems as well as for future high&#8208;performance low power dissipating nanoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces are used to probe the low&#8208;temperature transport in intrinsic Ge (i&#8208;Ge) quantum dots.

&lt;p&gt;A highly tunable superconducting&#8211;semiconducting hybrid junction based on intrinsic germanium (i-Ge) nanowires is revealed. Low-temperature transport measurements of ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt Al&#8211;Ge interfaces demonstrate that such i-Ge quantum dot devices can be tuned to access three distinct regimes: single-hole-filling quantum dot, intermediate sub-gap states regime and superconducting regime.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superconductor&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;superconductor heterostructures are attractive for both fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in low-dimensional hybrid systems as well as for future high-performance low power dissipating nanoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces are used to probe the low-temperature transport in intrinsic Ge (i-Ge) quantum dots. In particular, demonstrating the ability to tune the Ge quantum dot device from completely insulating, through a single-hole-filling quantum dot regime, to a supercurrent regime, resembling a Josephson field effect transistor with a maximum critical current of 10 nA at a temperature of 390 mK. The realization of a Josephson field-effect transistor with high junction transparency provides a mechanism to study sub-gap transport mediated by Andreev states. The presented results reveal a promising intrinsic Ge-based architecture for hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor devices for the study of Majorana zero modes and key components of quantum computing such as gatemons or gate tunable superconducting quantum interference devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Holographic Display and Encryption with Full&#8208;Polarization Degree of Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalist metasurface assembling geometric phase meta&#8208;atoms in a tetratomic macro pixel is proposed, which enables the full degree of freedom tuning in polarization (orientation, ellipticity, and chirality) and color (real hue, saturation, and brightness) spaces simultaneously. The proposed strategy has great potential in multiplex&#8208;oriented applications, such as holographic data storage and information transfer.








Abstract
Metasurfaces provide a compact and powerful platform for manipulating the fundamental properties of light, and have shown unprecedented capabilities in both optical holographic display and information encryption. For increasing information display/storage capacity, metasurfaces with more polarization manipulation channel and full&#8208;color holographic functionality are now an urgent requirement. Here, a minimalist dielectric metasurface with the capability of full&#8208;color holography encoded with arbitrary polarization is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Without the daunting exploratory and computational problem in nanostructure searching, full&#8208;color holographic images can be multiplexed into arbitrary polarization channels through vectorial ptychography and k&#8208;space ptychography based on tetratomic macropixel geometric phase metasurfaces. Thanks to the full degree of freedom tuning in polarization and color spaces, the application scenarios such as holographic 3D imaging and information encryption are realized. The strategy exhibits promising potential in applications of 3Dl display, augmented/virtual reality, high&#8208;density data storage, and encryption.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Matrices with Integrated Wireless Microactuators to Study Mechanobiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vitro biomimetic platform that provides independent control over geometry, mechanics, and structure over extracellular matrices is introduced. Remote application of forces using robotically controlled magnetic microactuators triggers native mechanobiology responses including intracellular signaling and directed migration. A digital twin complements the platform by reporting stresses generated upon actuation.








Abstract
Mechanobiology explores how forces regulate cell behaviors and what molecular machinery are responsible for the sensing, transduction, and modulation of mechanical cues. To this end, probing of cells cultured on planar substrates has served as a primary experimental setting for many decades. However, native extracellular matrices (ECMs) consist of fibrous protein assemblies where the physical properties spanning from the individual fiber to the network architecture can influence the transmission of forces to and from the cells. Here, a robotic manipulation platform that allows wireless, localized, and programmable deformation of an engineered fibrous ECM is introduced. A finite&#8208;element&#8208;based digital twin of the fiber network calibrated against measured local and global parameters enables the calculation of deformations and stresses generated by different magnetic actuation schemes across a range of network properties. Physiologically relevant mechanical forces are applied to cells cultured on the fiber network, statically or dynamically, revealing insights into the effects of matrix&#8208;borne forces and deformations as well as force&#8208;mediated matrix remodeling on cell migration and intracellular signaling. These capabilities are not matched by any existing approach, and this versatile platform has the potential to uncover fundamental mechanisms of mechanobiology in settings with greater relevance to living tissues.

         <title>A Zwitterionic Polyurethane Nanoporous Device with Low Foreign&#8208;Body Response for Islet Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic nanofibrous islet encapsulation device made of sulfobetaine&#8208;modified polyurethane is reported. The device is mechanically robust, effective in preventing cell entrance or escape, hydrophilic with facile mass transfer, and biocompatible with low levels of fibrotic deposition in mice, dogs, and pigs. These attributes make it an attractive candidate for safe delivery of insulin&#8208;producing cells to treat type 1 diabetes.








Abstract
Encapsulation of insulin&#8208;producing cells is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, engineering an encapsulation device that is both safe (i.e., no cell escape and no breakage) and functional (i.e., low foreign&#8208;body response (FBR) and high mass transfer) remains a challenge. Here, a family of zwitterionic polyurethanes (ZPU) with sulfobetaine groups in the polymer backbone is developed, which are fabricated into encapsulation devices with tunable nanoporous structures via electrospinning. The ZPU encapsulation device is hydrophilic and fouling&#8208;resistant, exhibits robust mechanical properties, and prevents cell escape while still allowing efficient mass transfer. The ZPU device also induces a much lower FBR or cellular overgrowth upon intraperitoneal implantation in C57BL/6 mice for up to 6 months compared to devices made of similar polyurethane without the zwitterionic modification. The therapeutic potential of the ZPU device is shown for islet encapsulation and diabetes correction in mice for &#8776;3 months is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the ZPU device in pigs and dogs are further demonstrated. Collectively, these attributes make ZPU devices attractive candidates for cell encapsulation therapies.

         <title>Dynamic Symmetry Breaking in Chiral Magnetic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in&#8208;plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in&#8208;plane field axis. Accounting for steady&#8208;state DW dynamics, the authors&#8217; model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries. These results expand the utility of DW motion in probing chiral magnetism.








Abstract
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic systems stabilizes spin textures with preferred chirality, applicable to next&#8208;generation memory and computing architectures. In perpendicularly magnetized heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet films, the interfacial DMI originating from structural inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling favors chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs) whose energetics and mobility remain at issue. Here, a new effect is characterized in which domains expand unidirectionally in response to a combination of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane magnetic fields, with the growth direction controlled by the in&#8208;plane field strength. These growth directionalities and symmetries with applied fields cannot be understood from static treatments alone. The authors theoretically demonstrate that perpendicular field torques stabilize steady&#8208;state magnetization profiles highly asymmetric in elastic energy, resulting in a dynamic symmetry breaking consistent with the experimental findings. This phenomenon sheds light on the mechanisms governing the dynamics of N&#233;el&#8208;type DWs and expands the utility of field&#8208;driven DW motion to probe and control chiral DWs.

         <title>Micropatterns Fabricated by Photodimerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns on film surfaces is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and mass transport of maleimide. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in microfluidic channels, composite gratings, devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Pattern technology plays an important role in the generation of microstructures with different functionalities and morphologies. In this report, a straightforward and versatile strategy is presented for spatially regulating the growth of a microstructure on a surface by the photodimerization of maleimide (MI). Upon exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, photodimerization of MI in a film comprising furan&#8208;grafted polymer and bismaleimide (BMI) produces a chemical gradient, which can drive the diffusion of BMI from the unexposed to the exposed region and from the bottom to the surface, resulting in the growth of micropatterns. Sequential crosslinking induced by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between MI and furan maintains the stability of pattern shape. Theoretical modeling with reaction&#8208;diffusion equations reveal that as photodimerization moves the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the formation of a chemical potential gradient requires the redistribution of matter, resulting in the formation of topographies. Directional molecular motion induced by UV light can generate complex morphology, and produce materials with unique optical functions, such as charming&#8208;ordered gratings.

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns on film surfaces is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and mass transport of maleimide. This technology integrates the characteristics of top-down and bottom-up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in microfluidic channels, composite gratings, devices, and functional systems.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern technology plays an important role in the generation of microstructures with different functionalities and morphologies. In this report, a straightforward and versatile strategy is presented for spatially regulating the growth of a microstructure on a surface by the photodimerization of maleimide (MI). Upon exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, photodimerization of MI in a film comprising furan-grafted polymer and bismaleimide (BMI) produces a chemical gradient, which can drive the diffusion of BMI from the unexposed to the exposed region and from the bottom to the surface, resulting in the growth of micropatterns. Sequential crosslinking induced by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between MI and furan maintains the stability of pattern shape. Theoretical modeling with reaction-diffusion equations reveal that as photodimerization moves the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the formation of a chemical potential gradient requires the redistribution of matter, resulting in the formation of topographies. Directional molecular motion induced by UV light can generate complex morphology, and produce materials with unique optical functions, such as charming-ordered gratings. This straightforward method of fabricating micropatterns by photodimerization-induced diffusion is successfully applied to patterned curved surfaces, microfluidic channels and encapsulation of integrated light emitting diode chips.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in Crystalline Solids: How Does It Collapse?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding in solids is shown to differ significantly from covalent bonding, as demonstrated by pronounced property changes for optical, vibrational, electronic, and structural properties upon the transition from covalent to metavalent bonding. This insight and the resulting map showing trends in chemical bonding and material properties can be used to design and tailor materials.








Abstract
The chemical bond is one of the most powerful, yet much debated concepts in chemistry, explaining property trends in solids. Recently, a novel type of chemical bonding was&#160;identified in several higher chalcogenides, characterized by a unique property portfolio, unconventional bond breaking, and sharing of about one electron between adjacent atoms. This metavalent bond is a fundamental type of bonding in solids, besides covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, raising the pertinent question as to whether there is a well&#8208;defined transition between metavalent and covalent bonds. Here, three different pseudo&#8208;binary lines, namely, GeTe1&#8722;xSex, Sb2Te3(1&#8722;x)Se3x, and Bi2&#8722;2xSb2xSe3, are studied, and a sudden change in several properties, including optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, Born effective charge Z*, electrical conductivity, as well as bond breaking behavior for a critical Se or Sb concentration, is evidenced. These findings provide a blueprint to experimentally explore the influence of metavalent bonding on attractive properties of phase&#8208;change materials and thermoelectrics. Particularly important is its impact on optical properties, which can be tailored by the amount of electrons shared between adjacent atoms. This correlation can be used to design optoelectronic materials and to explore systematic changes in chemical bonding with stoichiometry and atomic arrangement.

         <title>A Sustainable and Flexible Microbrush&#8208;Faced Triboelectric Generator for Portable/Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbrush&#8208;faced triboelectric nanogenerator featuring high robustness, outstanding sustainability, and excellent durability displays remarkable capability for mechanical energy harvesting in separate working modes. Human&#8208;being&#8208;interactive triboelectrification with this device reveals outstanding power generation and durability, suggesting that it can serve as a power source for various types of handheld electronics.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are put forward as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy&#8208;scavenging technology for self&#8208;powered electronics, but their severe wear and degradation driven by inevitable friction can pose significant durability and sustainability concerns. Here, an array of microfibers is reported that functions as a robust and sustainable TENG in both in&#8208;plane sliding and vertical contact&#8208;separation modes, with excellent electrical potential as high as 20&#160;V and a high cyclability of 3000. The design flexibility of this microbrush TENG (MB&#8208;TENG) on the counter materials facilitates the further improvement of electrical outputs, benefiting numerous applications of human&#8208;interactive triboelectrification. Significantly, these MB&#8208;TENGs offer sufficient output power for successfully driving a smartwatch as well as an electromyography module. This technology uses a simple and cost&#8208;effective manner to provide a robust and reliable monolithic TENG module, which is expected to serve as a promising energy&#8208;harvesting source for self&#8208;powered electronics in the near future.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Tumor&#8208;Penetrating and Oligomeric Nanozyme Based on Intrinsically Self&#8208;Assembling Protein Nanocages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains challenging to precisely control and reproducibly formulate nanomedicines. A nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy is established for tailoring oligomeric nanostructures and a series of artificial metalloenzymes in a precisely controlled manner, which offers an option for tailored anticancer nanomedicines that have a high degree of control over both geometry and valency.








Abstract
Biomimetic design of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics has emerged as a promising method for the generation of novel therapeutics. However, synthesis of nanomaterials while maintaining a high degree of control over both geometry and valency poses a prominent challenge. Herein, the authors introduce a nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy for accurate and quantitative tailoring of high&#8208;ordered nanostructures that uses a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; hierarchical incorporation of protein building blocks. The assembled nano&#8208;oligomers possessed tunable protein motifs and multivalent binding domains, which facilitated prolonged blood circulation time, accumulation within tumor cells through direct targeting of cell receptors, and deep tumor tissue penetration via a transcytosis mechanism. Using these protein/protein nano&#8208;oligomers as scaffolds, the authors created a new series of artificial nano&#8208;scaled metalloenzymes (nanozymes) by the in situ incorporation of metal nanoclusters within the cavity of the protein nanocages. Nanozymes were&#160;capable of mimicking peroxidase&#8208;like activity and generated cytotoxic free radicals. Compared to nanozyme alone, the systemic delivery of oligomeric nanozymes demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic and anti&#8208;tumor benefits. This study shows a new insight into nanotechnology by taking advantage of synthetic biotechnology.

         <title>Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane Ordered Laminate Borides and Their 2D Ti&#8208;Based Derivative from Chemical Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemical order in the layered T2 phase Ti4MoSiB2 (o&#8208;MAB) is theoretically predicted and experimentally verified. Chemical exfoliation of the compound is shown by derivation of a 2D material, TiOxCly. The 2D sheets have a direct band gap of &#8776;4.1&#160;eV and display characteristics suitable for supercapacitor applications.








Abstract
Exploratory theoretical predictions in uncharted structural and compositional space are integral to materials discoveries. Inspired by M5SiB2 (T2) phases, the finding of a family of laminated quaternary metal borides, M&#8242;4M&#8243;SiB2, with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemical order is reported here. 11 chemically ordered phases as well as 40 solid solutions, introducing four elements previously not observed in these borides are predicted. The predictions are experimentally verified for Ti4MoSiB2, establishing Ti as part of the T2 boride compositional space. Chemical exfoliation of Ti4MoSiB2 and select removal of Si and MoB2 sub&#8208;layers is validated by derivation of a 2D material, TiOxCly, of high yield and in the form of delaminated sheets. These sheets have an experimentally determined direct band gap of &#8776;4.1&#160;eV, and display characteristics suitable for supercapacitor applications. The results take the concept of chemical exfoliation beyond currently available 2D materials, and expands the envelope of 3D and 2D candidates, and their applications.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Hydrophobicity Transformation, Thermoresponsive Morphomechanics, and Crack Multifurcation Revealed by AIEgens in Mechanically Strong Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation has been achieved in a facile, high&#8208;contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as fluorescent indicators. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical study, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed.








Abstract
Biomimetic exploration of stimuli&#8208;responsive and crack&#8208;resistant hydrogels is of great academic and practical significance, although the rational design of tough hydrogels is limited by insufficient mechanism study due to the lack of imaging techniques to &#8220;see&#8221; hydrogels at mesoscale level. A series of composite hydrogels with compartmentalized thermal response is designed by incorporating aggregation&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes in a poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network grafted with poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) side&#8208;chains. The fluorescence technique is explored as a powerful tool to directly visualize their hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation and the composition&#8208;dependent microphase separation. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of multiple noncovalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack multifurcation is related to the tearing&#8208;like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.

         <title>Rational Design of a High Performance and Robust Solar Evaporator via 3D&#8208;Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed solar evaporator using the double layered photoabsorber on a concave shaped 3D&#8208;printed supporter improves the light harvesting capacity by reutilizing reflected light and prevents the salt deposition due to hydrophobic upper layer of the photoabsorber, meanwhile the hydrophilic bottom layer continuously pumps the water. As a result, the rationally designed solar evaporator exhibits an outstanding evaporation performance.








Abstract
Utilizing the broad&#8208;band solar spectrum for sea water desalination is a promising method that can provide fresh water without sophisticated infrastructures. However, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapour efficiency has been limited due to the lack of a proper design for the evaporator to deal with either a large amount of heat loss or salt accumulation. Here, these issues are addressed via two cost&#8208;effective approaches: I) a rational design of a concave shaped supporter by 3D&#8208;printing that can promote the light harvesting capacity via multiple reflections on the surface; II) the use of a double layered photoabsorber composed of a hydrophilic bottom layer of a polydopamine (PDA) coated glass fiber (GF/C) and a hydrophobic upper layer of a carbonized poly(vinyl alcohol)/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVA/PVP) hydrogel on the supporter, which provides competitive benefit for preventing deposition of salt while quickly pumping the water. The 3D&#8208;printed solar evaporator can efficiently utilize solar energy (99%) with an evaporation rate of 1.60 kg m&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 and efficiency of 89% under 1 sun irradiation. The underlying reason for the high efficiency obtained is supported by the heat transfer mechanism. The 3D&#8208;printed solar evaporator could provide cheap drinking water in remote areas, while maintaining stable performance for a long term.

         <title>Marked Passivation Effect of Naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;Dicarboximides in High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaromatic passivator 4&#8208;hydroxybiphenyl substituted naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide provides chemical passivation (protonic/Lewis&#8208;base groups system) and energetic passivation (creating benign midgap states) effects. The Lewis&#8208;base/polyaromatic conjugation/protonic system reduces defects efficiently and avoids superoxide anions in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
As game&#8208;changers in the photovoltaic community, perovskite solar cells are making unprecedented progress while still facing grand challenges such as improving lifetime without impairing efficiency. Herein, two structurally alike polyaromatic molecules based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI) and perylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI) with different molecular dipoles are applied to tackle this issue. Contrasting the electronically pull&#8211;pull cyanide&#8208;substituted PMI (9CN&#8208;PMI) with only Lewis&#8208;base groups, the push&#8211;pull 4&#8208;hydroxybiphenyl&#8208;substituted NMI (4OH&#8208;NMI) with both protonic and Lewis&#8208;base groups can provide better chemical passivation for both shallow&#8208; and deep&#8208;level defects. Moreover, combined theoretical and experimental studies show that the 4OH&#8208;NMI can bind more firmly with perovskite and the polyaromatic backbones create benign midgap states in the excited perovskite to suppress the damage by superoxide anions (energetic passivation). The polar and protonic nature of 4OH&#8208;NMI facilitates band alignment and regulates the viscosity of the precursor solution for thicker perovskite films with better morphology. Consequently, the 4OH&#8208;NMI&#8208;passivated perovskite films exhibit reduced grain boundaries and nearly three&#8208;times lower defect density, boosting the device efficiency to 23.7%. A more effective design of the passivator for perovskites with multi&#8208;passivation mechanisms is provided in this study.

         <title>In Situ Tumor Vaccination with Nanoparticle Co&#8208;Delivering CpG and STAT3 siRNA to Effectively Induce Whole&#8208;Body Antitumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors (AIRISE&#8208;02) is a nano&#8208;immunotherapeutic candidate that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA to a local tumor, generating anti&#8208;tumor immune response against cancer everywhere in the body (both treated and untreated tumors). Combination of AIRISE&#8208;02 and standard immune checkpoint inhibitors cures 63% of mice with melanoma tumors, while the inhibitors alone cure none.








Abstract
The success of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a subset of individuals has been very exciting. However, in many cancers, responses to current ICIs are modest and are seen only in a small subsets of patients. Herein, a widely applicable approach that increases the benefit of ICIs is reported. Intratumoral administration of augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors&#8212;AIRISE&#8208;02 nanotherapeutic that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA&#8212;results in not only regression of the injected tumor, but also tumors at distant sites in multiple tumor model systems. In particular, three doses of AIRISE&#8208;02 in combination with systemic ICIs completely cure both treated and untreated aggressive melanoma tumors in 63% of mice, while ICIs alone do not cure any mice. A long&#8208;term memory immune effect is also reported. AIRISE&#8208;02 is effective in breast and colon tumor models as well. Lastly, AIRISE&#8208;02 is well tolerated in mice and nonhuman primates. This approach combines multiple therapeutic agents into a single nanoconstruct to create whole&#8208;body immune responses across multiple cancer types. Being a local therapeutic, AIRISE&#8208;02 circumvents regulatory challenges of systemic nanoparticle delivery, facilitating rapid translation to the clinic. AIRISE&#8208;02 is under investigational new drug (IND)&#8208;enabling studies, and clinical trials will soon follow.

         <title>Manipulating Ferromagnetism in Few&#8208;Layered Cr2Ge2Te6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ionic conductors as the gate dielectric, the easy&#8208;axis of the ferromagnetism of Cr2Ge2Te6 thin flakes can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to the in&#8208;plane direction by an electric field, coinciding with a significant increase of the Curie temperature. The surface of the sample is fully exposed in this type of devices, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible.








Abstract
The discovery of magnetism in 2D materials offers new opportunities for exploring novel quantum states and developing spintronic devices. In this work, using field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ion conductors as the gate dielectric (SIC&#8208;FETs), we&#160;have observed a significant enhancement of ferromagnetism associated with magnetic easy&#8208;axis switching in few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. The easy axis of the magnetization, inferred from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to an in&#8208;plane direction by electric field in the few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. Additionally, the Curie temperature, obtained from both the Hall resistance and magnetoresistance measurements, increases from 65 to 180 K in the few&#8208;layered sample by electric gating. Moreover, the surface of the sample is fully exposed in the SIC&#8208;FET device configuration, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible. This work offers an excellent platform for realizing electrically controlled quantum phenomena in a single device.

&lt;p&gt;In field-effect transistors with solid ionic conductors as the gate dielectric, the easy-axis of the ferromagnetism of Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; thin flakes can be uniformly tuned from the out-of-plane direction to the in-plane direction by an electric field, coinciding with a significant increase of the Curie temperature.

         <title>2D High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide alloys containing 4 or 5 transition metals are synthesized based on first&#8208;principles stability predictions. The 5&#8208;component alloy (MoWVNbTa)S2 is shown to be an excellent electrocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 into CO. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that a small concentration of highly active sites is responsible for the high activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys combine multiple principal elements at a near equal fraction to form vast compositional spaces to achieve outstanding functionalities that are absent in alloys with one or two principal elements. Here, the prediction, synthesis, and multiscale characterization of 2D high&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) alloys with four/five transition metals is reported. Of these, the electrochemical performance of a five&#8208;component alloy with the highest configurational entropy, (MoWVNbTa)S2, is investigated for CO2 conversion to CO, revealing an excellent current density of 0.51 A cm&#8722;2 and a turnover frequency of 58.3 s&#8722;1 at &#8776; &#8722;0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the superior CO2 electroreduction is due to a multi&#8208;site catalysis wherein the atomic&#8208;scale disorder optimizes the rate&#8208;limiting step of CO desorption by facilitating isolated transition metal edge sites with weak CO binding. 2D high&#8208;entropy TMDC alloys provide a materials platform to design superior catalysts for many electrochemical systems.

         <title>Powering Electronic Devices from Salt Gradients in AA&#8208;Battery&#8208;Sized Stacks of Hydrogel&#8208;Infused Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most powerful electric fish, the Atlantic torpedo ray, uses sheet&#8208;like electrically active cells within its electric organs to produce external electrical discharges of up to 1&#160;kW. A paper&#8208;based artificial electric organ is presented, which mimics the torpedo strategies for optimal power generation, resulting in a small and potentially biocompatible energy&#8208;storage device capable of operating real&#8208;world electronics.








Abstract
Strongly electric fish use gradients of ions within their bodies to generate stunning external electrical discharges; the most powerful of these organisms, the Atlantic torpedo ray, can produce pulses of over 1&#160;kW from its electric organs. Despite extensive study of this phenomenon in nature, the development of artificial power generation schemes based on ion gradients for portable, wearable, or implantable human use has remained out of reach. Previously, an artificial electric organ inspired by the electric eel demonstrated that electricity generated from ion gradients within stacked hydrogels can exceed 100&#160;V. The current of this power source, however, was&#160;too low to power standard electronics. Here, an artificial electric organ inspired by the unique morphologies of torpedo rays for maximal current output is introduced. This power source uses a hybrid material of hydrogel&#8208;infused paper to create, organize, and reconfigure stacks of thin, arbitrarily large gel films in series and in parallel. The resulting increase in electrical power by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the original eel&#8208;inspired design makes it possible to power electronic devices and establishes that biology's mechanism of generating significant electrical power can now be realized from benign and soft materials in a portable size.

         <title>Construction of Supercapacitor&#8208;Based Ionic Diodes with Adjustable Bias Directions by Using Poly(ionic liquid) Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;regulation strategy to design bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable supercapacitor&#8208;diodes is demonstrated. Such multifunctional devices show excellent charge&#8208;storage performance and rectification performance, which fills a gap in the current capacitive ionic diodes.








Abstract
The newly emerging supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode), integrating the characteristics of a diode into an electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor, can be employed to extend conventional supercapacitors to new technological applications and may play a crucial role in grid stabilization, signal propagation, and logic operations. However, the reported CAPodes have only been able to realize charge storage in the positive&#8208;bias direction. Here, bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable CAPodes realized by using a polycation&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) or a polyanion&#8208;based IL as electrolyte in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;based supercapacitor architecture are proposed. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage function at only the positive&#8208; or negative&#8208;bias direction with a high rectification ratio (&#8776;80% for rectification ratio II, RRII) and an outstanding cycling life (4500 cycles), representing a crucial breakthrough for designing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>Transparent Omni&#8208;Directional Stretchable Circuit Lines Made by a Junction&#8208;Free Grid of Expandable Au Lines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to fabricate omni&#8208;directional stretchable gold (Au) circuit lines with high transparency, high electrical conductivity, and negligible resistance change is presented. Metals are deposited directly over the crack&#8208;controlled poly(dimethylsiloxane) surface forming grid inside the cracks. This study demonstrates a highly transparent, stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode with a patterned Au line circuit board.








Abstract
Although various stretchable optoelectronic devices have been reported, omni&#8208;directionally stretchable transparent circuit lines have been a great challenge. Cracks are engineered and fabricated to be highly conductive patterned metal circuit lines in which gold (Au) grids are embedded. Au is deposited selectively in the cracks to form a grid without any junction between the grid lines. Since each grid line is expandable under stretching, the circuit lines are stretchable in all the directions. This study shows that a thin coating of aluminum on the oxide surface enables precise control of the cracks (crack density, crack depth) in the oxide layer. High optical transparency and high stretchability can be achieved simultaneously by controlling the grid density in the circuit line. Light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated directly on the circuit lines and stable operation is demonstrated under 100% stretching.

         <title>Synthesis of a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Perovskite SmTiO2N Bifunctional Photocatalyst via an Evaporation&#8208;Assisted Layered&#8208;Precursor Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
A new n&#8208;type perovskite SmTiO2N photocatalyst with a bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV is synthesized to show functionalities of both water reduction and oxidation under visible light, whose success is ascribed to the development of an evaporation&#8208;assisted layered&#8208;precursor strategy that is of generality for synthesis of other oxynitrides.








Abstract
Development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive oxynitride photocatalysts has been highly inspired for promising solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, but the number of Ti&#8208;based oxynitrides is scarce because of the relatively low thermal stability of Ti4+ ions under ammonia flow. Here, the feasible synthesis of a novel perovskite SmTiO2N from the layered NaSmTiO4 precursor is demonstrated to exhibit wide visible&#8208;light response with a bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV and to show effective water reduction and oxidation functionalities under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The successful preparation mainly results from the synergistic effect of the layered structure of NaSmTiO4 and the evaporation spillover of Na+ ions, both of which are favorable for ammonia diffusion to accelerate the substitution of nitrogen to oxygen atoms and to shorten the nitridation time. The thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility of SmTiO2N for water splitting are investigated in detail, and its optimal apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of water oxidation reaches 16.7% at 420&#160;&#177;&#160;10&#160;nm, higher by far than that of most previous visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts. Interestingly, a series of oxynitrides RTiO2N (R = La, Pr, Nd) are similarly synthesized by the alkali&#8208;metal evaporation&#8208;assisted layered&#8208;precursor strategy, demonstrating its generality to prepare visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive (oxy)nitride photocatalysts containing reducible metals for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Emulsion&#8208;Guided Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Particles: Droplet Size Determines Particle Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of a series of novel anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) using an emulsion&#8208;templating method is described. The geometry of the APPs is determined by the average size of the oil droplets, based on a new mechanism. The APPs can be converted to anisotropic carbon particles with their architectures, which can be used as electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
Anisotropic particles have attracted significant attention due to their alluring features that distinguish them from isotropic particles. One of the most appealing strategies for the synthesis of anisotropic particles is the emulsion&#8208;guided method. However, morphological control and the understanding of formation mechanisms have remained a major challenge. Based on a novel mechanism, here, a facile one&#8208;pot emulsion&#8208;templating method for the tunable construction of anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) with different defined structures is reported. Three types of monocomponent APPs with new morphologies and sizes in the range of 240&#8211;650&#160;nm, including Janus mushroom&#8208;like mesoporous poly(m&#8208;phenylenediamine) (PmPD) particles, wheel&#8208;shaped particles, and acorn&#8208;like PmPD particles, are obtained by controlling the average size of the oil droplets in the emulsion. Furthermore, the APPs demonstrate the ability for conversion to nitrogen&#8208;doped anisotropic carbon particles (ACPs) by pyrolysis at 800&#160;&#176;C under a N2 atmosphere, thereby inheriting their structures. These novel ACPs show appreciable potential as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for use in oxygen reduction reactions. Compared to their isotropic counterpart, these ACPs exhibit remarkable advantages such as enhanced specific surface area and pore volume, reduced stacking density, and easy fabrication of continuous and uniform membrane electrodes.

         <title>A Full&#8208;Spectrum Porphyrin&#8211;Fullerene D&#8211;A Supramolecular Photocatalyst with Giant Built&#8208;In Electric Field for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;spectrum responsive donor&#8211;acceptor supramolecular photocatalyst TPPS/C60 is successfully constructed. The theoretical spectral efficiency of TPPS/C60 is as high as 70%. The TPPS/C60 performs with a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 34.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing many reported organic photocatalysts. The D&#8211;A structure and the giant internal electric field dramatically promote the charge separation.








Abstract
A full&#8208;spectrum (300&#8211;850&#160;nm) responsive donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) supramolecular photocatalyst tetraphenylporphinesulfonate/fullerene (TPPS/C60) is successfully constructed. The theoretical spectral efficiency of TPPS/C60 is as high as 70%, offering the possibility of full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. The TPPS/C60 performs a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 276.55&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (34.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), surpassing many reported organic photocatalysts. The D&#8211;A structure effectively promotes electron transfer from TPPS to C60, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction. Specifically, a giant internal electric field in the D&#8211;A structure is built via the enhanced molecular dipole, which dramatically promotes the charge separation (CS) efficiency by 2.35 times. Transient absorption spectra results show a long&#8208;lived CS state TPPS&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8722; in the D&#8211;A structure, which effectively promotes participation of photogenerated electrons in the reduction reaction. Briefly, this work provides a novel approach for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic materials via enhancing the interfacial electric field.

         <title>Orthorhombic Cobalt Ditelluride with Te Vacancy Defects Anchoring on Elastic MXene Enables Efficient Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) are successfully fabricated to enhance performance in potassium storage. The o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode displays extraordinary structural stability, superior reversible capacity, exceptional rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability, as well as reliable operation in flexible advanced potassium&#8208;ion full batteries.








Abstract
The fast and reversible potassiation/depotassiation of anode materials remains an elusive yet intriguing goal. Herein, a class of the P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires with Te vacancy defects supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) is designed and prepared, taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the conductive o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2 arrays with rich Te vacancy defects and the elastic MXene sheets with self&#8208;autoadjustable function. Consequently, the o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene superstructure exhibits boosted potassium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of high reversible capacity (373.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles), remarkable rate capability (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cyclability (0.011% capacity decay per cycle over 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1), representing the best performance in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenides&#8208;based anodes to date. Impressively, the flexible full battery with o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode achieves a satisfying energy density of 275&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high bending stability. The kinetics analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal superior pseudocapacitive property, high electronic conductivity, and favorable K+ ion adsorption and diffusion capability, corroborating fast K+ ion storage. Especially, ex situ characterizations confirm o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene undergoes reversible evolutions of initially proceeding with the K+ ion insertion, followed by the conversion reaction mechanism.

Especially, ex situ characterizations confirm &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-P-CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MXene undergoes reversible evolutions of initially proceeding with the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion insertion, followed by the conversion reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Construction of Aramid Engineering Materials via Polymerization&#8208;Induced para&#8208;Aramid Nanofiber Hydrogel</title>

A simple &#8220;monomers&#8211;nanofibers&#8211;macroscopic product&#8221; hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach for the preparation of all&#8208;aramid bulk and honeycomb materials, which are difficult to process in traditional ways, is demonstrated. These products show excellent mechanical and thermal performance. This work is a breakthrough for the processing of high&#8208;performance engineering polymer material, and the industrialization prospect of all&#8208;aramid products deserves further study.








Abstract
The processing of poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) has long been a great challenge. This work reports a simple &#8220;monomers&#8208;nanofibers&#8208;macroscopic product&#8221; (MNM) hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach to build 3D&#160;all&#8208;PPTA engineering materials. This approach mainly includes the preparation of polymerization&#8208;induced aramid nanofibers (PANFs) from monomers and the fabrication of all&#8208;PPTA materials from PANF hydrogel. Various 3D architectures, including simple solid bulks and sophisticated honeycombs (HCs), are obtained after the dehydration and shrinking of the PANF hydrogel. The tensile strength and compressive yield strength of PANF bulk are more than 62 and 90&#160;MPa, respectively, which are comparable to typical engineering plastics. The compressive strength of PANF HC with a density of 360&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;3 is more than 24&#160;MPa. The thermal stability of PANF bulk and PANF HC are as good as that of Kevlar fiber and almost no decomposition occurred before 500&#160;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Furthermore, the MNM process is performed under mild conditions, without high temperature, high pressure, or corrosive solvent. The MNM process is a novel strategy for the processing of all aromatic polyamide materials with complex structures and high performances and would be another development since the breakthrough of liquid crystal spinning technology of PPTA.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atomic Iron&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Integrated 3D&#8208;Printed Bioscaffolds for Osteosarcoma Destruction with Antibacterial and Bone Defect Regeneration Bioactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atomic&#8208;catalyst&#8208;engineered 3D scaffolds for osteosarcoma therapy and bone regeneration are reported. A single&#8208;atomic iron catalyst with highly effective hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced catalytic radical generating activities is engineered into a 3D&#8208;printed bioglass scaffold to achieve comprehensive osteosarcoma elimination, antibacterial properties, and bone defect regeneration with biocompatibility.








Abstract
Effective antitumor therapeutics with distinctive bactericidal and osteogenic properties are in high demand for comprehensive osteosarcoma treatment. Here, a &#8220;scaffold engineering&#8221; strategy that integrates highly active single&#8208;atomic iron catalysts (FeSAC) into a 3D printed bioactive glass (BG) scaffold is reported. Based on the atomically dispersed iron species within the catalysts, the engineered FeSAC displays prominent Fenton catalytic activity to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) in response to the microenvironment specific to osteosarcoma. In addition, the constructed FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold can serve as a sophisticated biomaterial platform for efficient osteosarcoma ablation, with concomitant bacterial sterilization via localized hyperthermia&#8208;reinforced nanocatalytic therapeutics. The destruction of the osteosarcoma, as well as the bacterial foci, can be achieved, further preventing susceptible chronic osteomyelitis during osteogenesis. In particular, the engineered FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold is identified with advances in accelerated osteoconduction and osteoinduction, ultimately contributing to the sophisticated therapeutics and management of osteosarcoma. This work broadens the biomedical potential of single&#8208;atom catalysts and offers a comprehensive clinically feasible strategy for overall osteosarcoma therapeutics, bacterial inhibition, and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Nanotexture Shape and Surface Energy Impact on Electroadhesive Human&#8211;Machine Interface Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroadhesion&#8208;based haptics technology has received substantial attention in recent years and has seen a rapidly expanding inclusion in current ubiquitous interactive touch surfaces. This work studies the underlying multiphysics mechanism at the nanoasperity level and provides a novel insight for the design and optimization of future electroadhesive finger&#8211;device interfaces for higher efficiency and reduced variability.








Abstract
With the ubiquity of touch screens and the commercialization of electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices, modeling tools that capture the multiphysical phenomena within the finger&#8211;device interface and their interaction are critical to design devices that achieve higher performance and reliability at lower cost. While electroadhesion has successfully demonstrated the capability to change tactile perception through friction modulation, the mechanism of electroadhesion in the finger&#8211;device interface is still unclear, partly due to the complex interfacial physics including contact deformation, capillary formation, electric field, and their complicated coupling effects that have not been addressed comprehensively. A multiphysics model is presented here to predict the friction force for finger&#8211;surface tactile interactions at the nanoscale. The nanoscopic multiphysical phenomena are coupled to study the impacts of nanotexture and surface energy in the touch interface. With macroscopic friction force measurements as verification, the model is further used to propose textures that have maximum electroadhesion effect and minimum sensitivity to relative humidity and user perspiration rate. This model can guide the performance improvement of future electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices and other touch&#8208;based human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Photoluminescence of Fully Inorganic Colloidal Gold Nanocluster and Their Manipulation Using Surface Charge Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size&#8208;controlled generation of fully inorganic gold nanoclusters is demonstrated by a modern laser&#8208;based synthesis method. These colloidal species exhibit a bright blue photoluminescence, for which the intensity is a direct function of the surface charge density adjustable by the pH of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, these particles offer the opportunity to dedicate photoluminescence to core and surface state transitions.








Abstract
Fully inorganic, colloidal gold nanoclusters (NCs) constitute a new class of nanomaterials that are clearly distinguishable from their commonly studied metal&#8211;organic ligand&#8208;capped counterparts. As their synthesis by chemical methods is challenging, details about their optical properties remain widely unknown. In this work, laser fragmentation in liquids is performed to produce fully inorganic and size&#8208;controlled colloidal gold NCs with monomodal particle size distributions and an fcc&#8208;like structure. Results reveal that these NCs exhibit highly pronounced photoluminescence with quantum yields of 2%. The emission behavior of small (2&#8211;2.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall (&lt;1&#160;nm) NCs is significantly different and dominated by either core&#8208; or surface&#8208;based emission states. It is further verified that emission intensities are a function of the surface charge density, which is easily controllable by the pH of the surrounding medium. This experimentally observed correlation between surface charge and photoluminescence emission intensity is confirmed by density functional theoretical simulations, demonstrating that fully inorganic NCs provide an appropriate material to bridge the gap between experimental and computational studies of NCs. The presented study deepens the understanding of electronic structures in fully inorganic colloidal gold NCs and how to systematically tune their optical properties via surface charge density and particle size.

         <title>Facet Engineering to Regulate Surface States of Topological Crystalline Insulator Bismuth Rhombic Dodecahedrons for Highly Energy Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological surface states and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap of Bi rhombic dodecahedrons facilitate highly selective formate production in a wide current density range, leading to a high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (maximum value of 69.5%) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This electrocatalyst can potentially be used for intermittent energy storage.








Abstract
Bismuth (Bi) is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI), which has gapless topological surface states (TSSs) protected by a specific crystalline symmetry that strongly depends on the facet. Bi is also a promising electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) electrocatalyst for formate production. In this study, single&#8208;crystalline Bi rhombic dodecahedrons (RDs) exposed with (104) and (110) facets are developed. The Bi RDs demonstrate a very low overpotential and high selectivity for formate production (Faradic efficiency &gt;92.2%)&#160;in a wide partial current density range from 9.8 to 290.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, leading to a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (69.5%) for ECO2RR. The significantly reduced overpotential is caused by the enhanced *OCHO adsorption on the Bi RDs. The high selectivity of formate can be ascribed to the TSSs and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap on Bi RDs, which strengthens and stabilizes the preferentially adsorbed *OCHO and mitigates the competing adsorption of *H during ECO2RR. This study describes a promising application of Bi RDs for high&#8208;rate formate production and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage of intermittent renewable electricity. Optimizing the geometry of TCIs is also proposed as an effective strategy to tune the TSSs of topological catalysts.

         <title>Crowning Metal Ions by Supramolecularization as a General Remedy toward a Dendrite&#8208;Free Alkali&#8208;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general supramolecularization strategy with size&#8208;matching crown ethers is proposed to protect alkali&#8208;metal anodes (Li, Na, and K). The unique electrostatic shielding layer and organic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) induced by the crown ether&#8211;Li+/Na+/K+ assembly effectively inhibit the growth of alkali&#8208;metal dendrites and largely improve the lifespan of alkali&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Alkali metals have low potentials and high capacities, making them ideal anodes for next&#8208;generation batteries, but they suffer major problems, including dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency (CE). Achieving uniform metal deposition and having a reliable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are the basic requirements for overcoming these problems. Here, a general remedy is reported for various alkali&#8208;metal anodes by the supramolecularization of alkali&#8208;metal cations with crown ethers that follows a size&#8208;matching rule. The positively charged supramolecular complex provides electrostatic shielding layers to regulate metal deposition and suppress dendrite formation. More promisingly, it reforms electric double layers and drives the production of organic&#8208;dominated SEIs with improved flexibility that can accommodate large volume changes. The high flexibility of SEIs during metal deposition and dissolution reduces the amount of dead metal and improves CE and cycling stability. Specifically, a 200% excess Li&#8208;based full cell has a capacity retention of &#8776;100% after 100 cycles. This crown&#8208;like supramolecularization strategy is a new chemistry that may be used for the production of dendrite&#8208;free metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries not limited to the cases with alkali metal. It is also expected as a practical technology to improve the uniformity of coatings produced in the electrodeposition industry.

         <title>Phase Coexistence and Structural Dynamics of Redox Metal Catalysts Revealed by Operando TEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical dynamics (characterized by phase coexistence and oscillatory phase transition) of redox metal catalysts and their relevance to catalytic activity are revealed by operando transmission electron microscopy. This work underlines the importance of chemical dynamics and provides a convenient mechanism for the formation and constant regeneration of transient active sites during catalysis.








Abstract
Metal catalysts play an important role in industrial redox reactions. Although extensively studied, the state of these catalysts under operating conditions is largely unknown, and assignments of active sites remain speculative. Herein, an operando transmission electron microscopy study is presented, which interrelates the structural dynamics of redox metal catalysts to their activity. Using hydrogen oxidation on copper as an elementary redox reaction, it is revealed how the interaction between metal and the surrounding gas phase induces complex structural transformations and drives the system from a thermodynamic equilibrium toward a state controlled by the chemical dynamics. Direct imaging combined with the simultaneous detection of catalytic activity provides unparalleled structure&#8211;activity insights that identify distinct mechanisms for water formation and reveal the means by which the system self&#8208;adjusts to changes of the gas&#8208;phase chemical potential. Density functional theory calculations show that surface phase transitions are driven by chemical dynamics even when the system is far from a thermodynamic phase boundary. In a bottom&#8208;up approach, the dynamic behavior observed here for an elementary reaction is finally extended to more relevant redox reactions and other metal catalysts, which underlines the importance of chemical dynamics for the formation and constant re&#8208;generation of transient active sites during catalysis.

         <title>Harvesting Cool Daylight in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Halides Microtubules through the Reservation of Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
After pressure processing, the quenched products possess unexpected intense emission exceeding ten times that of the initial state, accompanied by efficient color temperature tuning from weak sky blue to very bright cool daylight. The irreversible electronic transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules, is highly responsible for the eventual retention of pressure&#8208;induced emission.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is extensively studied in halide perovskites or derivative hybrid halides. However, owing to the soft inorganic lattice of these materials, the intense emission is barely retained under ambient conditions, thus largely limiting their practical applications in optoelectronics at atmospheric pressure. Here, remarkably enhanced emission in microtubules of the 0D hybrid halide (C5H7N2)2ZnBr4 ((4AMP)2ZnBr4) is successfully achieved by means of pressure treatment at room temperature. Notably, the emission, which is over ten times more intense than the emission in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon the complete release of pressure. Furthermore, the pressure processing enables the tuning of &#8220;sky blue light&#8221; before compression to &#8220;cool daylight&#8221; with a remarkable quantum yield of 88.52% after decompression, which is of considerable interest for applications in next&#8208;generation lighting and displays. The irreversible electronic structural transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules [4AMP], is highly responsible for the eventual retention of PIE and tuning of the color temperature. The findings represent a significant step toward the capture of PIE under ambient conditions, thus facilitating its potential solid&#8208;state lighting applications.

         <title>A Gas&#8208;Steamed MOF Route to P&#8208;Doped Open Carbon Cages with Enhanced Zn&#8208;Ion Energy Storage Capability and Ultrastability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just like steaming Chinese buns, a gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) approach is employed to prepare open&#8208;wall carbon cages while simultaneously offering N, P dopants functionalized into a carbon matrix within a one&#8208;step process. Taking the advantages of the fabricated carbon cages with controlled openings and N, P dopants, extraordinary Zn&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage performance is displayed.








Abstract
Carbon micro/nanocages have received great attention, especially in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a solid&#8208;state gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework approach is designed to fabricate carbon cages with controlled openings on walls, and N, P&#160;dopants. Taking advantage of the fabricated carbon cages with large openings on their walls for enhanced kinetics of mass transport and N, P dopants within the carbon matrix for favoring chemical adsorption of Zn ions, when used as carbon cathodes for advanced aqueous Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), such open carbon cages (OCCs) display a wide operation voltage of 2.0&#160;V and an enhanced capacity of 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Just like steaming Chinese buns, a gas-steamed metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) approach is employed to prepare open-wall carbon cages while simultaneously offering N, P dopants functionalized into a carbon matrix within a one-step process. Taking the advantages of the fabricated carbon cages with controlled openings and N, P dopants, extraordinary Zn-ion energy-storage performance is displayed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon micro/nanocages have received great attention, especially in electrochemical energy-storage systems. Herein, as a proof-of-concept, a solid-state gas-steamed metal&#8211;organic-framework approach is designed to fabricate carbon cages with controlled openings on walls, and N, P&#160;dopants. Taking advantage of the fabricated carbon cages with large openings on their walls for enhanced kinetics of mass transport and N, P dopants within the carbon matrix for favoring chemical adsorption of Zn ions, when used as carbon cathodes for advanced aqueous Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), such open carbon cages (OCCs) display a wide operation voltage of 2.0&#160;V and an enhanced capacity of 225 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, they exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of up to 300&#160;000 cycles with 96.5% capacity retention. Particularly, such OCCs as electrode materials lead to a soft-pack ZHSC device, delivering a high energy density of 97&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a superb power density of 6.5&#160;kW kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Further, the device can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;25 to + 40&#160;&#176;C, covering the temperatures for practical applications in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds as Versatile Reagents for Extremely Efficient and Reversible Patterning of Graphene with Nanoscale Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene are demonstrated by using hypervalent iodine compounds in combination with laser writing, realizing the first patterned hydroxylation as well as unprecedented degrees of patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation of graphene. The graphene patterning is completely reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over 2D chemical information on graphene.








Abstract
Rational patterning and tailoring of graphene relies on the disclosure of suitable reagents for structuring the target functionalities on the 2D&#8208;carbon network. Here, a series of hypervalent iodine compounds, namely, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxol&#8208;3(1H)&#8208;one, 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole, and 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole is reported to be extremely efficient for a diversified graphene patterning. The decomposition of these compounds generates highly reactive Cl, OH, and CF3 radicals exclusively in the irradiated areas, which subsequently attach onto the graphene leading to locally controlled chlorination, hydroxylation, and trifluoromethylation, respectively. This is the first realization of a patterned hydroxylation of graphene, and the degrees of functionalization of the patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation are both unprecedented. The usage of these mild reagents here is reasonably facile compared to the reported methods using hazardous Cl2 or ICl and allows for sophisticated pattern designs with nanoscale precision, promising for arbitrary nanomanipulation of graphene's properties like hydrophilicity and conductivity by the three distinct functionalities (Cl, OH, and CF3). Moreover, the attachment of functional entities to these highly functionalized graphene nanoarchitectures is fully reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling a full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over the chemical information stored within graphene. This work provides an exciting clue for target 2D functionalization and modulation of graphene by using suitable hypervalent iodine compounds.

         <title>Significant Performance Improvement in n&#8208;Channel Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with C60:C70 Co&#8208;Crystals Induced by Poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) Nanodots</title>

18&#8208;fold&#8208;enhanced electron mobility is achieved for n&#8208;channel organic field&#8208;effect transistors with co&#8208;crystalized C60:C70 blend films formed on nanodot&#8208;structured dipolar poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz) interlayers that also reduce the work function of the electrodes. The PEOz nanodot layers further deliver high spatial uniformity in electron mobility and enhance device stability for transistor array fabrication.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted great interest due to their potential as logic devices for bendable and flexible electronics. In relation to n&#8208;channel structures, soluble fullerene semiconductors have been widely studied. However, they have not yet met the essential requirements for commercialization, primarily because of low charge carrier mobility, immature large&#8208;scale fabrication processes, and insufficient long&#8208;term operational stability. Interfacial engineering of the carrier&#8208;injecting source/drain (S/D) electrodes has been proposed as an effective approach to improve charge injection, leading also to overall improved device characteristics. Here, it is demonstrated that a non&#8208;conjugated neutral dipolar polymer, poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz), formed as a nanodot structure on the S/D electrodes, enhances electron mobility in n&#8208;channel OFETs using a range of soluble fullerenes. Overall performance is especially notable for (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) and (C70&#8208;D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene (C70) blend films, with an increase from 0.1 to 2.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The high relative mobility and eighteen&#8208;fold improvement are attributed not only to the anticipated reduction in S/D electrode work function but also to the beneficial effects of PEOz on the formation of a face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic C60:C70 co&#8208;crystal structure within the blend films.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Activatable Dynamic Nanoparticles Boosting Ferroptotic Cell Death for Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable nanoparticles integrating dynamic covalent bonds are developed for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor RSL&#8208;3 and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Nanoparticle&#8208;based GPX4 inhibition and PDT significantly promote the ferroptotic death of tumor cells and activate the T&#8208;cell immune response for inhibiting tumor growth and suppressing distant metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy shows promising therapeutic potential for long&#8208;term tumor regression. However, current cancer immunotherapy displays a low response rate due to insufficient immunogenicity of the tumor cells. To address these challenges, herein, intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable dynamic nanoparticles for eliciting immunogenicity by inducing ferroptosis of the tumor cells are engineered. The nanoparticles are engineered by integrating an ionizable block copolymer and acid&#8208;liable phenylboronate ester (PBE) dynamic covalent bonds for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of the ferroptosis inducer, a glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor RSL&#8208;3. The nanoparticles can stably encapsulate RSL&#8208;3 inside the hydrophobic core via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction with the PBE groups at neutral pH (pH = 7.4), while releasing the payload in the endocytic vesicles (pH = 5.8&#8211;6.2) by acidity&#8208;triggered cleavage of the PBE dynamic covalent bonds. Furthermore, the nanoparticles can perform acid&#8208;activatable photodynamic therapy&#160;by protonation of the ionizable core, and significantly recruit tumor&#8208;infiltrating T lymphocytes for interferon gamma secretion, and thus sensitize the tumor cells to RSL&#8208;3&#8208;inducible ferroptosis. The combination of nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis and blockade of programmed death ligand 1&#160;efficiently inhibits growth of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma tumor and lung metastasis of 4T1 breast tumors, suggesting the promising potential of ferroptosis induction for promoting cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Dynamically Crosslinked Dry Ion&#8208;Conducting Elastomers for Soft Iontronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamically crosslinked dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomers with exceptional properties of high ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, stretchability, and transparency are reported. Two self&#8208;healing stretchable iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are then realized with excellent environmental stability.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors show great promise in multifunctional iontronic devices, but currently utilized gel materials suffer from liquid leakage or evaporation issues. Here, a dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer with dynamic crosslinking structures is reported. The dynamic crosslinking structures endow it with combined advantageous properties simultaneously, including high ionic conductivity (2.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), self&#8208;healing capability (96% healing efficiency), stretchability (563%), and transparency (78%). With this ionic conductor as the electrode, two soft iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are realized with entirely self&#8208;healing and stretchable capabilities. Due to the absence of liquid materials, the dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer shows wide operational temperature range, and the iontronic devices achieve excellent stability. These findings provide a promising strategy to achieve highly conductive and multifunctional soft dry ionic conductors, and demonstrate their great potential in soft iontronics or electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Dynamically crosslinked dry ion-conducting elastomers with exceptional properties of high ionic conductivity, self-healing capability, stretchability, and transparency are reported. Two self-healing stretchable iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are then realized with excellent environmental stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft ionic conductors show great promise in multifunctional iontronic devices, but currently utilized gel materials suffer from liquid leakage or evaporation issues. Here, a dry ion-conducting elastomer with dynamic crosslinking structures is reported. The dynamic crosslinking structures endow it with combined advantageous properties simultaneously, including high ionic conductivity (2.04 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C), self-healing capability (96% healing efficiency), stretchability (563%), and transparency (78%). With this ionic conductor as the electrode, two soft iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are realized with entirely self-healing and stretchable capabilities. Due to the absence of liquid materials, the dry ion-conducting elastomer shows wide operational temperature range, and the iontronic devices achieve excellent stability. These findings provide a promising strategy to achieve highly conductive and multifunctional soft dry ionic conductors, and demonstrate their great potential in soft iontronics or electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Expanding Biomaterial Surface Topographical Design Space through Natural Surface Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topographical design space is immense, with many geometries existing. To explore this design space on cell behavior, the TopoChip is utilized with 2176 unique microtopographies. Nevertheless, phenotypical readouts are potentially lost due to an incomplete design space coverage. This coverage is expanded effectively in this work by including natural surfaces such as the red rose, leading to novel phenotypical discoveries.








Abstract
Surface topography is a tool to endow biomaterials with bioactive properties. However, the large number of possible designs makes it challenging to find the optimal surface structure to induce a specific cell response. The TopoChip platform is currently the largest collection of topographies with 2176 in silico designed microtopographies. Still, it is exploring only a small part of the design space due to design algorithm limitations and the surface engineering strategy. Inspired by the diversity of natural surfaces, it is assessed as to what extent the topographical design space and consequently the resulting cellular responses can be expanded using natural surfaces. To this end, 26 plant and insect surfaces are replicated in polystyrene and their surface properties are quantified using white light interferometry. Through machine&#8208;learning algorithms, it is demonstrated that natural surfaces extend the design space of the TopoChip, which coincides with distinct morphological and focal adhesion profiles in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Furthermore, differentiation experiments reveal the strong potential of the holy lotus to improve osteogenesis in MSCs. In the future, the design algorithms will be trained with the results obtained by natural surface imprint experiments to explore the bioactive properties of novel surface topographies.

Immunotherapy&#8208;involved combination cancer therapy: the rapid development in the combination of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities for cancer therapy are systematically reviewed, and the critical challenges and future directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Immunotherapy that can activate immunity or enhance the immunogenicity of tumors has emerged as one of the most effective methods for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, single&#8208;mode immunotherapy is still confronted with several critical challenges, such as the low immune response, the low tumor infiltration, and the complex immunosuppression tumor microenvironment. Recently, the combination of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities has emerged as a powerful strategy to augment the therapeutic outcome in fighting against cancer. In this review, recent research advances of the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, sonodynamic therapy, metabolic therapy, and microwave thermotherapy are summarized. Critical challenges and future research direction of immunotherapy&#8208;based cancer therapeutic strategy are also discussed.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Silicene/Silicon Nanosheets: An Emerging Silicon&#8208;Composed Nanostructure in Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developments in the construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8208;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics and antibacteria, are highlighted. A multi variate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these silicene/silicon nanosheets is conducted and an outlook for further clinical translations is given.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;composed nanomedicines are one of the most representative inorganic nanosystems in theranostic biomedicine. The emerging of new family members of silicon&#8208;composed nanosystems substantially contributes to their further clinical translation. 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have recently been developed as an emerging topology of silicon&#8208;composed nanoparticles, which features unique planar nanostructure with large surface area, abundant surface chemistry, specific physiochemical property, and desirable biological effects. This progress report highlights and discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;art developments of the elaborate construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8211;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering, and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics (e.g., bioimaging, photothermal ablation, chemotherapy, chemoreactive nanotherapy, radiotherapy, and synergistic nanotherapy) and antibacteria. Their large surface area originating from 2D nanostructure not only enables efficient loading and delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, but also guarantees the multifunctionalization. Especially, 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets harness desirable photothermal&#8208;conversion performance for photonic hyperthermia and photoacoustic imaging in the near infrared biowindow, accompanied with the desirable biodegradability and biocompatibility, which is typically not possessed in other silicon&#8208;composed counterparts. The multivariate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have also been conducted and outlooked for further underpinning their clinical translations.

Finally, a brief conclusion is also given with comments on the challenges and prospective future research directions in this field.

Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are possibly the smallest integrated optoelectronic devices that combine the switching and amplification mechanisms of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and the electroluminescent characteristic of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Such a unique architecture of OLETs makes them ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation display technology and electrically pumped lasers for miniaturized photonic devices and circuits. However, the development of OLETs has been slow. Recently, some exciting progress has been made with breakthroughs in high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, construction of high&#8208;performance OLETs, and fabrication of novel multifunctional OLETs. This recent slew of advances may represent the advent of a new development stage of OLETs and their related devices and circuits. In this paper, a detailed review of these fantastic advances is presented, with a special focus on the key points for developing high&#8208;performance OLETs. Finally, a brief conclusion is provided with a discussion on the challenges and future perspectives in this field.

Abstract
Hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of clean hydrogen fuel. The production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is an essential prerequisite of the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emission. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water splitting has been commercialized for more than 100 years, representing the most mature and economic technology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of clean hydrogen fuel. The production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is an essential prerequisite of the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emission. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water splitting has been commercialized for more than 100 years, representing the most mature and economic technology. Here, the historic development of water electrolysis is overviewed, and several critical electrochemical parameters are discussed. After that, advanced nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that emerged recently for negotiating the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are discussed, including transition metal oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides for the OER, as well as transition metal alloys, chalcogenides, phosphides, and carbides for the HER. In this section, particular attention is paid to the catalyst synthesis, activity and stability challenges, performance improvement, and industry-relevant developments. Some recent works about scaled-up catalyst synthesis, novel electrode designs, and alkaline seawater electrolysis are also spotlighted. Finally, an outlook on future challenges and opportunities for alkaline water splitting is offered, and potential future directions are speculated.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mapping the Design of Electrolyte Materials for Electrically Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte materials play a significant role in the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and low&#8208;cost electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. The challenges and progress in electrolyte materials are presented, with the aim of providing insight into the future development of novel electrolyte systems for electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ERZABs) have attracted substantial research interest as one of the best candidate power sources for electric vehicles, grid&#8208;scale energy storage, and portable electronics owing to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental benignity. However, the realization of ERZABs with long cycle life and high energy and power densities is still a considerable challenge. The electrolyte, which serves as the ionic conductor, is one of the core components of ERZABs, as it plays a significant role during the discharge&#8211;charge process and greatly influences the rechargeability, operating voltage, lifespan, power density, and safety of ERZABs. Herein, the fundamental electrochemistry of electrolyte materials for ERZABs and the associated challenges are presented. Furthermore, recent advances in electrolyte materials for ERZABs, including alkaline aqueous electrolytes, nonalkaline electrolytes, ionic liquids, and semisolid&#8208;state electrolytes are discussed. This work aims to provide insights into the future exploration of high&#8208;performance electrolytes and thus promote the development of ERZABs.

         <dc:description>
Water oxidation, also known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for hydrogen generation and the carbon dioxide reduction. The thermodynamics, Pourbaix diagram, theoretical screening and prediction, catalytic performance, as well as reaction kinetics and mechanisms of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Water oxidation, or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which combines two oxygen atoms from two water molecules and releases one oxygen molecule, plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for the hydrogen generation, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen fixation. The multielectron transfer OER process involves multiple reaction intermediates, and a high overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics. Among the different water splitting devices, proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer offers greater advantages. However, current anode OER electrocatalysts in PEM electrolyzers are limited to precious iridium and ruthenium oxides. Developing highly active, stable, and precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic media is attractive for the large&#8208;scale application of PEM electrolyzers. In recent years, various types of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts such as carbon&#8208;based materials, earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides, and multiple metal oxide mixtures have been investigated and some of them show promising activity and stability for acidic OER. In this review, the thermodynamics of water oxidation, Pourbaix diagram of metal elements in aqueous solution, and theoretical screening and prediction of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER are first elaborated. The catalytic performance, reaction kinetics, and mechanisms together with future research directions regarding acidic OER are summarized and discussed.

         <title>Design of Highly Durable Core&#8722;Shell Catalysts by Controlling Shell Distribution Guided by In&#8208;Situ Corrosion Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors demonstrate that in&#8208;situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy observation can guide the design of highly durable electrocatalysts, which is further verified by in&#8208;situ corrosion and practical cyclic voltammetry measurements with the loss of 0.37% and 9.01% in specific and mass activities towards oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Most degradations in electrocatalysis are caused by corrosion in operation, for example the corrosion of the core in a core&#8722;shell electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, according to the in&#8208;situ study on nanoscale corrosion kinetics via liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) in the authors&#8217; previous work, they sequentially designed an optimized nanocube with the protection of more layers on the corners by adjusting the Pt atom distribution on corners and terraces. This modified nanocube (MNC) is much more corrosion resistant in the in&#8208;situ observation. Furthermore, in the practical electrochemical stability testing, the MNC catalyst also showed the best stability performance with the 0.37% and 9.01% loss in specific and mass activity after 30&#8201;000 cycles accelerated durability test (ADT). This work also demonstrates that how an in&#8208;situ study can guide the design of desired materials with improved properties and build a bridge between in&#8208;situ study and practical application.

         <title>Uranium In Situ Electrolytic Deposition with a Reusable Functional Graphene&#8208;Foam Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reusable 3D functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D&#8208;FrGOF) is used as an in situ electrolytic deposition electrode to extract uranium from contaminated water. The specific U(VI) extraction capacity is 4560&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and the Coulombic efficiency is 54%. Moreover, uranium in spiked seawater is reduced from 3&#160;ppm to less than 19.9 ppb (the US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water limit is 30 ppb).








Abstract
Nuclear fission produces 400 GWe which represents 11% of the global electricity output. Uranium is the essential element as both fission fuel and radioactive waste. Therefore, the recovery of uranium is of great importance. Here, an in situ electrolytic deposition method to extract uranium from aqueous solution is reported. A functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D&#8208;FrGOF) is used as the working electrode, which acts as both a hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst and a uranium deposition substrate. The specific electrolytic deposition capacity for U(VI) ions with the 3D&#8208;FrGOF is 4560&#160;mg g&#8722;1 without reaching saturation, and the Coulombic efficiency can reach 54%. Moreover, reduction of the uranium concentration in spiked seawater from 3&#160;ppm to 19.9 ppb is achieved, which is lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency uranium limits for drinking water (30 ppb). Furthermore, the collection electrode can be efficiently regenerated and recycled at least nine times without much efficiency fading, by ejecting into 2000&#160;ppm concentrated uranium solution in a second bath with reverse voltage bias.

&lt;p&gt;A reusable 3D functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D-FrGOF) is used as an in situ electrolytic deposition electrode to extract uranium from contaminated water. The specific U(VI) extraction capacity is 4560&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the Coulombic efficiency is 54%. Moreover, uranium in spiked seawater is reduced from 3&#160;ppm to less than 19.9 ppb (the US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water limit is 30 ppb).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear fission produces 400 GWe which represents 11% of the global electricity output. Uranium is the essential element as both fission fuel and radioactive waste. Therefore, the recovery of uranium is of great importance. Here, an in situ electrolytic deposition method to extract uranium from aqueous solution is reported. A functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D-FrGOF) is used as the working electrode, which acts as both a hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst and a uranium deposition substrate. The specific electrolytic deposition capacity for U(VI) ions with the 3D-FrGOF is 4560&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without reaching saturation, and the Coulombic efficiency can reach 54%. Moreover, reduction of the uranium concentration in spiked seawater from 3&#160;ppm to 19.9 ppb is achieved, which is lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency uranium limits for drinking water (30 ppb). Furthermore, the collection electrode can be efficiently regenerated and recycled at least nine times without much efficiency fading, by ejecting into 2000&#160;ppm concentrated uranium solution in a second bath with reverse voltage bias. All these findings open new opportunities in using free-standing 3D-FrGOF electrode as an advanced separation technique for water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Construction of a Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with a High Density of Open Cr Sites for Record N2/O2 Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework material TYUT&#8208;96Cr, with dual open Cr (III) sites, record&#8208;high N2 capture capacity, and N2/O2 selectivity is developed, showing the highest separation performance, far beyond the current adsorbent. Importantly, this material displays ultrahigh structural stability under water, acid/base, and humidity conditions, being practically useful for O2 separation and purification in industry.








Abstract
The removal of low concentration N2 is of great significance and challenging in the industrial production of high&#8208;purity O2. Herein, a chromium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, namely, TYUT&#8208;96Cr, is reported, which has an unprecedented N2 capture capacity of 37.46 cm3 cm&#8722;3 and N2/O2 (5:95, v/v) selectivity up to 26.95 (298 K and 1 bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported metal&#8211;organic frameworks and commercially used ones (Li&#8208;LSX and 13X). Breakthrough experiments reveal that N2 can be directly extracted from various N2/O2 (79:21, 50:50, 5:95, and 1:99, v/v) mixtures by this material, affording a record&#8208;high O2&#8208;production scale with 99.99% purity. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the high&#8208;density open Cr (III) sites in TYUT&#8208;96Cr can behave as effective Lewis acidic sites, thus resulting in a strong affinity toward N2. The high N2 adsorption selectivity, exceptional separation performance, and ultrahigh structural stability render this porous material with great potential for this important industrial application.

         <title>Superfast Water Transport Zwitterionic Polymeric Nanofluidic Membrane Reinforced by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid&#8208;scaffold&#8208;reinforced polymeric nanoparticles&#8217; interfacial channel strategy is proposed for fabricating nanofluidic membranes that exhibit water permeance and dye/salt selectivity that are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional polymeric membranes. The unprecedented separation performance is due to the paradigm shift of water transport from conventional viscos flow to ultrafast nanofluidic flow in the membrane nanofluidics.








Abstract
Nanofluidics derived from low&#8208;dimensional nanosheets and protein nanochannels are crucial for advanced catalysis, sensing, and separation. However, polymer nanofluidics is halted by complicated preparation and miniaturized sizes. This work reports the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of modular nanofluidics by confined growth of ultrathin metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in a polymer membrane consisting of zwitterionic dopamine nanoparticles (ZNPs). The confined growth of the MOFs on the ZNPs reduces the chain entanglement between the ZNPs, leading to stiff interfacial channels enhancing the nanofluidic transport of water molecules through the membrane. As such, the water permeability and solute selectivity of MOF@ZNPM are one magnitude improved, leading to a record&#8208;high performance among all polymer nanofiltration membranes. Both the experimental work and the molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the water transport is shifted from high&#8208;friction&#8208;resistance conventional viscous flow to ultrafast nanofluidic flow as a result of rigid and continuous nanochannels in MOF@ZNPM.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enabling a High&#8208;Safety and High&#8208;Performance Si Anode with a Tailored Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonflammable and ether&#8208;based electrolyte is formulated here in enabling a highly stabilized Si anode and the LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC532) cathode. High reversible capacity of the Si electrode is retained at 2041.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, with capacity fading rate of 0.0615% per cycle. A full cell coupling unmodified Si with commercial NMC532 cathode demonstrates cycle life to 60 cycles.








Abstract
Silicon (Si) anodes are advantageous for application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries in terms of their high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g&#8722;1), appropriate operating voltage (&lt;0.4&#160;V vs Li/Li+), and earth&#8208;abundancy. Nevertheless, a large volume change of Si particles emerges with cycling, triggering unceasing breakage/re&#8208;formation of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and thereby the fast capacity degradation in traditional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes. Herein, it is demonstrated that superior cyclability of Si anode is achievable using a nonflammable ether&#8208;based electrolyte with fluoroethylene carbonate and lithium oxalyldifluoroborate dual additives. By forming a high&#8208;modulus SEI rich in fluoride (F) and boron (B) species, a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 90.2% is attained in Si/Li cells, accompanied with a low capacity&#8208;fading rate of only 0.0615% per cycle (discharge capacity of 2041.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). Full cells pairing the unmodified Si anode with commercial LiFePO4 (&#8776;13.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (&#8776;17.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathodes further show extended service life to 150 and 60 cycles, respectively, demonstrating the superior cathode&#8208;compatibility realized with a thin and F, B&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interface. This work offers an easily scalable approach in developing high&#8208;performance Si&#8208;based batteries through Si/electrolyte interphase regulation.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active MXene&#8208;Based Bifunctional ORR/OER Double&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) show the most promising bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances. The bifunctional catalytic activities of DACs improve with increasing strain. Theoretical models are presented for plotting the polarization curves of OER/ORR catalysis to demonstrate the bifunctional catalytic performance of the studied catalysts.








Abstract
Designing highly active and bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has attracted great interest toward metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, an efficient solution to the search for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts is proposed by introducing non&#8208;noble metals such as Fe/Co/Ni at the surfaces. These results indicate that the ultrahigh activities in Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) for bifunctional ORR/OER are better than those of well&#8208;known unifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials, such as Pt(111) for the ORR and IrO2(110) for the OER. Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene&#8208;based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene&#8208;based DACs are attributed to the electron&#8208;capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional DACs.

Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene-based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene-based DACs are attributed to the electron-capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene-based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble-metal-free bifunctional DACs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient Blue Light Emitting Diodes Based On Europium Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ideal blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting materials should simultaneously achieve narrow emission linewidth, suitable Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage color coordinate, excellent stability, good manufacturing compatibility, as well as, non&#8208;toxic composition, which are rarely observed in previously reported materials. The design of robust and efficient lanthanide based halide perovskites CsEuBr3 offers one possible solution for this long&#8208;standing challenge.








Abstract
Flat panel displays enjoy 100 billion&#8208;dollar markets with significant penetration in daily life, which require efficient, color&#8208;saturated blue, green, and red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). The recently emerged halide perovskites have demonstrated low&#8208;cost and outstanding performance for potential LED applications. However, the performance of blue perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) lags far behind red and green cousins, particularly for color coordinates approaching (0.131, 0.046) that fulfill the Rec. 2020 specification for blue emitters. Here, a high&#8208;efficiency, lead&#8208;free perovskite, CsEuBr3, is reported that exhibits bright blue exciton emission centered at 448&#160;nm with a color coordinates of (0.15, 0.04), contributed from Eu&#8208;5d&#8594;Eu&#8208;4f/Br&#8208;4p transition with an optical band gap of 2.85&#160;eV. Further optical characterizations reveal its short excited&#8208;state lifetime of 151&#160;ns, excellent exciton diffusion diffusivity of 0.0227 cm2 s&#8722;1, and high quantum yield of &#8776;69%. Inspired by these findings, deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs based on all&#8208;vacuum processing methods, which have been demonstrated as the most successful approach for the organic LED industry, are constructed. The devices show a maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.5% with an operating half&#8208;lifetime of 50 mins at an initial brightness of 15.9&#160;cd m&#8722;2. It is anticipated that this work will inspire further research on lanthanide&#8208;based perovskites for next&#8208;generation LED applications.

         <title>Strong Suppression of Thermal Conductivity in the Presence of Long Terminal Alkyl Chains in Low&#8208;Disorder Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation identifies a significant drop in in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity upon end alkylation of the aromatic rings of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT), which is understood from a detailed vibrational&#8208;mode analysis. Combined with their enhanced charge transport, the results suggest the possibility of decoupling electron and phonon transport in alkylated DNTT systems, which opens pathways for improved thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
While the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors have been extensively studied over the recent years, the field of organics&#8208;based thermoelectrics is still limited by a lack of experimental data on thermal transport and of understanding of the associated structure&#8211;property relationships. To fill this gap, a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the lattice thermal conductivity in polycrystalline thin films of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (Cn&#8208;DNTT&#8208;Cn with n&#160;= 0, 8) semiconductors is reported. Strikingly, thermal conductivity appears to be much more isotropic than charge transport, which is confined to the 2D molecular layers. A direct comparison between experimental measurements (3&#969;&#8211;V&#246;lklein method) and theoretical estimations (approach&#8208;to&#8208;equilibrium molecular dynamics (AEMD) method) indicates that the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity is strongly reduced in the presence of the long terminal alkyl chains. This evolution can be rationalized by the strong localization of the intermolecular vibrational modes in C8&#8208;DNTT&#8208;C8 in comparison to unsubstituted DNTT cores, as evidenced by a vibrational mode analysis. Combined with the enhanced charge transport properties of alkylated DNTT systems, this opens the possibility to decouple electron and phonon transport in these materials, which provides great potential for enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT.
