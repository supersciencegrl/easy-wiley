         <title>Activatable cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy using semiconducting polymer nanobodies</title>

Abstract
Despite the great promises of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in combination cancer therapy, its clinical applications are hindered by the lack of efficient sonosensitizers and &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; pharmacological activities of therapeutic agents. Herein, we report the development of semiconducting polymers as efficient sonosensitizers and further development of sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanobodies (SPNAb) for activatable cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy. Conjugation of anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies onto the polymer nanoparticles through 1O2&#8208;cleavable linker affords SPNAb with relatively low CTLA&#8208;4 binding affinity. Upon sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNAb generates 1O2 not only to elicit sonodynamic effect to induce the immunogenic cell death, but also to release anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies and trigger in situ checkpoint blockade. Such a synergistic therapeutic action mediated by SPNAb modulates the tumoricidal function of T&#8208;cell immunity by promoting the proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and depleting immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, resulting in effective tumor regression, metastasis inhibition, durable immunological memory, and prevention of relapse. Therefore, this study represents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sonodynamic strategy using semiconducting polymers for precise spatiotemporal control over immunotherapy.

         <title>Spatial Distribution Control of Antimicrobial Peptides through a Novel Polymeric Carrier for Safe and Efficient Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric antimicrobial peptides (AMP) carrier that can enhance anticancer efficacy and minimize the potential side effects of AMPs by finely controlling their spatial distribution is reported. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability.








Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold great potential for use in tumor treatment. However, developing AMP&#8208;based antitumor therapies is challenging due to circulatory instability, hemolytic toxicity, low selectivity, and poor cell permeability of AMPs. In this study, a polymeric carrier for AMPs (denoted as PAMPm&#8208;co&#8208;PPBEn/PCA) is presented that effectively enhances their anticancer efficacy while minimizing their potential side effects. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability. Upon employing KLA as the model AMP, the polymeric carrier's hemolytic toxicity during blood circulation is suppressed, its cellular internalization when reaching tumor tissues facilitated, and its membranolytic toxicity toward the mitochondria upon entering cancer cells restored and further enhanced. Animal studies indicate that this approach significantly improves the antitumor efficacy of KLA and reduces its toxicity. Considering that the loading method for most AMPs is identical to that of KLA, the polymeric carrier reported in this study may provide a feasible approach for the development of AMP&#8208;based cancer treatments.

         <title>Platelet Pharmacytes for the Hierarchical Amplification of Antitumor Immunity in Response to Self&#8208;Generated Immune Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;adaptive platelet pharmacytes, consisting of encapsulated Rab27a siRNA nanocomplexes and backpacked anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanogels, are engineered to hierarchically amplify antitumor immunity. The platelet pharmacytes efficiently silence Rab27a in tumor cells to inhibit secretion of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes, which relieves the immunosuppression and cascadingly releases anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to sensitize anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade.








Abstract
Systemic immunosuppression mediated by tumor&#8208;derived exosomes is an important cause for the resistance of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Herein, self&#8208;adaptive platelet (PLT) pharmacytes are engineered to mediate cascaded delivery of exosome&#8208;inhibiting siRNA and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPDL1) toward synergized antitumor immunity. In the pharmacytes, polycationic nanocomplexes (NCs) assembled from Rab27 siRNA (siRab) and a membrane&#8208;penetrating polypeptide are encapsulated inside the open canalicular system of PLTs, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;responsive aPDL1 nanogels (NGs) are covalently backpacked on the PLT surface. Upon systemic administration, the pharmacytes enable prolonged blood circulation and active accumulation to tumors, wherein PLTs are activated to liberate siRab NCs, which efficiently transfect tumor cells, silence Rab27a, and inhibit exosome secretion. The immunosuppression is thus relieved, leading to the activation, proliferation, and tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, which trigger latent aPDL1 release. As such, the competitive aPDL1 exhaustion by PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing exosomes is minimized to sensitize ICB. Synergistically, siRab and aPDL1 induce strong antitumor immunological response and memory against syngeneic murine melanoma. This study reports a bioinspired mechanism to resolve the blood circulation/cell internalization contradiction of polycationic siRNA delivery systems, and renders an enlightened approach for the spatiotemporal enhancement of antitumor immunity.

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Computing using Memristor Arrays with Ultrathin 2D PdSeOx/PdSe2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure is demonstrated using controllable ultraviolet&#8211;ozone treatment. By confining the formation of conductive filaments in the heterostructure, the memristor achieves a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. The crossbar array further enables multiple convolutional image processing with a high image&#8208;recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4%.








Abstract
In&#8208;memory computing based on memristor arrays holds promise to address the speed and energy issues of the classical von Neumann computing system. However, the stochasticity of ions&#8217; transport in conventional oxide&#8208;based memristors imposes severe intrinsic variability, which compromises learning accuracy and hinders the implementation of neural network hardware accelerators. Here, these challenges are addressed using a low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on an ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure switching medium realized by a controllable ultraviolet (UV)&#8211;ozone treatment. A distinctively different ions&#8217; transport mechanism is revealed in the heterostructure that can confine the formation of conductive filaments, leading to a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability values of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. Moreover, convolutional image processing is further implemented using various crossbar kernels that achieve a high recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4% due to the highly linear and symmetric analog weight update as well as multiple conductance states, manifesting its potential beyond von Neumann computing.

         <title>Adaptive Self&#8208;Organization of Nanomaterials Enables Strain&#8208;Insensitive Resistance of Stretchable Metallic Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable metallic nanocomposite with strain&#8208;insensitive resistance is proposed. When the surface of silver nanomaterials is treated with 1&#8208;decanethiol, the nanomaterials self&#8208;organize in response to external strain. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials enables preservation of the percolation networks, resulting in strain&#8208;insensitive resistance of the nanocompsite.








Abstract
Highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites are promising material candidates for skin electronics.

     alt="Adaptive Self-Organization of Nanomaterials Enables Strain-Insensitive Resistance of Stretchable Metallic Nanocomposites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable metallic nanocomposite with strain-insensitive resistance is proposed. When the surface of silver nanomaterials is treated with 1-decanethiol, the nanomaterials self-organize in response to external strain. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials enables preservation of the percolation networks, resulting in strain-insensitive resistance of the nanocompsite.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites are promising material candidates for skin electronics. However, the resistance of stretchable metallic nanocomposites highly depends on external strains, often deteriorating the performance of fabricated electronic devices. Here, a material strategy for the highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites comprising metal nanomaterials of various dimensions and a viscoelastic block-copolymer matrix is presented. The resistance of the nanocomposites can be well retained under skin deformations (&amp;lt;50% strain). It is demonstrated that silver nanomaterials can self-organize inside the viscoelastic media in response to external strain when their surface is conjugated with 1-decanethiol. Distinct self-organization behaviors associated with nanomaterial dimensions and strain conditions are found.

         <title>Printable and Highly Stretchable Viscoelastic Conductors with Kinematically Reconstructed Conductive Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Printable and stretchable conductors based on metallic filler&#8208;reinforced polymer composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity at large strains are essential for emerging applications in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and bio&#8208;integrated devices. Regulating microstructures of conductive fillers during mechanical deformations is the key to reconstructing the conductive pathway and retaining high electrical conductivity, which has proven to be challenging. Here, we report that Ag flakes can spontaneously reorganize inside a viscoelastic, liquid&#8208;like polymer matrix by cyclic mechanical stretching, resulting in reconstructed microstructures and forming highly efficient and stable conductive pathways. Consequently, the electrical conductivities of the resultant composites can be dramatically enhanced by 4&#8764;8 orders of magnitude and reach &#8764;104 S/cm. The stretch&#8208;induced kinematic movements of Ag flakes inside the polymer matrix, together with the reorganization and stabilization mechanisms, are unraveled and validated by the dissipative particle dynamics simulations. This unique phenomenon enables high&#8208;performance stretchable conductors to be fabricated with significantly reduced conductive fillers. The printable and stretchable composites presented here hold great promise for uses in soft and stretchable electronics, as demonstrated in stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode arrays and wearable electronics.

         <title>Ge&#8208;bidirectional Diffusion to Simultaneously Engineer Back Interface and Bulk Defects in the Absorber for Efficient CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aiming at large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit in Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, a new and effective strategy to simultaneously regulate the back interface and restrain bulk defects of CZTSSe absorbers has been developed for the first time by directly introducing a thin GeO2 layer on Mo substrates. As high as 13.14% PCE (power&#8208;to&#8208;efficiency) with the VOC of 547&#160;mV has been achieved for the champion device, which presents a certified efficiency of 12.8% (aperture area: 0.25667cm2). Further investigation reveals that Ge&#8208;bidirectional diffusion simultaneously occurs toward the CZTSSe absorber and MoSe2 layer at the back interface while being selenized. That is, some Ge element from the GeO2 diffuses into the CZTSSe absorber layer to afford Ge&#8208;doped absorbers, which can significantly reduce the defect density and band tailing, and facilitate quasi&#8208;Fermi level split by relatively higher hole concentration. Meanwhile, a small amount of Ge element also participates in the formation of MoSe2 at the back interface, thus enhancing the work function of MoSe2 and effectively separating photoinduced carriers. This work highlights synergistic effect of Ge element toward the bulk absorber and the back interface and also provides an easy&#8208;handling way to achieve high&#8208;performance CZTSSe solar cells.

         <title>Confined Assembly of Colloidal Nanorod Superstructures by Locally Controlling Free&#8208;volume Entropy in Non&#8208;equilibrium Fluids</title>

Abstract
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered structures of nanoparticles with controllable orientation have advantages in the applications toward sensors, photoelectric conversion, and field&#8208;effect transistors. The assembly process of nanorods in colloidal systems undergoes a non&#8208;equilibrium process from dispersion to aggregation. A variety of assembly methods such as solvent volatilization, electromagnetic field induction, and photoinduction are restricted to suppress local perturbations during the non&#8208;equilibrium concentration of nanoparticles, which are adverse to controlling the orientation and order of assembled structures. Here, we report a confined assembly method by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy in non&#8208;equilibrium fluids to fabricate microstructure arrays based on colloidal nanorods with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order. The unique fluid dynamics of the liquid bridge is utilized to form a local region, where the free volume entropy reduction triggers assembly near the three&#8208;phase contact line (TPCL), allowing nanorods to assemble in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) closest packing parallel to the TPCL for maximum Gibbs free energy reduction. By manipulating the orientation of liquid flow, we assemble microstructures with programmable geometry, which sustains polarized photoluminescence (PL) and polarization&#8208;dependent photodetection. This confined assembly method opens up perspectives on assemblies of nanomaterials with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order as a platform for multifunctional integrated devices.

         <title>Microstructured hydrogels to guide self&#8208;assembly and function of lung alveolospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Epithelial cell organoids have increased opportunities to probe questions on tissue development and disease in vitro and for therapeutic cell transplantation. Despite their potential, current protocols to grow these organoids almost exclusively depend on culture within three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions, introduces animal components, and results in heterogenous organoids (i.e., shape, size, composition). Here, we describe a method that relies on polymeric hydrogel substrates for the generation and expansion of lung alveolar organoids (alveolospheres). Using synthetic hydrogels with defined chemical and physical properties, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)&#8208;derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) self&#8208;assemble into alveolospheres and propagate in Matrigel&#8208;free conditions. By engineering pre&#8208;defined microcavities within these hydrogels, the heterogeneity of alveolosphere size and structure is reduced when compared to 3D culture, while maintaining alveolar type 2 cell fate of human iAT2&#8208;derived progenitor cells. This hydrogel system is a facile and accessible culture system for the culture of iPSC&#8208;derived lung progenitors and the method can be expanded to the culture of primary mouse tissue&#8208;derived AT2 and other epithelial progenitor and stem cell aggregates.

         <title>Recyclable, Healable, and Tough Ionogels Insensitive to Crack Propagation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Most gels and elastomers introduce sacrificial bonds in the covalent network to dissipate energy. However, long&#8208;term cyclic loading caused irreversible fatigue damage and crack propagation cannot be prevented. Furthermore, because of the irreversible covalent crosslinked networks, it is a huge challenge to implement reversible mechanical interlocking and reorganize the polymer segments to realize the recycling and reuse of ionogels. Here, we replace covalent crosslinking of host materials with entanglement. The entangled microdomains were used as physical crosslinking while introducing reversible bond interactions. The interpenetrating, entangled, and elastic microdomains of linear segments and covalent&#8208;network microspheres provide mechanical stability, eliminate stress concentration at the crack tip under load, and achieve unprecedented tear and fatigue resistance of ionogels in any load direction. Moreover, reversible entanglements and non&#8208;covalent interactions can be disentangled and recombined to achieve recycling and mechanical regeneration, and the recyclability of covalent&#8208;network microdomains are realized.

         <title>Stacked Plasmonic Metamaterial with Strong Localized Electric Field Enables Highly Efficient Broadband Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light utilization largely governs the performance of CO2 photoconversion, whereas most of the materials that have been implemented in such an application are restricted in narrow spectral absorption range. Plasmonic metamaterials with designable regular pattern and facile tunability are excellent candidates for maximizing light absorption to generate substantial hot electrons and thermal energy. Herein, we report a concept by coupling Au&#8208;based stacked plasmonic metamaterial with single Cu atoms in alloy, as light absorber and catalytic sites respectively, for gas&#8208;phase light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The metamaterial structure works in broad spectral range (370&#8208;1040&#160;nm) to generate high surface temperature for photothermal catalysis, as well as induces strong localized electric field in favor of hot electrons transfer and reduced energy barrier in CO2 hydrogenation. This work unravels the significant role of strong localized electric field in photothermal catalysis, and demonstrates a scalable fabrication approach to light&#8208;driven catalysts based on plasmonic metamaterials.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Melting and Solvation Reconfiguration of Phase Change Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase change materials (PCMs) are a unique and exciting class of materials with bright prospects in wide&#8208;ranging sustainable technologies such as thermal and electrochemical energy storage. While impressive, the effect of gaseous species on PCMs remains largely unexplored hitherto. Here, the gaseous co&#8208;solvent is reported that can facilitate melting and modulate physical properties such as viscosity and ion conduction of PCMs. Especially for the appealing application of PCMs as electrolytes, gaseous species also have a critical influence on both Li+&#8208;electrolyte structure and resultant solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Specifically, theoretical simulations and experimental analysis evidence that CO2 can promote melting while reconfiguring the solvation structure of succinonitrile&#8208;derived Li+&#8208;phase change electrolyte (Li+&#8208;PCE) model system. Due to the enhanced interaction between Li+ cations and bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (TFSI&#8211;) anions in the reconfigured solvation structure, more TFSI&#8211; derived F&#8208;rich component and extra CO2&#8208;derived Li2CO3 form in the upgraded SEI layer, thereby endowing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Li&#8208;metal batteries with prolonged cyclability. Our findings may stimulate widespread interest in gas leverage to innovate electrolyte chemistry.

         <title>Metalloid&#8208;cluster ligands enabling stable and active FeN4&#8208;Ten motifs for oxygen reduction reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In nature, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes containing heme iron centers with an axial thiolate ligand (FeN4&#8208;S), which are among the most finely developed catalysts by natural selection. However, the exceptional ORR activity and selectivity of CYP enzymes originate from their non&#8208;rigid and self&#8208;adaptive coordination network with molecular ligands, which sacrifices the stability of the active motifs under electrochemical reaction conditions. Here, we demonstrate a design strategy to circumvent this dilemma by incorporating Fe&#8208;N4 motifs into carbon matrices instead of the protein scaffold, and replacing the axial molecular thiolate ligand with a stable tellurium cluster (Ten). Theoretical calculations indicate a moderate interaction between Fe 3d and Te 5p orbitals once n&gt;2, allowing the Fe&#8208;Te bond to dynamically change its strength to adaptively facilitate the intermediate steps during the ORR process, which renders FeN4&#8208;Ten active sites superior ORR activity. This adaptive behavior mimics the conformational dynamics of an enzyme during the reaction, but retains the stability nature as a heterogeneous catalyst. Our experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed catalyst with a characterized FeN4&#8208;Ten structure outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst both on activity and stability. These findings may pave a new way towards heterogeneous catalyst design mimicking the self&#8208;adaptive catalytic behavior of enzymes without a compromise between activity and stability.

         <title>Integrating Bi@C Nanospheres in Porous Hard Carbon Frameworks for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8211;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as an alternative technology because of their merits in abundance and cost. Realizing their real applications, however, remains a formidable challenge. One is that among the limitations of anode materials, the alloy&#8208;type candidates tolerate fast capacity fading during cycling. Here we first synthesize a three&#8208;dimensional framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with metallic Bi nanospheres coated carbon layer by themolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework nanorods as anode material for SIBs. Due to the unique structural superiority, the anode design manifests excellent sodium&#8208;storage performance in terms of high capacity, excellent cycling stability, and ultrahigh rate capability up to 80 A/g with a capacity of 308.8 mAh/g. Pairing the current anode with a perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode yields a full cell that delivers the energy density up to 129&#160;Wh/kg. The unprecedented sodium storage ability is not only attributed to the unique hybrid architecture, but also to the production of homogeneous and thin solid electrolyte interface layer and the formation of uniform porous nanostructures during cycling in ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Importantly, we illuminate the deeper understanding of the underlying cause of performance improvement, which is vital to provide the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.

         <title>Unraveling Thermodynamic and Kinetic Contributions to the Stability of Doped Nanocrystalline Alloys using Nanometallic Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Targeted doping of grain boundaries has been widely pursued as a pathway for combating thermal instabilities in nanocrystalline metals. However, certain dopants predicted to produce grain boundary segregated nanocrystalline configurations instead form small nanoprecipitates at elevated temperatures that act to kinetically inhibit grain growth. In this study, thermodynamic modeling is implemented to select the Mo&#8208;Au system for exploring the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to nanostructure stability. Using nanoscale multilayers and in situ transmission electron microscopy thermal aging, evolving segregation states and corresponding phase transitions are mapped with temperature. The microstructure is shown to evolve through a transformation at lower homologous temperatures (&lt; 600&#176;C) where solute atoms cluster and segregate to the grain boundaries, consistent with predictions from thermodynamic models. An increase in temperature to 800&#176;C is accompanied by coarsening of the grain structure via grain boundary migration but with multiple pinning events uncovered between migrating segments of the grain boundary and local solute clustering. Direct comparison between the thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations of microstructure evolution thus demonstrates a transition from thermodynamically preferred to kinetically inhibited nanocrystalline stability and provides a general framework for decoupling contributions to complex stability transitions while simultaneously targeting a dominant thermal stability regime.

An increase in temperature to 800&#176;C is accompanied by coarsening of the grain structure via grain boundary migration but with multiple pinning events uncovered between migrating segments of the grain boundary and local solute clustering. Direct comparison between the thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations of microstructure evolution thus demonstrates a transition from thermodynamically preferred to kinetically inhibited nanocrystalline stability and provides a general framework for decoupling contributions to complex stability transitions while simultaneously targeting a dominant thermal stability regime.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Lysosome&#8208;activated Tetrahedral Nanobox for Encapsulated siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have attracted extensive attention as drug nanocarriers because of their excellent cellular uptake. However, for oligonucleotide cargos, tFNA mainly acts as a static delivery platform generated via sticky&#8208;ended ligation. Here, inspired by the original stable space inside the tetrahedral scaffold, we fabricate a dynamic lysosome&#8208;activated tFNA nanobox for completely encapsulating a short interfering RNA (siRNA) of interest. The closed tetrahedral structure endows cargo siRNA with greater resistance against RNase and serum and enables solid integration with the vehicle during delivery. Moreover, the pH&#8208;responsive switch of nanobox allows the controlled release of siRNA upon entry into lysosomes at cell culture temperature. Based on protective loading and active unloading, an excellent silencing effect on the target TNF&#945; gene was achieved in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conclusively, nanobox offers a dynamic pH&#8208;sensitive confinement delivery system for siRNA and can be an extendable strategy for other small RNA.

Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation of emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a key premise for obtaining single&#8208;crystalline films and designing specific grain&#8208;boundary (GB) structures. Herein, we demonstrated the controllable crystal orientation of graphene during the CVD process on a single&#8208;crystal metal surface with preexisting atomic&#8208;scale stair steps resulting from dislocation slip lines. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle was established to explain and predict the crystal orientation distribution of graphene on a variety of metal facets, especially for the multidirectional growth cases on Cu(hk0) and Cu(hkl) substrates. We successfully synthesized not only large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal graphene, but also bi&#8208;crystal graphene with controllable GB misorientations by rationally employing tailored metal substrate facets. As a demonstration, bi&#8208;crystal graphenes with misorientations of &#8764;21&#176; and &#8764;11&#176; were constructed on Cu(410) and Cu(430) foils, respectively. This guideline builds a bridge linking the crystal orientation of graphene and the substrate facet, thereby opening a new avenue for constructing bi&#8208;crystals with the desired GB structures or manipulating 2D superlattice twist angles in a bottom&#8208;up manner.

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrTe3 for Fabrication of In&#8208;Plane CrTe3/CrTe2 Monolayer Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin CrTe3 films are successfully synthesized. Monolayer (ML) CrTe3 represents a unique van der Waals (vdW) magnet with intralayer antiferromagnetism, which is identified by scanning probe microscopy. A facile method is developed to fabricate CrTe3/CrTe2 magnetic heterostructures from ML CrTe3 with an atomically sharp and seamless interface, which is significant for the development of miniaturized spintronic devices based on vdW magnets.








Abstract
Ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) magnets are heavily pursued for potential applications in developing high&#8208;density miniaturized electronic/spintronic devices as well as for topological physics in low&#8208;dimensional structures. Despite the rapid advances in ultrathin ferromagnetic vdW magnets, the antiferromagnetic counterparts, as well as the antiferromagnetic junctions, are much less studied owing to the difficulties in both material fabrication and magnetism characterization. Ultrathin CrTe3 layers have been theoretically proposed to be a vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor with intrinsic intralayer antiferromagnetism. Herein, the epitaxial growth of monolayer (ML) and bilayer CrTe3 on graphite surface is demonstrated. The structure, electronic and magnetic properties of the ML CrTe3 are characterized by combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The CrTe3 MLs can be further utilized for the fabrication of a lateral heterojunction consisting of ML CrTe2 and ML CrTe3 with an atomically sharp and seamless interface. Since ML CrTe2 is a metallic vdW magnet, such a heterostructure presents the first in&#8208;plane magnetic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterojunction made of two vdW materials. The successful fabrication of ultrathin antiferromagnetic CrTe3, as well as the magnetic heterojunction, will stimulate the development of miniaturized antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on vdW materials.

         <title>Obstructed Surface States as the Descriptor for Predicting Catalytic Active Sites in Inorganic Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic obstructed surfaces states can be a descriptor for the fast and precise identification of catalytic active sites. High&#8208;performance catalysts can be predicted by simply counting the density of obstructed Wannier charge centers under the framework of classic d band theory.








Abstract
The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient and sustainable is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins, which remains a challenge. Here, a novel method to identify the position of active sites based on searching for crystalline symmetry&#8208;protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states is described. The obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic obstructed surface states (OSSs). It is proposed and confirmed that the OSSs are the catalytic activity origins for crystalline materials. The theory on 2H&#8208;MoTe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2, and NiPS3 bulk single crystals is verified, whose active sites are consistent with the calculations. Most importantly, several high&#8208;efficiency catalysts are successfully identified just by considering the number of OWCCs and the symmetry. Using the real&#8208;space&#8208;invariant theory applied to a database of 34 013 topologically trivial insulators, 1788 unique OAIs are identified, of which 465 are potential high&#8208;performance catalysts. The new methodology will facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Hole Germanium Quantum Well on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The quiet quantum environment of holes in solid&#8208;state devices has been at the core of increasingly reliable architectures for quantum processors and memories. However, due to the lack of scalable materials to properly tailor the valence band character and its energy offsets, the precise engineering of light&#8208;hole (LH) states remains a serious obstacle toward coherent photon&#8208;spin interfaces needed for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processor. Herein, to alleviate this long&#8208;standing limitation we&#160;demonstrate an all&#8208;group IV low&#8208;dimensional system consisting of highly tensile strained germanium quantum well grown on silicon allowing new degrees of freedom to control and manipulate the hole states. Wafer&#8208;level, high bi&#8208;isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strain (&gt;1%$&amp;gt;1\%$) is achieved using strain&#8208;engineered, metastable germanium&#8208;tin alloyed buffer layers yielding quantum wells with LH ground state, high g&#8208;factor anisotropy, and a tunable splitting of the hole subbands. The epitaxial heterostructures display sharp interfaces with sub&#8208;nanometer broadening and show room&#8208;temperature excitonic transitions that are modulated and extended to the mid&#8208;wave infrared by controlling strain and thickness. This ability to engineer quantum structures with LH selective confinement and controllable optical response enables manufacturable silicon&#8208;compatible platforms relevant to integrated quantum communication and sensing technologies.&#160;

&lt;p&gt;The quiet quantum environment of holes in solid-state devices has been at the core of increasingly reliable architectures for quantum processors and memories.

This ability to engineer quantum structures with LH selective confinement and controllable optical response enables manufacturable silicon-compatible platforms relevant to integrated quantum communication and sensing technologies.&lt;a href="#adma202201192-supl-0001"&gt;&#160;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultrasensitive Airflow Sensors Based on Suspended Carbon Nanotube Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suspended carbon nanotube networks (SCNTNs) are prepared for fabricating high&#8208;performance airflow sensors. Due to the ultralight and flexible nature of CNTs and their unique junction structures, SCNTN&#8208;based airflow sensors achieved ultrafast response, low detection threshold, high sensitivity, and ultralong cycling lifetime. Acoustic tests and mathematical models show that their high sensing performance originates from the intertube stress at the junctions.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance airflow sensors are in great demand in numerous fields but still face many challenges, such as slow response speed, low sensitivity, large detection threshold, and narrow sensing range. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit many advantages in fabricating airflow sensors due to their nanoscale diameters, excellent mechanical and electrical properties, and so on. However, the intrinsic extraordinary properties of CNTs are not fully exhibited in previously reported CNT&#8208;based airflow sensors due to the mixed structures of macroscale CNT assemblies. Herein, this article presents suspended CNT networks (SCNTNs) as high&#8208;performance airflow sensors, which are self&#8208;assembled by ultralong CNTs and short CNTs in a one&#8208;step floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition process. The SCNTN&#8208;based airflow sensors achieved a record&#8208;breaking short response time of 0.021 s, a high sensitivity of 0.0124 s m&#8722;1, a small detection threshold of 0.11 m s&#8722;1, and a wide detection range of &#8776;0.11&#8211;5.51 m s&#8722;1, superior to most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art airflow sensors. To reveal the sensing mechanism, an acoustic response testing system and a mathematical model are developed. It is found that the airflow&#8208;caused intertube stress change resulted in the resistance variation of SCNTNs.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with Rec.2020 Blue Gamut Compliance and EQE Over 22% Achieved by Conformation Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>

Conformational heterogeneity in bulky&#8208;group&#8208;shielded deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters enables suppression of spectral broadening, redshifting, and concentration quenching. Devices based on the emitter present high external quantum efficiency up to 22.35% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and color indices close to Rec.2020 blue gamut over a wide doping range of 10&#8211;50 wt%.








Abstract
To achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence satisfying Rec.2020 standard blue gamut, two thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters are developed: 5&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;10,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,e][1,4]azasiline (TDBA&#8208;PAS) and 10&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (TDBA&#8208;DPAC). Inheriting from their parented organoboron multi&#8208;resonance core, both emitters show very promising deep&#8208;blue emissions with relatively narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM, &#8776;50&#160;nm in solution), high photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 92.3%), and short emission lifetime (&#8804;2.49&#160;&#181;s) with fast reverse intersystem crossing (&gt;106 s&#8722;1) in doped films. More importantly, replacing the spiro&#8208;centered sp3 C atom (TDBA&#8208;DPAC) with the larger&#8208;radius sp3 Si atom (TDBA&#8208;PAS), enhanced conformational heterogeneities in bulky&#8208;group&#8208;shielded TADF molecules are observed in solution, doped film, and device. Consequently, OLEDs based on TDBA&#8208;PAS retain high maximum external quantum efficiencies &#8776;20% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and color index close to Rec.2020 blue gamut over a wide doping range of 10&#8211;50 wt%. This study highlights a new strategy to restrain spectral broadening and redshifting and efficiency roll&#8208;off in the design of deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters.

         <title>A Binary Hydrate&#8208;Melt Electrolyte with Acetate&#8208;Oriented Cross&#8208;Linking Solvation Shells for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte with a new solvation structures is developed. In such an electrolyte, the carboxylate groups in OAc&#8722; can bond with the H2O molecules in their neighboring solvation structures, achieving a cross&#8208;linked H&#8208;bond network. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution reaction and by&#8208;product formation are remarkably restricted on Zn anodes in the hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with low cost and high safety are promising energy&#8208;storage devices. However, ZIBs with metal Zn anodes usually suffer from low coulombic efficiency and poor cycling performance due to the occurrence of side reactions on the Zn anodes. Here, a binary hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte is designed to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction and by&#8208;product formation on Zn anodes by adjusting the Zn2+ solvation structure. In the solvation structure of the hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte, the carboxylate group in OAc&#8722; will coordinate with the Zn2+, which will weaken the interaction between Zn2+ and H2O molecules to achieve higher ionization energy of H2O molecules. Simultaneously, these carboxylate groups of OAc&#8722; can serve as H&#8208;bond acceptors to construct H&#8208;bonds with H2O molecules in their neighboring solvation structures, forming a cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network. Such a cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network further suppresses the water activity in ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte. As a result, in such an electrolyte, the side reactions are effectively restricted on Zn anodes and thus Zn anodes can achieve a high coulombic efficiency of 99.59% even after cycling. To illustrate the feasibility of the ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte in aqueous ZIBs, Zn||p&#8208;chloranil cells are assembled based on the ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte. The resultant Zn||p&#8208;chloranil cells exhibit enhanced cycling performance compared with the cases with a conventional ZnSO4 electrolyte.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Material Design Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics without Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed balance theory is applied to explore the performance potential for semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) based on complementary near&#8208;infrared materials. With this theory, ATT&#8208;9 with an optimal ultranarrow bandgap is designed and synthesized. The near&#8208;infrared blend PTB7&#8208;Th:ATT&#8208;9 featuring an ultralow Urbach energy achieves multifunctional ST&#8208;OPVs with an excellent light utilization efficiency and heat&#8208;insulation performance exceeding commercial 3M films.








Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) have drawn great attention for promising applications in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, providing additional power generation for daily use. A previously proposed strategy, &#8220;complementary NIR absorption,&#8221; is widely applied for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs.

&lt;p&gt;Detailed balance theory is applied to explore the performance potential for semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST-OPVs) based on complementary near-infrared materials. With this theory, &lt;b&gt;ATT-9&lt;/b&gt; with an optimal ultranarrow bandgap is designed and synthesized. The near-infrared blend PTB7-Th:&lt;b&gt;ATT-9&lt;/b&gt; featuring an ultralow Urbach energy achieves multifunctional ST-OPVs with an excellent light utilization efficiency and heat-insulation performance exceeding commercial 3M films.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST-OPVs) have drawn great attention for promising applications in building-integrated photovoltaics, providing additional power generation for daily use. A previously proposed strategy, &#8220;complementary NIR absorption,&#8221; is widely applied for high-performance ST-OPVs. However, rational material design toward high performance has not been achieved. In this work, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) model describing this strategy is developed to explore the full potential of material design on ST-OPV performance. Guided by the model, a novel nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), &lt;b&gt;ATT-9&lt;/b&gt;, is designed and synthesized, which possesses optimal bandgap for ST-OPVs, achieving a record short-circuit current density of 30&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a power conversion efficiency of 13.40%, the highest value among devices based on NFAs with bandgaps lower than 1.2&#160;eV. It is notworthy that, at such a low bandgap, the energy loss of the device is only 0.58&#160;eV, which is attributed to the low energetic disorder confirmed by an ultralow Urbach energy of 21.6 meV. Benefiting from the optimal bandgap and low energy loss, the &lt;b&gt;ATT-9&lt;/b&gt;-based ST-OPV achieves a high light utilization efficiency of 3.33% without optical modulations, and meanwhile shows excellent thermal insulation, exceeding the commercial 3M heat-insulating window film, demonstrating the outstanding application prospects of multifunctional ST-OPVs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A comprehensive optimization strategy, including 2&#8208;phenylethylammonium ligand (PEA+)&#8208;passivated FAPbI3 quantum dots (QDs), synergistic coverage effects between the QDs and hole&#8208;transporting layers, and effective electron&#8208;transporting layers for constructing a feasible device structure leads to a high&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared (NIR) QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) centered at 772&#160;nm and exhibiting a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 15.4%, the highest external quantum efficiency recorded for perovskite&#8208;based NIR QLEDs.








Abstract
In recent years, the performance of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) and QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) has improved greatly, with electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of green and red emission exceeding 20%. However, the development of perovskite near&#8208;infrared (NIR) QLEDs has reached stagnation, where the reported maximum EL efficiency is still below 6%, limiting their further applications. In this work, new NIR&#8208;emissive FAPbI3 QDs are developed by post&#8208;treating long alkyl&#8208;encapsulated QDs with 2&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The incorporation of PEAI reduces the QD surface defects for giving a high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 61.6%. The n&#8208;octane solution of PEAI&#8208;passivated FAPbI3 QDs is spin coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS&#8208;treated ITO electrode modified with a thermally crosslinked hole&#8208;transporting layer to give a full&#8208;coverage, smooth, and dense QD film. Incorporating with an effective electron&#8208;transporting material, CN&#8208;T2T, which has deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and good electron mobility, the optimal device with EL &#955;max at 772&#160;nm achieves an external quantum efficiency up to 15.4% at a current density of 0.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (2.6&#160;V), which is the highest efficiency ever reported for perovskite&#8208;based NIR QLEDs. This study provides a facile strategy to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite QD films suitable for highly efficient NIR QLED applications.

         <title>Nanostructured, Fluid&#8208;Bicontinuous Gels for Continuous&#8208;Flow Liquid&#8211;Liquid Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nightmare of each plumber is a large network of entangled and branched pipes. In this work, this assembly is realized for pipes with diameters of a few hundred nanometers. Water is pumped through the network and solute molecules are exchanged between adjacent pipes. This liquid&#8211;liquid extraction process demonstrates the potential for continuous&#8208;flow molecular separations, important for a sustainable chemical industry.








Abstract
Fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels are unique materials that allow two distinct fluids to interact through a percolating, rigid scaffold. Current restrictions for their use are the large fluid&#8208;channel sizes (&gt;5&#160;&#181;m), limiting the fluid&#8211;fluid interaction surface&#8208;area, and the inability to flow liquids through the channels. In this work a scalable synthesis route of nanoparticle stabilized fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels with channels sizes below 500&#160;nm and specific surface areas of 2 m2 cm&#8722;3 is introduced. Moreover, it is demonstrated that liquids can be pumped through the fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels via electroosmosis. The fast liquid flow in the fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gel facilitates their use for molecular separations in continuous&#8208;flow liquid&#8211;liquid extraction. Together with the high surface areas, liquid flow through fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels enhances their potential as highly permeable porous materials with possible uses as microreaction media, fuel&#8208;cell components, and separation membranes.

         <title>Ferroelastic&#8211;Ferroelectric Multiferroicity in van der Waals Rhenium Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroic materials can switch orientations of crystal structure and polarization with external strain. 2D ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroicity in single&#8208;crystalline rhenium dichalcogenides is discovered. Reorientation of the physical properties based on reversible bond switching between the rhenium atoms provides insights for 2D multiferroic phase transitions and opens up new opportunities for applications such as multilevel memory.








Abstract
2D multiferroics with combined ferroic orders have gained attention owing to their novel functionality and underlying science. Intrinsic ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroicity in single&#8208;crystalline van der Waals rhenium dichalcogenides, whose symmetries are broken by the Peierls distortion and layer&#8208;stacking order, is demonstrated. Ferroelastic switching of the domain orientation and accompanying anisotropic properties is achieved with 1% uniaxial strain using the polymer encapsulation method. Based on the electron localization function and bond dissociation energy of the Re&#8211;Re bonds, the change in bond configuration during the evolution of the domain wall and the preferred switching between the two specific orientation states are explained. Furthermore, the ferroelastic switching of ferroelectric polarization is confirmed using the photovoltaic effect. The study provides insights into the reversible bond&#8208;switching process and potential applications based on 2D multiferroicity.

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Organometal Halide Perovskite Nanowalls Grown by Glancing&#8208;Angle Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vacuum&#8208;based approach, compatible with most substrates, for the fabrication of aligned organometal halide perovskite vertical nanowalls by glancing&#8208;angle deposition, is presented. Their alignment provides the samples with strong anisotropic properties, such as photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization&#8208;sensitive response, a milestone for the development of self&#8208;powered photodetectors.








Abstract
Polarizers are ubiquitous components in current optoelectronic devices as displays or photographic cameras. Yet, control over light polarization is an unsolved challenge, since the main drawback of the existing display technologies is the significant optical losses. In such a context, organometal halide perovskites (OMHP) can play a decisive role given their flexible synthesis with tunable optical properties such as bandgap and photoluminescence, and excellent light emission with a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate. Therefore, along with their outstanding electrical properties have elevated hybrid perovskites as the material of choice in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Among the different OMHP nanostructures, nanowires and nanorods have lately arisen as key players in the control of light polarization for lighting or detector applications. Herein, the fabrication of highly aligned and anisotropic methylammonium lead iodide perovskite nanowalls by glancing&#8208;angle deposition, which is compatible with most substrates, is presented. Their high alignment degree provides the samples with anisotropic optical properties such as light absorption and photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization&#8208;sensitive response. This facile vacuum&#8208;based approach embodies a milestone in the development of last&#8208;generation polarization&#8208;sensitive perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as lighting appliances or self&#8208;powered photodetectors.

&lt;p&gt;A novel vacuum-based approach, compatible with most substrates, for the fabrication of aligned organometal halide perovskite vertical nanowalls by glancing-angle deposition, is presented. Their alignment provides the samples with strong anisotropic properties, such as photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization-sensitive response, a milestone for the development of self-powered photodetectors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polarizers are ubiquitous components in current optoelectronic devices as displays or photographic cameras. Yet, control over light polarization is an unsolved challenge, since the main drawback of the existing display technologies is the significant optical losses. In such a context, organometal halide perovskites (OMHP) can play a decisive role given their flexible synthesis with tunable optical properties such as bandgap and photoluminescence, and excellent light emission with a low non-radiative recombination rate. Therefore, along with their outstanding electrical properties have elevated hybrid perovskites as the material of choice in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Among the different OMHP nanostructures, nanowires and nanorods have lately arisen as key players in the control of light polarization for lighting or detector applications. Herein, the fabrication of highly aligned and anisotropic methylammonium lead iodide perovskite nanowalls by glancing-angle deposition, which is compatible with most substrates, is presented. Their high alignment degree provides the samples with anisotropic optical properties such as light absorption and photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization-sensitive response. This facile vacuum-based approach embodies a milestone in the development of last-generation polarization-sensitive perovskite-based optoelectronic devices such as lighting appliances or self-powered photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Conjugated Polymer Nanoplatform for Activatable Companion Diagnostics and Multistage Augmented Synergistic Therapy</title>

A glucose&#8208;oxidase&#8208;based nanoplatform simultaneously realizes photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;based companion diagnostics, photothermal/starvation therapy, and real&#8208;time monitoring of cancer treatment.








Abstract
Companion diagnostics (CDx) provides critical information for precision medicine. However, current CDx is mostly limited to in vitro tests, which cannot accurately evaluate the disease progression and treatment response in real time. To overcome this challenge, herein a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered conjugated polymer (polyaniline, PANI) nanoplatform (denoted as PANITG) is reported for activatable imaging&#8208;based CDx and multistage augmented photothermal/starvation synergistic therapy. PANITG comprises a pH&#8208;activatable conjugated polymer as a photothermal convertor and photoacoustic (PA) emitter, a GOx as a cancer starvation inducer as well as a H2O2 and acid producer, and a H2O2&#8208;cleavable linker as a &#8220;switch&#8221; for GOx activity. The in vivo PA imaging and photothermal therapy abilities are activated by acidic tumor microenvironment and self&#8208;augmented by the reaction between GOx and glucose. Meanwhile, the photothermal effect will enhance the GOx activity in turn. Such multistage augmentation of the therapeutic effects will facilitate effective cancer management. In addition, the in vivo PA imaging with PANITG reveals the tumor pH level which is correlated to the efficiency of the photothermal therapy and to the catalytic activity of GOx at each stage, enabling real&#8208;time activatable CDx.

         <title>A Fully Solution&#8208;Printed Photosynaptic Transistor Array with Ultralow Energy Consumption for Artificial&#8208;Vision Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully solution&#8208;printed photosynaptic organic field&#8208;effect transistor is developed by introducing a source Schottky barrier. Both working voltage and current are substantially lowered, giving rise to an ultralow energy consumptions of 0.07&#8211;34 fJ per spike in short&#8208;term plasticity and 0.41&#8211;19.87 fJ per spike in long&#8208;term plasticity, which are comparable with biological synapses.








Abstract
Photosynaptic organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) represent a viable pathway to develop bionic optoelectronics. However, the high operating voltage and current of traditional photosynaptic OFETs lead to huge energy consumption greater than that of the real biological synapses, hindering their further development in new&#8208;generation visual prosthetics and artificial perception systems. Here, a fully solution&#8208;printed photosynaptic OFET (FSP&#8208;OFET) with substantial energy consumption reduction is reported, where a source Schottky barrier is introduced to regulate charge&#8208;carrier injection, and which operates with a fundamentally different mechanism from traditional devices. The FSP&#8208;OFET not only significantly lowers the working voltage and current but also provides extraordinary neuromorphic light&#8208;perception capabilities. Consequently, the FSP&#8208;OFET successfully emulates visual nervous responses to external light stimuli with ultralow energy consumption of 0.07&#8211;34 fJ per spike in short&#8208;term plasticity and 0.41&#8211;19.87 fJ per spike in long&#8208;term plasticity, both approaching the energy efficiency of biological synapses (1&#8211;100 fJ). Moreover, an artificial optic&#8208;neural network made from an 8 &#215; 8 FSP&#8208;OFET array on a flexible substrate shows excellent image recognition and reinforcement abilities at a low energy cost. The designed FSP&#8208;OFET offers an opportunity to realize photonic neuromorphic functionality with extremely low energy consumption dissipation.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Embedded with Zincophilic Cu Nanoboxes for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D framework consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (Cu NBs@NCFs) is constructed as a multifunctional host for dendrite&#8208;free and stable Zn anodes. Benefiting from the macroporous network, hollow structures, and rich zincophilic sites, the Cu NBs@NCFs host shows low voltage hysteresis, high Coulombic efficiency, and impressive cycling stability in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The practical application of Zn&#8208;metal anodes (ZMAs) is mainly impeded by the limited lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) resulting from the Zn dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a 3D multifunctional host consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (denoted as Cu NBs@NCFs) is rationally designed and developed for stable ZMAs. The 3D macroporous configuration and hollow structure can lower the local current density and alleviate the large volume change during the repeated cycling processes. Furthermore, zincophilic Cu and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Cu&#8211;Zn alloy can act as homogeneous nucleation sites to minimize the Zn nucleation overpotential, further guiding uniform and dense Zn deposition. As a result, this Cu NBs@NCFs host exhibits high CE of Zn plating/stripping for 1000 cycles. The Cu NBs@NCFs&#8211;Zn electrode shows low voltage hysteresis and prolonged cycling life (450 h) with dendrite&#8208;free behaviors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a Zn&#8208;ion full cell is fabricated based on this Cu NBs@NCFs&#8211;Zn anode, which demonstrates decent rate capability and improved cycling performance.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Encoding Free&#8208;Standing RNA Hydrogel for Sub&#8208;Compartmentalized Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and robust RNA hydrogel is developed as a result of rolling circle transcription possessing RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes. Selective catalytic activity and enhanced production of proteins in a sub&#8208;compartmentalized system are observed. This innovative gel technology will expand the current realm of RNA research and create an impact on the RNA principles and applications from the bench to the clinic.








Abstract
RNA can self&#8208;fold into complex structures that can serve as major biological regulators in protein synthesis and in catalysis. Due to the abundance of structural primitives and functional diversity, RNA has been utilized for designing nature&#8208;defined goals despite its intrinsic chemical instability and lack of technologies. Here, a robust, free&#8208;standing RNA hydrogel is developed through a sequential process involving both ligation and rolling circle transcription to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes, capable of both catalytic activity and enhancing expression of several proteins in sub&#8208;compartmentalized, phase&#8208;separated translation environments. The observations suggest that this hydrogel will expand RNA research and impact practical RNA principles and applications.

         <title>Unveiling the Interaction Mechanisms of Electron and X&#8208;ray Radiation with Halide Perovskite Semiconductors using Scanning Nanoprobe Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution microscopy using nanoprobe diffraction reveals spatially resolved changes in the local crystal structure of halide perovskite films upon irradiation with high&#8208;energy electrons and X&#8208;rays. High&#8208;angle defective grain boundaries trigger the formation of degradation phases, leading to changes in the crystal structure. Targeting high&#8208;angle grain boundaries is critical for film stability under high&#8208;energy radiation conditions, especially for space photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
The interaction of high&#8208;energy electrons and X&#8208;ray photons with beam&#8208;sensitive semiconductors such as halide perovskites is essential for the characterization and understanding of these optoelectronic materials. Using nanoprobe diffraction techniques, which can investigate physical properties on the nanoscale, studies of the interaction of electron and X&#8208;ray radiation with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art (FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 hybrid halide perovskite films (FA, formamidinium; MA, methylammonium) are performed, tracking the changes in the local crystal structure as a function of fluence using scanning electron diffraction and synchrotron nano X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. Perovskite grains are identified, from which additional reflections, corresponding to PbBr2, appear as a crystalline degradation phase after fluences of 200 e&#8722; &#197;&#8722;2. These changes are concomitant with the formation of small PbI2 crystallites at the adjacent high&#8208;angle grain boundaries, with the formation of pinholes, and with a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic. A similar degradation pathway is caused by photon irradiation in nano&#8208;X&#8208;ray diffraction, suggesting common underlying mechanisms. This approach explores the radiation limits of these materials and provides a description of the degradation pathways on the nanoscale. Addressing high&#8208;angle grain boundaries will be critical for the further improvement of halide polycrystalline film stability, especially for applications vulnerable to high&#8208;energy radiation such as space photovoltaics.

         <title>Magnon&#8208;Coupled Intralayer Moir&#233; Trion in Monolayer Semiconductor&#8211;Antiferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; patterns of van der Waals heterostructures offer a powerful platform for engineering excitonic states, leading to the formation of moir&#233; excitonic states. However, interactions between moir&#233; excitonic states and magnetic elementary excitations are not studied. In this work, a moir&#233; excitonic system interacting with an antiferromagnetic order in a monolayer MoSe2 and an antiferromagnetic MnPS3 heterostructure is reported.








Abstract
Moir&#233; fringe patterns created by stacking different 2D layered materials as artificial van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have become a novel platform to study and engineer optically generated excitonic properties. The moir&#233; patterns contribute to the formation of spatially ordered excitonic states (excitons and trions), which can be used in the quantum simulation of many&#8208;body systems and ensembles of coherent quantum light emitters. The intriguing moir&#233; excitonic properties are affected by and controlled via the interaction with magnetic elements. Here, a moir&#233; excitonic system interacting with the magnetic elementary excitation of antiferromagnetic orders in MoSe2/MnPS3 vdW heterostructures is reported. The low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence spectra with additional fine spectral structures on the low&#8208;energy side, which are coupled magnon&#8211;trion peaks below the N&#233;el temperature of MnPS3, are carefully investigated. The fine spectral structures with long lifetime and coherence time are assigned to intralayer trion&#8211;magnon complexes trapped in the moir&#233; potentials (moir&#233; trion&#8211;magnon complexes). These findings highlight the emergence of moir&#233; trion&#8211;magnon complexes and provide a new way to explore novel quantum phenomena in moir&#233; excitonic systems with magnetic functionalities.

         <title>Reducing Contact Resistance and Boosting Device Performance of Monolayer MoS2 by In Situ Fe Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable Fe doping strategy is developed in centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer MoS2 films with ultralow contact resistance. Excellent device performance featured with ultrahigh electron mobility and on/off current ratio is achieved, thanks to the ultralow electron effective mass. Unidirectional Fe&#8208;MoS2 domains are prepared on 2 in. commercial c&#8208;plane sapphire, suggesting the feasibility of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal semiconductors with outstanding device performance.








Abstract
2D semiconductors are emerging as plausible candidates for next&#8208;generation &#8220;More&#8208;than&#8208;Moore&#8221; nanoelectronics to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WS2, have been successfully synthesized recently; nevertheless, the absence of effective doping technology fundamentally results in energy barriers and high contact resistances at the metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces, and thus restrict their practical applications. Herein, a controllable doping strategy in centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer MoS2 films is developed to address this critical issue and boost the device performance. The ultralow contact resistance and perfect Ohmic contact with metal electrodes are uncovered in monolayer Fe&#8208;doped MoS2, which deliver excellent device performance featured with ultrahigh electron mobility and outstanding on/off current ratio. Impurity scattering is suppressed significantly thanks to the ultralow electron effective mass and appropriate doping site. Particularly, unidirectionally aligned monolayer Fe&#8208;doped MoS2 domains are prepared on 2 in. commercial c&#8208;plane sapphire, suggesting the feasibility of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale 2D single&#8208;crystal semiconductors with outstanding device performance. This work presents the potential of high&#8208;performance monolayer transistors and enables further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.

         <title>A Gradient pH&#8208;Sensitive Polymer&#8208;Based Antiviral Strategy via Viroporin&#8208;Induced Membrane Acidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to develop potent and broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. Gradient pH&#8208;sensitive polymeric nanoprobes are designed for accurate measurement of the cellular membrane acidification induced by virus infection. In response to acidified membranes, one of the polymers selectively targets to virus&#8208;infected cells and viruses, eventually lysing viral envelopes and exerting powerful activities against a variety of viruses.








Abstract
Lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;targeting strategies hold great promise to develop broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. However, it remains a big challenge to identify novel membrane&#8208;based targets of viruses and virus&#8208;infected cells for development of precision targeted approaches. Here, it is discovered that viroporins, viral&#8208;encoded ion channels, which have been reported to mediate release of hydrogen ions, trigger membrane acidification of virus&#8208;infected cells. Through development of a fine&#8208;scale library of gradient pH&#8208;sensitive (GPS) polymeric nanoprobes, the cellular membrane pH transitions are measured from pH 6.8&#8211;7.1 (uninfection) to pH 6.5&#8211;6.8 (virus&#8208;infection). In response to the subtle pH alterations, the GPS polymer with sharp response at pH 6.8 (GPS6.8) selectively binds to virus&#8208;infected cell membranes or the viral envelope, and even completely disrupts the viral envelope. Accordingly, GPS6.8 treatment exerts suppressive effects on a wide variety of viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 through triggering viral&#8208;envelope lysis rather than affecting immune pathway or viability of host cells. Murine viral&#8208;infection models exhibit that supplementation of GPS6.8 decreases viral titers and ameliorates inflammatory damage. Thus, the gradient pH&#8208;sensitive nanotechnology offers a promising strategy for accurate detection of biological pH environments and robust interference with viruses.

         <title>A Selective Targeting Anchor Strategy Affords Efficient and Stable Ideal&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming for hybrid perovskite solar cells, a novel strategy is developed that using ethylenediamine diiodide and phenethylammonium iodide as co&#8208;modifiers to selectively targeting anchor with lead&#8211;tin binary perovskite materials, resulting in comprehensively healing the dual&#8208;sourced defects. As a result, a champion efficiency of 22.51% is achieved, which is the record efficiency among the ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Mixed lead&#8211;tin perovskite solar cells (LTPSCs) with an ideal bandgap are demonstrated as a promising candidate to reach higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than their Pb&#8208;counterparts. Herein, a Br&#8208;free mixed lead&#8211;tin perovskite material, FA0.8MA0.2Pb0.8Sn0.2I3, with a bandgap of 1.33&#160;eV, as a perovskite absorber, is selected. Through density functional theory calculations and optoelectronic techniques, it is demonstrated that both Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related A&#8208;site vacancies are pushed into deeper energetic depth, causing severe nonradiative recombination. Hence, a selective targeting anchor strategy that employs phenethylammonium iodide and ethylenediamine diiodide as co&#8208;modifiers to selectively anchor with Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related active sites and passivate bimetallic traps, respectively, is established. Furthermore, the selectivity of the molecular oriented anchor passivation is demonstrated through energetic depth specificity of Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related traps. As a result, a substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 0.79 to 0.90 V for the LTPSCs is achieved, yielding a champion PCE of 22.51%, which is the highest PCE among the reported ideal&#8208;bandgap PSCs. The VOC loss is reduced to 0.43&#160;V.

         <title>Accurately Localizing Multiple Nanoparticles in a Multishelled Matrix Through Shell&#8208;to&#8208;Core Evolution for Maximizing Energy&#8208;Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate structure of multiple cores localized separately in a hollow multishelled matrix is developed and achieved through a facile synthesis strategy of &#8220;in situ evolution of shell to core&#8221;. Such a structure could benefit charge diffusion, buffer the volume expansion, and stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase, thus enabling the high&#8208;capacity electrode material to realize nearly its theoretical lithium&#8208;storage capability.








Abstract
Robust and fast lithium energy storage with a high energy density is highly desired to accelerate the market adoption of electric vehicles. To realize such a goal requires the development of electrode materials with a high capacity, however, such electrode materials suffer from huge volume expansion and induced short cycling life. Here, using tin (Sn) as an example, an ideal structure is designed to effectively solve these problems by separately localizing multiple Sn nanoparticles in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon hollow multishelled structure with duplicated layers for carbon shell (Sn NPs@NxC HoMS&#8208;DL). The fabricated composite can promote ion and electron diffusion owing to the conductive network formed by connected multiple shells and cores, effectively buffer the volume expansion, and maintain a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. Despite the challenging fabrication, such a structure is realized through an innovative and facile synthesis strategy of &#8220;in situ evolution of shell to core&#8221;, which is applicable for diverse low&#8208;melting&#8208;point materials. As expected, such a structure enables the high&#8208;capacity electrode material to realize nearly its theoretical lithium&#8208;storage capability: the developed Sn NPs@NxC HoMS&#8208;DL electrode maintains 96% of its theoretical capacity after 2000 cycles at 2C.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Defective and Porous Ir Metallene with Polyallylamine for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyallylamine&#8208;wrapped Ir metallene with a defective and porous structure is fabricated by a one&#8208;step wet chemical reduction method. The abundance of defects and pores and the surface functionalization of the Ir metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity, efficient mass transport/diffusion, and tunable electronic structure, resulting in excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performance.








Abstract
The design of defects and porous structures into metallene with functional surfaces is highly desired to improve its permeability, surface area, and active sites, but remains a great challenge. In this work, polyallylamine&#8208;encapsulated Ir metallene with defects and porous structure (Ir@PAH metallene) is easily fabricated by a one&#8208;step wet chemical reduction method. The Ir@PAH metallene exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of only 14&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, a low Tafel slope of 31.2&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, and almost no activity decay after stability test. The abundant defects and pores as well as several&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer nanosheet structures of Ir@PAH metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and efficient mass transport/diffusion. In addition, surface&#8208;functionalized PAH molecules can modulate the electronic structure through strong Ir&#8211;N interaction and act as proton carriers to capture hydrogen ions, which is very beneficial for the HER in acidic media. This work provides a useful strategy for the synthesis of the defective and porous metallene with functionalized surfaces for various catalytic applications.

         <title>Chemical Passivation Stabilizes Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical passivation of Zn surface is achieved by a simple treatment in a solution of strong oxidant such as KMnO4, which drastically improves its electrochemical cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are an attractive option for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, which is vital to the integration of renewable energy resources with the electric energy infrastructure. The cycling stability of aqueous ZIBs is determined by the electrochemical reversibility of Zn anode, which is often deteriorated by its corrosion and dendritic Zn deposition. Here, a simple and rapid surface passivation strategy that can drastically improve the cycling stability of Zn anodes is demonstrated. For example, a dip in KMnO4 solution readily forms a continuous, conformal, and robust protective layer on the native Zn surface, leading to a more uniform plating/stripping process, increased corrosion resistance, and tolerance to manufacturing and processing defects on Zn metal electrodes. The Zn electrode cycling stabilities at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 are extended by &#8776;40 times. In full battery tests in the configuration of Zn||&#946;&#8208;MnO2, the full cell with passivated Zn anode exhibited a capacity retention of 68.7% after 300 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g&#8722;1, while the cell with untreated Zn anode can only retain 7.4% of capacity under the same conditions.

         <title>Integrated Afterglow and Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Hybrid Metal Halides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to modulate the afterglow and self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emissions in 0D (Ph3S)2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 (x = 0&#8211;1) single crystals. Moreover, the integration of afterglow and STE emissions is realized in (Ph3S)2Sn0.92Te0.08Cl6. These as&#8208;prepared 0D hybrid metal halides with colorful emissions are demonstrated for multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage applications.








Abstract
0D hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) are considered to be promising luminescent emitters. 0D HMHs commonly exhibit self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emissions originating from the inorganic metal halide anion units. Exploring and utilizing the emission features of the organic cation units in 0D HMHs is highly desired to enrich their optical properties as multifunctional luminescent materials. Here, tunable emissions from organic and inorganic units are successfully achieved in triphenylsulfonium (Ph3S+)&#8208;based 0D HMHs. Notably, integrated afterglow and STE emissions with adjustable intensities are obtained in (Ph3S)2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;1) via the delicate combination of [SnCl6]2&#8722; and [TeCl6]2&#8722;. Moreover, such a strategy can be readily extended to develop other HMH materials with intriguing optical properties. As a demonstration, 0D (Ph3S)2Zn1&#8722;xMnxCl4 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;1) are constructed to achieve integrated afterglow and Mn2+ d&#8211;d emissions with high efficiency.

     alt="Integrated Afterglow and Self-Trapped Exciton Emissions in Hybrid Metal Halides for Anti-Counterfeiting Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy is developed to modulate the afterglow and self-trapped exciton (STE) emissions in 0D (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (x = 0&#8211;1) single crystals. Moreover, the integration of afterglow and STE emissions is realized in (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. These as-prepared 0D hybrid metal halides with colorful emissions are demonstrated for multiple anti-counterfeiting and information storage applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0D hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) are considered to be promising luminescent emitters. 0D HMHs commonly exhibit self-trapped exciton (STE) emissions originating from the inorganic metal halide anion units. Exploring and utilizing the emission features of the organic cation units in 0D HMHs is highly desired to enrich their optical properties as multifunctional luminescent materials. Here, tunable emissions from organic and inorganic units are successfully achieved in triphenylsulfonium (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-based 0D HMHs. Notably, integrated afterglow and STE emissions with adjustable intensities are obtained in (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0&#8211;1) via the delicate combination of [SnCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [TeCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, such a strategy can be readily extended to develop other HMH materials with intriguing optical properties. As a demonstration, 0D (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Mn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0&#8211;1) are constructed to achieve integrated afterglow and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; d&#8211;d emissions with high efficiency. Consequently, these novel 0D HMHs with colorful afterglow and STE emissions are applied in multiple anti-counterfeiting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Tough Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Flexible Ultralong&#8208;Life Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>

A tough, intrinsic hydroxide&#8208;conductive, bioinspired solid&#8208;state electrolyte is designed for flexible ultralong&#8208;life zinc&#8211;air batteries, which is featured of dynamic dual&#8208;penetrating network structure with the synergism of ionomer and molecular polymer and gracefully obtains excellent comprehensive properties of mechanical robustness, high ion conductivity and good water retention.








Abstract
Manufacturing advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for flexible rechargeable batteries becomes increasingly important but remains grand challenge. The sophisticated structure of robust animal dermis and good water&#8208;retention of plant cell in nature grant germane inspirations for designing high&#8208;performance SSEs. Herein, tough bioinspired SSEs with intrinsic hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) conduction are constructed by in situ formation of OH&#8722; conductive ionomer network within a hollow&#8208;polymeric&#8208;microcapsule&#8208;decorated hydrogel polymer network. By virtue of the bioinspired design and dynamic dual&#8208;penetrating network structure, the bioinspired SSEs simultaneously obtain mechanical robustness with 1800% stretchability, good water uptake of 107&#160;g g&#8722;1 and water retention, and superhigh ion conductivity of 215 mS cm&#8722;1. The nanostructure of bioinspired SSE and related ion&#8208;conduction mechanism are revealed and visualized by molecular dynamics simulation, where plenty of compact and superfast ion&#8208;transport channels are constructed, contributing to superhigh ion conductivity. As a result, the flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries assembled with bioinspired SSEs witness high power density of 148 mW cm&#8722;2, specific capacity of 758 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultralong cycling stability of 320 h as well as outstanding flexibility. The bioinspired methodology and deep insight of ion&#8208;conduction mechanism will shed light on the design of advanced SSEs for flexible energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Biobased Elastomer Nanofibers Guide Light&#8208;Controlled Human&#8208;iPSC&#8208;Derived Skeletal Myofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastomeric nanofiber sheets, made from a new biobased nanohybrid polymer, support the differentiation and contractile function of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived skeletal muscle fibers. The controlled alignment of nanofibers provides extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like guidance, promoting myofiber differentiation and maturation. The hyperelastic properties of the elastomer nanofibers stabilize optogenetically activate contractions and promote culture longevity.








Abstract
Generating skeletal muscle tissue that mimics the cellular alignment, maturation, and function of native skeletal muscle is an ongoing challenge in disease modeling and regenerative therapies. Skeletal muscle cultures require extracellular guidance and mechanical support to stabilize contractile myofibers. Existing microfabrication&#8208;based solutions are limited by complex fabrication steps, low throughput, and challenges in measuring dynamic contractile function. Here, the synthesis and characterization of a new biobased nanohybrid elastomer, which is electrospun into aligned nanofiber sheets to mimic the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, is presented. The polymer exhibits remarkable hyperelasticity well&#8208;matched to that of native skeletal muscle (&#8776;11&#8211;50&#160;kPa), with ultimate strain &#8776;1000%, and elastic modulus &#8776;25&#160;kPa.&#160;Uniaxially aligned nanofibers guide myoblast alignment, enhance sarcomere formation, and promote a &#8776;32% increase in myotube fusion and &#8776;50% increase in myofiber maturation. The elastomer nanofibers stabilize optogenetically&#160;controlled human induced pluripotent stem cell derived skeletal myofibers. When activated by blue light, the myofiber&#8211;nanofiber hybrid constructs maintain a significantly higher (&gt;200%) contraction velocity and specific force (&gt;280%) compared to conventional culture methods. The engineered myofibers exhibit a power density of &#8776;35&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;3. This system is a promising new skeletal muscle tissue model for applications in muscular disease modeling, drug discovery, and muscle regeneration.

         <title>Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystal Lithium Titanate Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous single&#8208;crystal architecture is performed on the spinel Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode for ultrafast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The unique interconnected porous structure of LTO microrods significantly shortens the Li+ ion diffusion length and facilitates electrolyte mass transportation. The single&#8208;crystalline nature of these LTO microrods is well preserved even after 10&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
There remain significant challenges in developing fast&#8208;charging materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to sluggish ion diffusion kinetics and unfavorable electrolyte mass transportation in battery electrodes. In this work, a mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline lithium titanate (MSC&#8208;LTO) microrod that can realize exceptional fast charge/discharge performance and excellent long&#8208;term stability in LIBs is reported. The MSC&#8208;LTO microrods are featured with a single&#8208;crystalline structure and interconnected pores inside the entire single&#8208;crystalline body. These features not only shorten the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion distance but also allow for the penetration of electrolytes into the single&#8208;crystalline interior during battery cycling. Hence, the MSC&#8208;LTO microrods exhibit unprecedentedly high rate capability, achieving a specific discharge capacity of &#8776;174 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, which is very close to its theoretical capacity, and &#8776;169 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C. More importantly, the porous single&#8208;crystalline microrods greatly mitigate the structure degradation during a long&#8208;term cycling test, offering &#8776;92% of the initial capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 C. This work presents a novel strategy to engineer porous single&#8208;crystalline materials and paves a new venue for developing fast&#8208;charging materials for LIBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk gain media, large&#8208;dimensional resonant cavities, and sizable focusing apparatuses seriously limit the application scope of solar&#8208;powered light sources. Particularly, the miniaturization of solar&#8208;driven photon emitters remains challenging. Here resonant emission from monolayer semiconductor under simulated solar illumination by a white&#8208;light emitting diode is demonstrated, which represents an exciting step toward on&#8208;chip solar&#8208;powered photonic circuits.








Abstract
Resonant emission in photonic structures is very useful to construct all&#8208;photonic circuits for optical interconnects and quantum computing. Optical generation of most resonant&#8208;emitting modes in photonic structures is obtained by coherent pumping rather than incoherent illumination. Particularly, the development of white&#8208;light&#8208; or even solar&#8208;powered on&#8208;chip light sources remains challenging but is very attractive in view of the much facile availability of these incoherent excitation sources. Here, net resonant emission from a monolayer semiconductor is demonstrated under simulated solar illumination by a white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode. The device is formed by embedding a 2D gain medium into a planar microcavity on a silicon wafer, which is compatible with the prevailing on&#8208;chip photonic technology. Coherent and white&#8208;light excitation sources are, respectively, selected for optical pumping, where the output light in two cases exhibits well&#8208;consistent resonant wavelength, linewidth, polarization, location, and Gaussian&#8208;beam profile. The fundamental TEM00 mode behaves as a doublet emission, resulting from anisotropy&#8208;induced non&#8208;degenerate states with orthogonal polarizations. The extraordinary spectral flipping is attributed to the competitive interplay of resonant absorption and emission. This work paves a way toward white&#8208;light or solar&#8208;powered state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photonic applications at the chip scale.

         <title>Creating Composite Vortex Beams with a Single Geometric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact metasurface approach is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to create composite vortex beams. A single geometric metasurface is used to realize the superposition of multiple vortex beams with different circular polarization states. This method provides a compact platform to generate composite vortex beams with engineered singularity distributions, which are fundamentally important for singular optics and quantum science.








Abstract
Composite vortex beams (CVBs) have attracted considerable interest recently due to the unique optical properties and potential applications. However, these beams are mainly generated using spatial light modulators, which suffer from large volume, high cost, and limited resolution. Benefiting from the ultrathin nature and unprecedented capability in light manipulation, optical metasurfaces provide a compact platform to perform this task. A metasurface approach to creating these CVBs is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The design is based on the superposition of multiple circularly polarized vortex beams with different topological charges, which is realized based on a geometric metasurface consisting of metallic nanorods with spatially variant orientations. The effects of the initial phases, amplitude coefficients, incident polarization state, and propagation distance on the generated CVBs, which are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, are experimentally analyzed. This work has opened a new avenue for engineering CVBs with a minimal footprint, which has promising applications ranging from multiple optical traps to quantum science.

         <title>Mobile Phone Flashlight&#8208;Excited Red Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the rational design of organic luminogens with strong intramolecular charge transfer and optimized molecular geometry, the mobile phone flashlight&#8208;excited red afterglow imaging of lymph nodes in living mice is realized for the first time, offering a safe and conventional approach to realize the afterglow imaging of living mice with deep issue penetration and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime possess the remarkable advantage in bioimaging for elimination of background noise by characteristic time scale. However, most of RTP luminogens need to be excited by the harmful ultraviolet (UV) lamp, and exhibit green or yellow emission with shallow tissue penetration, constraining the in vivo bioimaging for further application in clinical diagnosis and pathological study. In this text, the much safer excitation process by sunlight and mobile phone flashlight is realized by organic luminogens with various electronic pull&#8211;push systems. Moreover, the bright red RTP emission with lifetime up to 344&#160;ms is achieved by optimizing molecular geometry and electronic property. Especially, the mobile phone flashlight&#8208;excited red afterglow imaging of lymph nodes in living mice has been realized for the first time, affording a safe and conventional approach to achieve the afterglow imaging of living mice with deep issue penetration and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Micropatterning of Polydopamine by Multiphoton Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine serves as a versatile platform for facile functionalization applicable to almost any surface. In this work, a novel approach of polydopamine deposition applying multiphoton lithography is introduced, resulting in 2D microstructures of complex designs with adjustable morphology and thickness. Reaching sub&#8208;micrometer pattern precision, this approach does not require photomasks or stamps and enables full spatial deposition control.








Abstract
Mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine (PDA) initiates a multifunctional modification route that leads to the generation of novel advanced materials and their applications. However, existing PDA deposition techniques still exhibit poor spatial control, have a very limited capability of micropatterning, and do not allow local tuning of the PDA topography. Herein, PDA deposition based on multiphoton lithography (MPL) is demonstrated, which enables full spatial and temporal control with nearly total freedom of patterning design. Using MPL, 2D microstructures of complex design are achieved with pattern precision of 0.8&#160;&#181;m without the need of a photomask or stamp. Moreover, this approach permits adjusting the morphology and thickness of the fabricated microstructure within one deposition step, resulting in a unique tunability of material properties. The chemical composition of PDA is confirmed and its ability for protein enzyme immobilization is demonstrated. This work presents a new methodology for high&#8208;precision and complete control of PDA deposition, enabling PDA incorporation in applications where fine and precise local surface functionalization is required. Possible applications include multicomponent functional elements and devices in microfluidics or lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Antibacterial Strategies Enabled by Gene&#8208;Transfection and Immunomodulatory Nanoparticles in 3D&#8208;Printed Scaffolds for Synergistic Exogenous and Endogenous Treatment of Infections</title>

LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37 nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a 3D&#8208;printed scaffold address the challenges associated with implant&#8208;related infections. The LL37 peptides grafted on NP surfaces effectively kill recalcitrant pathogens. Intracellular LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37 NPs then release loaded LL37 plasmids, providing a constant supply of LL37. The NPs also alleviate immunosuppression at sites of infection, thus restoring the normal anti&#8208;infection function of the immune system.








Abstract
As research on refractory Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related implant infection intensifies, certain challenges remain, including low antibiotic concentrations within infected areas, immune escape achieved by intracellular bacteria, myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inducing regional immunosuppression, and recurrence of residual pathogenic bacteria after drug suspension. Herein, a novel antimicrobial system to simultaneously address these issues is proposed. Specifically, an oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed scaffold with shell&#8211;core nanoparticles is designed, which are loaded with an antimicrobial peptide plasmid (LL37 plasmid) and have LL37 grafted on their surface (LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37). The surface&#8208;grafted LL37 directly kills S. aureus and, following entry into cells, the nanoparticles kill intracellular bacteria. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo, following translation of the LL37 plasmid, cells function as factories of the antimicrobial peptide, thereby generating a continuous, prolonged antibacterial effect at the site of infection. This system significantly reduces the abnormal increase in MDSCs within the infected microenvironment, thus relieving the immunosuppressive state and restoring a protective antimicrobial immune response. Hence, this proposed antimicrobial system provides an antimicrobial immune response and a novel strategy for S. aureus&#8208;related infections by offering a combined active antimicrobial and immunotherapeutic strategy, thereby significantly reducing the recurrence rate following recovery from implant&#8208;associated infections.

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MI) ligand modulated electronic structure, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As a result, the MI&#8208;modulated catalyst demonstrates ultralow overpotential (230/290&#160;mV at 10/100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2), and robust stability (&gt;155&#160;h).








Abstract
Rationally designed catalysts hold the key to address the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, engineering the active sites of such catalysts still faces grand challenges. This study proposes a feasible ligand modulation strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of cobalt&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide ((Fe,Co)OOH). The 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MI) ligand coordination on (Fe,Co)OOH reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O&#160;2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As a result, the MI ligand modulated (Fe,Co)OOH achieves an excellent OER performance with low overpotentials (230/290&#160;mV at 10/100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2) and excellent durability (&gt;155&#160;h). This study provides a novel ligand modulation strategy for the design of OER catalysts.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Ended Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 Heterostructures Nanocage Anode with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 heterostructures with an open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are accurately designed and synthesized by a selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration method, which displays excellent electrochemical performance as the anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sulfides are perceived as promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and structural diversity. Nonetheless, the poor structural stability and sluggish kinetics of sulfides lead to unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 heterostructures with an open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are well designed as the anode for PIBs via a selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration approach. The hollow Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO nanocages, with large surface area, abundant heterointerfaces, and unique open&#8208;ended nanocage structure, can reduce the K+ diffusion length and promote reaction kinetics. When used as the anode for PIBs, the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO exhibits high reversible capacity and low capacity degradation (0.0089% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1). A potassium&#8208;ion full battery with a Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO anode and Prussian blue cathode can display a superior reversible capacity of 400&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 after 300 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1. The unique structural advantages and electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO are revealed by finite&#8208;element&#8208;simulation in situ characterizations. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic sulfide anodes for advanced PIBs may provide vital guidance to design high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Electrolysis for Co&#8208;Production of Phosphate and Hydrogen in Neutral Phosphate Buffer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2 gas, NaZnPO4, and electric energy can be generated concurrently by a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES), which is driven by the spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O in a neutral PBS solution. The SCES uses a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In the SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. A high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst is synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential.








Abstract
The spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O is of critical importance and could plausibly be used to produce H2 gas, especially under neutral conditions. However, this reaction has long been overlooked owing to its sluggish kinetics and Zn consumption. Herein, a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES) is reported, which uses a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In this SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. Additionally, the composition and phase structure of NaZnPO4 can be well regulated. In this study, a high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst is synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential of 64.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. H2 gas (13.7 mL cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and NaZnPO4 (3.73 mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) are obtained at the cathode and anode, respectively, in the N,Cu&#8208;CoP/CC||Zn SCES spontaneously. Moreover, the SCES has a favorable open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.79 V and a maximum power density of 1.83 mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to elucidate the electronic structure and HER catalytic mechanism of the N and Cu co&#8208;doped CoP catalysts.

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocatalysts Immobilized in Nanoporous Hydrogels for Long&#8208;Term Robust Continuous Glucose Monitoring of Smart Contact Lens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart contact lenses containing bimetallic nanocatalysts immobilized in nanoporous hydrogels are developed for long&#8208;term and robust continuous glucose monitoring. The smart contact lenses can accurately monitor increasing and decreasing blood glucose levels with 92.2% acceptable data in diabetic and normal rabbits. Finally, the clinical feasibility and safety of smart contact lenses are evaluated on the eyes of a human patient.








Abstract
Smart contact lenses for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have great potential for huge clinical impact. To date, their development has been limited by challenges in accurate detection of glucose without hysteresis for tear glucose monitoring to track the blood glucose levels. Here, long&#8208;term robust CGM in diabetic rabbits is demonstrated by using bimetallic nanocatalysts immobilized in nanoporous hydrogels in smart contact lenses. After redox reaction of glucose oxidase, the nanocatalysts facilitate rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and nanoparticle&#8208;mediated charge transfer with drastically improved diffusion via rapid swelling of nanoporous hydrogels. The ocular glucose sensors result in high sensitivity, fast response time, low detection limit, low hysteresis, and rapid sensor warming&#8208;up time. In diabetic rabbits, smart contact lens can detect tear glucose levels consistent with blood glucose levels measured by a glucometer and a CGM device, reflecting rapid concentration changes without hysteresis. The CGM in a human demonstrates the feasibility of smart contact lenses for further clinical applications.

Organometal&#8208;Halide Perovskites
In article number 2107739, &#193;ngel Barranco, Juan Ramon Sanchez&#8208;Valencia, and co&#8208;workers report highly aligned organometal&#8208;halide perovskite vertical nanowalls using a new vacuum&#8208;based approach evolved from the glancing&#8208;angle deposition (GLAD) technique. The alignment and separation degree of the supported nanostructures are governed by the angle of deposition, which for glancing angles provides samples with strong optical anisotropic properties such as polarized&#8208;photoluminescence or polarization&#8208;sensitive photocurrent response.

Mesoporous Materials
In article number 2109356, Jianming Li, Pengfei Yan, Shuhong Jiao, and co&#8208;workers report mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline lithium titanate microrods featured with a single&#8208;crystalline structure and interconnected pores inside for fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The unique structure of lithium titanate enables a short lithium&#8208;ion diffusion distance and fast penetration of electrolytes into the electrode interior during battery cycling, which contribute to high&#8208;rate capability and excellent cycling stability. The novel design of porous single&#8208;crystalline materials paves a new venue for developing fast&#8208;charging materials for LIBs.

Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
A comprehensive optimization strategy leads to high&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), as reported in article 2109785 by Zong&#8208;Liang Tseng, Shun&#8208;Wei Liu, Ken&#8208;Tsung Wong, and co&#8208;workers. Post&#8208;treatment of encapsulated FAPbI3 QDs reduces QD surface defects, and the passivated QDs dispersed in n&#8208;octane are effectively spin&#8208;coated on top of a treated electrode, leading to full&#8208;coverage, smooth, and dense QD films. The resulting QLED devices have electroluminescence &#955;max at 772 nm with external quantum efficiency up to 15.4% at a current density of 0.54 mA cm&#8722;2 (2.6 V).

Airflow Sensors
In article number 2107062, Rufan Zhang and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of suspended carbon nanotube networks (SCNTNs) for high&#8208;performance airflow sensors. Due to the ultralight and flexible nature of CNTs and their unique junction structures, the SCNTN&#8208;based airflow sensors achieve ultrafast response, low detection threshold, high sensitivity, and ultralong cycling lifetime.

         <title>Revisiting the Roles of Natural Graphite in Ongoing Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of natural graphite&#8208;based materials in ongoing lithium&#8208;ion batteries is presented, covering fundamental mechanisms, detailed applications, and an outlook of natural graphite&#8208;based materials, from not only the aspects of structure and properties, modifications, derivatives, and composites, but also perspectives in terms of natural graphite in hybrid lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal cells and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
Graphite, commonly including artificial graphite and natural graphite (NG), possesses a relatively high theoretical capacity of 372&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 and appropriate lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation potential, and has been extensively used as the anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With the requirements of reducing CO2 emission to achieve carbon neutral, the market share of NG anode will continue to grow due to its excellent processability and low production energy consumption. NG, which is abundant in China, can be divided into flake graphite (FG) and microcrystalline graphite (MG). In the past 30 years, many researchers have focused on developing modified NG and its derivatives with superior electrochemical performance, promoting their wide applications in LIBs. Here, a comprehensive overview of the origin, roles, and research progress of NG&#8208;based materials in ongoing LIBs is provided, including their structure, properties, electrochemical performance, modification methods, derivatives, composites, and applications, especially the strategies to improve their high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature charging performance. Prospects regarding the development orientation as well as future applications of NG&#8208;based materials are also considered, which will provide significant guidance for the current and future research of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Electrode Engineering in Halide Perovskite Electronics: Plenty of Room at the Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational selection of electrodes plays a critical role in perovskite&#8208;based electronics due to the high reactivity of halide perovskite materials. A comprehensive review of perovskite/electrode interfaces, as well as, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact engineering, which assists the development of perovskite&#8208;based devices with inhibited interfacial reactions, ohmic carrier transport, and non&#8208;hysteric electronic characteristics, is presented.








Abstract
Contact engineering is a prerequisite for achieving desirable functionality and performance of semiconductor electronics, which is particularly critical for organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites due to their ionic nature and highly reactive interfaces. Although the interfaces between perovskites and charge&#8208;transporting layers have attracted lots of attention due to the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diode applications, achieving reliable perovskite/electrode contacts for electronic devices, such as transistors and memories, remains as a bottleneck. Herein, a critical review on the elusive nature of perovskite/electrode interfaces with a focus on the interfacial electrochemistry effects is presented. The basic guidelines of electrode selection are given for establishing non&#8208;polarized interfaces and optimal energy level alignment for perovskite materials. Furthermore, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies on interface&#8208;related electrode engineering are reviewed and discussed, which aim at achieving ohmic transport and eliminating hysteresis in perovskite devices. The role and multiple functionalities of self&#8208;assembled monolayers that offer a unique approach toward improving perovskite/electrode contacts are also discussed. The insights on electrode engineering pave the way to advancing stable and reliable perovskite devices in diverse electronic applications.

         <dc:description>
Kirigami patterns, inspired by arts of paper&#8208;cutting, provide innovative opportunities for precise structural engineering via material removal. In this report, the design of kirigami&#8208;based conformable systems for biomedical applications is discussed. Factors including cut geometry, materials, and fabrication are covered. Then, applications in healthcare, including sensors, implantable devices, therapeutics, surgical tools, and regenerative medicine are explored.








Abstract
Mechanically flexible and conformable materials and integrated devices have found diverse applications in personalized healthcare as diagnostics and therapeutics, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine constructs, surgical tools, secure systems, and assistive technologies. In order to impart optimal mechanical properties to the (bio)materials used in these applications, various strategies have been explored&#8212;from composites to structural engineering. In recent years, geometric cuts inspired by the art of paper&#8208;cutting, referred to as kirigami, have provided innovative opportunities for conferring precise mechanical properties via material removal. Kirigami&#8208;based approaches have been used for device design in areas ranging from soft bioelectronics to energy storage. In this review, the principles of kirigami&#8208;inspired engineering specifically for biomedical applications are discussed. Factors pertinent to their design, including cut geometry, materials, and fabrication, and the effect these parameters have on their properties and configurations are covered. Examples of kirigami designs in healthcare are presented, such as, various form factors of sensors (on skin, wearable), implantable devices, therapeutics, surgical procedures, and cellular scaffolds for regenerative medicine. Finally, the challenges and future scope for the successful translation of these biodesign concepts to broader deployment are discussed.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;Block Metals in Water Electrolysis: Status Quo and Perspectives</title>

This review pioneeringly presents the unique and essential role of some s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metal species enabling transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts to efficiently drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Transition metals, in particular noble metals, are the most common species in metal&#8208;mediated water electrolysis because they serve as highly active catalytic sites. In many cases, the presence of nontransition metals, that is, s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals with high natural abundance in the earth&#8208;crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline&#8208;earth metals, rare&#8208;earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these nontransition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments toward a knowledge&#8208;based catalyst design. In this review, five classes of nontransition metals species which are successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships and phase stability, are discussed. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field are also addressed in this account. It is anticipated that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals species toward the discovery of advanced polymetal&#8208;containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.

         <title>Macroscale Conjugated Microporous Polymers: Controlling Versatile Functionalities Over Several Dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in macroscale conjugated microporous polymers for gas adsorption, energy, sensing, filtration/purification, and catalysis applications are reviewed, with particular focus on how the macroscopic architectures brings about more functionalities and opportunities.








Abstract
Since discovered in 2007, conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have been developed for numerous applications including gas adsorption, sensing, organic and photoredox catalysis, energy storage, etc. While featuring abundant micropores, the structural rigidity derived from CMPs&#8217; stable &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton leads to insolubility and thus poor processability, which severely limits their applicability, e.g., in CMP&#8208;based devices. Hence, the development of CMPs whose structure can not only be controlled on the micro&#8208; but also on the macroscale have attracted tremendous interest. In conventional synthesis procedures, CMPs are obtained as powders, but in recent years various bottom&#8208;up synthesis strategies have been developed, which yield CMPs as thin films on substrates or as hybrid materials, allowing to span length scales from individual conjugated monomers to micro&#8208;/macrostructures. This review surveys recent advances on the construction of CMPs into macroscale structures, including membranes, films, aerogels, sponges, and other architectures. The focus is to describe the underlying fabrication techniques and the implications which follow from the macroscale morphologies, involving new chemistry and physics in such materials for applications like molecular separation/filtration/adsorption, energy storage and conversion, photothermal transformation, sensing, or catalysis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectrics turns wasted heat energy into useful electrical energy. Current commercial manufacturing techniques are time and energy intensive, contributing to low utilization of thermoelectrics. This review explores how printing has been used to make thermoelectric materials and generators, and how advances in the last five years hold great promise for printing to become the dominant future manufacturing technique for thermoelectrics.








Abstract
The looming impact of climate change and the diminishing supply of fossil fuels both highlight the need for a transition to more sustainable energy sources. While solar and wind can produce much of the energy needed, to meet all our energy demands there is a need for a diverse sustainable energy generation mix. Thermoelectrics can play a vital role in this, by harvesting otherwise wasted heat energy and converting it into useful electrical energy. While efficient thermoelectric materials have been known since the 1950s, thermoelectrics have not been utilized beyond a few niche applications. This can in part be attributed to the high cost of manufacturing and the geometrical restraints of current commercial manufacturing techniques. Printing offers a potential route to manufacture thermoelectric materials at a lower price point and allows for the fabrication of generators that are custom built to meet the waste heat source requirements. This review details the significant progress that has been made in recent years in printing of thermoelectric materials in all thermoelectric material groups and printing methods, and highlights very recent publications that show printing can now offer comparable performance to commercially manufactured thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Topology&#8208;Seeded Graphitization for Highly Thermally Conductive Carbon Fibers</title>

Abstract
Highly thermally conductive carbon fibers (CFs) have become an important material to meet the increasing demand for efficient heat dissipation. To date, the high thermal conductivity has been only achieved in the specific Pitch&#8208;based CFs with high crystallinity. However, obtaining high graphitic crystallinity and high thermal conductivity beyond Pitch&#8208;CFs remains a grand challenge. Here, we present a 2D topology&#8208;seeded graphitization method to mediate the topological incompatibility in graphitization by seeding 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W/mK are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude higher in conductivity than commercial PAN&#8208;based CFs. The self&#8208;oxidation and seeded graphitization effect generate large crystallite size and high orientation to far exceed those of conventional CFs. Topologically seeded graphitization, verified in experiments and simulations, allows converting the non&#8208;graphitizable into graphitizable materials by incorporating 2D seeds. This method extends the preparation of highly thermally conductive CFs, which has great potential for lightweight thermal management materials.

         <title>Designing a redox heterojunction for photocatalytic &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation&#8221; under mild conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ammonia and nitrates are the most fundamental and significant raw ingredients in human society. Till now, industrial synthetic ammonia by Haber&#8722;Bosch process and industrial synthetic nitrates by the Ostwald process have encountered increasingly serious challenges, i.e., high energy consumption, high cost, and environment&#8208;harmful gas emissions. Therefore, developing an alternative approach to achieve nitrogen fixation to overcome the inherent deficiencies of the well&#8208;established Haber&#8208;Bosch and Ostwald processes has fascinated scientists for many years, especially the simultaneous formation of ammonia and nitrate directly from the conversion of N2 molecules, which has been rarely studied. Herein, we design a heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic system to successfully achieve &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation&#8221;, a sustainable and simultaneous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products under mild conditions. In this heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in the CdS and WO3 components. As a result, N2 molecules can be activated and reduced to ammonia products with yields of 35.8&#160;&#956;mol h&#8211;1 g&#8211;1 by a multi&#8208;electron process, and synchronously oxidized into nitrate products with yields of 14.2&#160;&#956;mol h&#8211;1 g&#8211;1 by a hole&#8208;induced oxidation coupling process. This work provides a novel insight and promising approach to realize artificial nitrogen fixation under mild condition.

         <title>Controlled doping of electrocatalysts through engineering impurities</title>

Abstract
Fuel cells recombine water from H2 and O2 thereby powering, e.g., cars or houses with no direct carbon emission. In anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising catalysts. Here, we observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nano&#8208;catalysts synthesised by wet&#8208;chemistry, gain control over this B&#8208;doping, and report on its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. We rationalize our findings using ab&#8208;initio calculations of both H&#8208; and OH&#8208;adsorption on B&#8208;doped Pd. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, we thus design Pt&#8208;free catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, e.g. next generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints, i.e., reasonable operating costs and long&#8208;term stability, to enable the &#8220;hydrogen economy&#8221;.

         <title>Simultaneous One&#8208;pot Interpenetrating Network Formation to Expand 3D Processing Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multi&#8208;step fabrication procedures. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely (i) free&#8208;radical crosslinking of methacrylate&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and (ii) thiol&#8208;ene crosslinking of norbornene&#8208;modified HA with thiolated guest&#8208;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form the secondary network. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8764;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low viscosity digital light processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles. Further, the IPNs are cytocompatible with cell adhesion dependent on the inclusion of adhesive peptides. Overall, the enhanced processing of these IPN hydrogels will expand their utility across applications.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Like Nanogel for Spinning Hierarchically Structured Artificial Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spider dragline silk is drawn spun from soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;crosslinked spidroin in aqueous solution. This spider silk has an excellent combination of strength and toughness, which originates from the hierarchical structure containing &#946;&#8208;sheet crosslinking points, spiral nanoassemblies, a rigid sheath, and a soft core. Inspired by the spidroin structure and spider spinning process, we prepared a soluble and crosslinked nanogel and drew spun crosslinked fibers with spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds in the nanogel solution, and applying pre&#8208;stretch and spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber, further tuned the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhanced the breaking strength (1.27&#160;GPa) and toughness (383&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) to approach those of the best dragline silk. Theoretical modeling provided understanding for the dependence of the fiber's spinning capacity on the nanogel size. This work provides a new strategy for the direct spinning of tough fiber materials.

         <title>Cascade Downregulation of the HER Family by a Dual&#8208;Targeted Recombinant Protein&#8211;Drug Conjugate to Inhibit Tumor Growth and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#160;and integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#160;dual&#8208;targeted recombinant protein drug conjugate can downregulate the expressions of the HER family including EGFR (HER1), HER2, HER3, and HER4, inhibit the downstream signaling pathways, and improve the drug accumulation and distribution in tumors, leading to reduction of tumor size and significant inhibition of tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted therapy can significantly improve the outcome of patients with HER2&#160;positive cancer. However, relapse after this treatment remains a great challenge in the clinic due to tumor resistance, in which the HER network induces constitutive signal transduction. In addition, integrin receptors in the tumor extracellular matrix can mitigate the therapeutic effect of inhibitors to the growth factors receptors and tyrosine kinases. Here, the development of a recombinant protein (RP&#8208;HI) and its drug conjugates (RPDC&#8208;HI) to target both HER2&#160;and integrin is reported. When simultaneously blocking HER2&#160;and integrin by RP&#8208;HI, functions of the HER family and their interactions with the integrin are disrupted by downregulated expressions of HER family members, leading to inhibition of several downstream signal pathways. In combination with targeted delivery of the anticancer agent, doxorubicin (DOX), RPDC&#8208;HI significantly improves the tumor inhibition efficacy to 97.5% in treating HER2&#8208;positive breast cancer, comparing to 34.3% for free DOX. RPDC&#8208;HI shows even better antitumor efficiency than a monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, when treating larger tumors. The developed dual&#8208;targeted RPDC platform offers a new and promising strategy for treating HER2&#8208;positive patients with synergistic therapeutic effects against tumor resistance to the conventional HER2&#8208;targeted treatment.

         <title>Tailoring Ultrafast and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage via a Binding Energy&#8208;Driven Atomic Scissor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Controllably tailoring alloying anode materials to achieve fast charging and enhanced structural stability is crucial for sodium&#8208;ion battery with high rate and high capacity performance, yet remains a significant challenge owing to the huge volume change and sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here a chemical tailoring tool is proposed and developed by atomically dispersing high&#8208;capacity Ge metal into the rigid and conductive sulfide framework for controllable reconstruction of Ge&#8210;S bond to synergistically realize the high capacity and high rate performance for sodium storage. The integrated GeTiS3 material with stable Ti&#8210;S framework and weak Ge&#8210;S bonding delivers high specific capacities of 678 mA&#8901;h g&#8211;1 at 0.3 C over 100 cycles and 209 mA&#8901;h g&#8211;1 at 32 C over 10000 cycles, outperforming most of the reported alloying type anode materials for sodium storage. Interestingly, in situ Raman, XRD and ex situ TEM characterizations reveal the formation of well&#8208;disperse NaxGe confining in the rigid Ti&#8210;S matrix with suppressed volume change after discharge. The synergistically coupled alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution and high reaction reversibility by a binding energy&#8208;driven atomic scissor method would break new ground on designing high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium&#8208;ion battery.

The density of Li metal is low, so the abuse of Li foil in Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) can easily lead to the loss of their advantage in volumetric energy density over Li&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, Li plating on a Li substrate is not as dense as that on a Cu substrate. Therefore, anode&#8208;free LMBs are more worthy of recommendation.








Abstract
Volumetric energy density is a critical but easily neglected index of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Compared with gravimetric energy density, the volumetric energy density (VED) of LMBs is much more sensitive to the anode/cathode (A/C) ratio due to the low density of lithium (Li) metal and the volume expansion of the Li&#8208;metal anode owing to its pulverization during cycles. Anode&#8208;free LMBs (AF&#8208;LMBs) have high theoretical VED due to the absence of an anode and high retention with relatively low cell expansion. Because Li plating highly depends on the mother substrate, Li plating on copper (Cu) substrates is more reversible and denser than that on Li substrates during cycling, which is beneficial for maintaining high volumetric capacity and efficient Li utilization. Therefore, considering that excess Li must be strictly limited to achieve competitive energy density, AF&#8208;LMBs (with bare Cu foil as the anode current collector) for high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;density batteries are recommended.

         <title>A Multitasking Flexible Sensor via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multitasking, flexible sensor sheet for monitoring of weather information via a flexible resistive sensor and reservoir computing is reported. This sensor and reservoir computing combination enables the device to estimate water droplet volume and wind velocity with a small training dataset. An important advance is to realize multiple parameter detection simultaneously using only one flexible sensor.








Abstract
Natural disasters are reported globally, and one source of severe damage to cities is flooding caused by locally heavy rain. Sharing of local weather information can save lives. However, it is difficult to collect local weather information in real&#8208;time because such data collection requires bulky, expensive sensors. For local, real&#8208;time monitoring of heavy rain and wind, a sensor system should be simple and low&#8208;cost so that it can be attached to a variety of surfaces, including roofs, vehicles, and umbrellas. To develop simple, low&#8208;cost multitasking sensors located on nonplanar surfaces, a flexible rain sensor to monitor waterdrop volume and wind velocity is devised. To monitor both simultaneously, a laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based superhydrophobic conductive film is introduced. Using the superhydrophobic surface, water dynamics are measured when waterdrops collide with the sensor surface, and obtained time&#8208;series data are processed using &#8220;reservoir computing&#8221; to extract the volume and velocity from a single sensor as multitasking electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is shown that the sensor measures continuous, long&#8208;term volume and wind&#8208;change dynamics. The results demonstrate feasibility of multitasking electronics with reservoir computing to reduce sensor integration complexity with low power consumption for both sensor and signal processing.

High&#8208;quality gallium nitride (GaN)&#8208;based heterostructures are epitaxially grown on a 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, based on which, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors are fabricated, suggesting a practical approach to realizing GaN/SiC hybrid field&#8208;effect transistors (HyFETs). The distinct two&#8208;step biaxial strain relaxation in the III&#8211;nitride epilayer is revealed, offering a design guideline of such an unconventional vicinal epitaxy technique.








Abstract
A hybrid field&#8208;effect transistor (HyFET), superior for power electronic applications, can be created by harnessing the merits of two representative wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). Yet, the incompactness in the epitaxy techniques hinders the development of the HyFET&#8212;GaN is usually grown on on&#8208;axis foreign substrates including SiC, whereas SiC homoepitaxy prefers off&#8208;axis substrates. This work presents a GaN&#8208;based heterostructure epitaxially grown on a conventional 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;SiC substrate, which manifests its high quality and suitability for constructing GaN&#8208;based high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors, thereby suggesting a practical approach to realizing HyFETs. In the meanwhile, a distinct two&#8208;step biaxial strain&#8208;relaxation process is proposed and studied with comprehensive characterizations.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Stratification of Amyloid Beta Mutants Using Drying Droplet Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted stratification of amyloid beta mutants using drying droplet patterns is reported. A process as simple and scalable as allowing a peptide droplet to dry onto a surface can disclose critical structural mismatches of amyloid beta peptides. When analyzed with pretrained neuronal networks, the peptide deposits predict single amino acid mismatches and conformational misfolding with 99% accuracy.








Abstract
The development of simple and accurate methods to predict mutations in proteins remains an unsolved challenge in modern biochemistry. It is discovered that critical information about primary and secondary peptide structures can be inferred from the stains left behind by their drying droplets. To analyze the complex stain patterns, deep&#8208;learning neuronal networks are challenged with polarized light microscopy images derived from the drying droplet deposits of a range of amyloid beta (1&#8211;42) (A&#946;42) peptides. These peptides differ in a single amino acid residue and represent hereditary mutants of Alzheimer's disease. Stain patterns are not only reproducible but also result in comprehensive stratification of eight amyloid beta (A&#946;) variants with predictive accuracies above 99%. Similarly, peptide stains of a range of distinct A&#946;42 peptide conformations are identified with accuracies above 99%. The results suggest that a method as simple as drying a droplet of a peptide solution onto a solid surface may serve as an indicator of minute, yet structurally meaningful differences in peptides&#8217; primary and secondary structures. Scalable and accurate detection schemes for stratification of conformational and structural protein alterations are critically needed to unravel pathological signatures in many human diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

         <title>2D MBenes: A Novel Member in the Flatland</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D MBenes, early transition metal borides, have recently gained tremendous attention due to their unique properties. This Perspective sheds light on the material&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship of MBenes and elucidates the most prospective applications in various fields, thus opening a promising paradigm for designing new functional systems and high&#8208;performance devices with multipurpose functionalities.








Abstract
2D MBenes, early transition metal borides, are a very recent derivative of ternary or quaternary transition metal boride (MAB) phases and represent a new member in the flatland. Although holding great potential toward various applications, mainly theoretical knowledge about their potential properties is available. Theoretical calculations and preliminary experimental attempts demonstrate their rich chemistry, excellent reactivity, mechanical strength/stability, electrical conductivity, transition properties, and energy harvesting possibility. Compared to MXenes, MBenes&#8217; structure appears to be more complex due to multiple crystallographic arrangements, polymorphism, and structural transformations. This makes their synthesis and subsequent delamination into single flakes challenging. Overcoming this bottleneck will enable a rational control over MBenes&#8217; material&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship. Innovations in MBenes&#8217; postprocessing approaches will allow for the design of new functional systems and devices with multipurpose functionalities thus opening a promising paradigm for the conscious design of high&#8208;performance 2D materials.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials can host long&#8208;range magnetic order in the presence of underlying magnetic anisotropy. The ability to realize the full potential of 2D magnets necessitates systematic investigation of the role of individual atomic layers and nanoscale inhomogeneity (i.e., strain) on the emergence of stable magnetic phases. Here, spatial&#8208;dependent magnetism in few&#8208;layer CrSBr is revealed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Monte Carlo&#8208;based simulations. Nanoscale visualization of the magnetic sheet susceptibility is extracted from MFM data and force&#8208;distance curves, revealing a characteristic onset of both intra&#8208; and interlayer magnetic correlations as a function of temperature and layer&#8208;thickness. These results demonstrate that the presence of a single uncompensated layer in odd&#8208;layer terraces significantly reduces the stability of the low&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and gives rise to multiple coexisting magnetic ground states at temperatures close to the bulk N&#233;el temperature (TN). Furthermore, the AFM phase can be reliably suppressed using modest fields (&#8764;30 mT) from the MFM probe, behaving as a nanoscale magnetic switch. This prototypical study of few&#8208;layer CrSBr demonstrates the critical role of layer parity on field&#8208;tunable 2D magnetism and validates MFM for use in nano&#8208;magnetometry of 2D materials (despite the ubiquitous absence of bulk zero&#8208;field magnetism in magnetized sheets).

         <title>Promoting ex&#8208;solution from metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;mediated oxide scaffold for highly active and robust catalysts</title>

Abstract
Ex&#8208;solution catalysts, in which a host oxide is decorated with confined metallic nanoparticles, have exhibited breakthrough activity in various catalytic reactions. However, catalysts prepared by conventional ex&#8208;solution processes are limited by the low surface area of host oxides, the limited solubility of dopants, and the incomplete conversion of doped cations into metal catalysts. In this contribution, we reconceptualized the design of the host oxide structure using a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor that can absorb a large quantity of ions while also promoting ex&#8208;solution at low temperatures (400&#8211;500&#176;C). The MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide host can readily incorporate metal cations, from which catalytic nanoparticles can be uniformly ex&#8208;solved owing to the short diffusion length in the nano&#8208;sized oxides. We investigated the distinct ex&#8208;solution behaviors of Pt, Pd and Rh, and their bimetallic combinations. The MOF&#8208;driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex&#8208;solved at 500&#176;C showed benchmark&#8208;level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Our findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex&#8208;solution process rationally.

         <title>Unravelling the Nature of the Intrinsic Complex Structure of Binary Phase Na&#8208;layered Oxides</title>

Abstract
The layered sodium transition metal oxide, NaTMO2 (TM; transition metal), with a binary or ternary phases has displayed the outstanding electrochemical performances as a new class of strategy cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Despite their demonstrated ability and advantages, however, a precise and comprehensive understanding of the underlying structure accounting for their intrinsic structural stability during cycling is still lacking even as the mixed&#8208;phase compounds exhibit their inherent structural complexity compared with their single&#8208;phase counterparts. Herein, we offer an in&#8208;depth phase analysis of our developed Na1&#8208;xTMO2 cathode materials, Na0.76Ni0.20Fe0.40Mn0.40O2 with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3). We also provide structural visualization on an atomic scale and unveil the following findings: (i) the existence of a mixed&#8208;phase intergrowth layer distribution and unequal distribution of P2 and O3 phases along two different crystal plane indices; and, (ii) a complete reversible charge/discharge process for the initial two cycles that displays a simple phase transformation that is unprecedented. Moreover, first&#8208;principles calculations method supported evidence of the formation of a binary NFMO&#8208;P2/O3 compound, over the proposed hypothetical monophasic structures (O3, P3, O&#697;3, and P2 phases). As a result, the synergetic effect of the simultaneous existence of P&#8208; and O&#8208;type phases with their unique structures allow an extraordinary level of capacity retention in a wide range of voltage (1.5&#8211;4.5 V). We believe that the insightful understanding of our proposed materials can introduce new perspectives for the development of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>Water&#8208;triggered stiffening of shape memory polyurethanes composed of hard backbone dangling PEG soft segments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) induced by heat or water are commonly used candidates for biomedical applications. Shape recovery inevitably leads to a dramatic decrease of Youngs modulus due to the enhanced flexibility of polymer chains at the transition temperature. Herein, we introduced the principle of phase transition&#8208;induced stiffening of shape memory metallic alloys (SMAs) to the design of molecular structures for shape memory polyurethane (SMPUs), featuring all hard segments composed main chains that are attached with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dangling side chains. Different from conventional SMPs, they achieved a soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff transition when shape recovered. The stiffening process was driven by water&#8208;triggered segmental rearrangement due to the incompatibility between the hard segments and soft PEG segments. Upon hydration, the extent of microphase separation was enhanced and the hard domains were transformed to a more continuous morphology to realize more effective stress transfer. Meanwhile, such segmental rearrangement facilitated the shape recovery process in hydrated state despite the final increased glass transition temperature(Tg). Our work represents a novel paradigm of simultaneously integrating balanced mechanics, shape memory property and biocompatibility for SMPUs as materials for minimally invasive surgery such as endoluminal stents.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics with Optimized Light Utilization for Printable Solar Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction strategy is an efficient strategy to improving average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) simultaneously due to the reduction of the optical loss, and the semitransparent devices afford a highest efficiency of 14.62% with a considerable AVT of 20.42%.








Abstract
The existing conformation of the active layer is defective for employment of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) in solar windows. Herein, scalable solar windows are successfully printed by introducing a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) structure. The PPHJ structure can effectively improve the average visible transmittance (AVT) value while boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of semitransparent devices due to the reduced optical loss. The universality of the PPHJ structure in the preparation of ST&#8208;OSCs is proved. Furthermore, an inset of a superhydrophobic patterned soft insertion layer (PSIL) in the encapsulated window improves the waterproof performance without losing transparency. Accordingly, the semitransparent devices based on the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((2Z,2&#8242;Z)&#8208;((12,13&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;3,9&#8208;diundecyl&#8208;12,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;e]thieno[2&#8243;,3&#8243;:4&#8242;,5&#8242;]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;g]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;2,10&#8208;diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) system afford a maximal efficiency of 14.62%, with a considerable AVT of 20.42%, and the resultant solar windows achieve a stabilized efficiency of 13.34% with excellent waterproof performance.

         <title>Cellulose Nanocrystal Aqueous Colloidal Suspensions: Evidence of Density Inversion at the Isotropic&#8208;liquid Crystal Phase Transition</title>

Abstract
The colloidal suspensions of aqueous cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are known to form liquid crystalline systems above certain critical concentrations. From an isotropic phase; tactoid formation; growth; and sedimentation have been determined as the genesis of a high&#8208;density cholesteric phase; which after drying; originates solid iridescent films. Herein; we report the coexistence of a liquid crystal upper phase and an isotropic bottom phase in CNC aqueous suspensions at isotropic&#8208;nematic phase separation for the first time. Furthermore; isotropic spindle&#8208;like domains are observed in the low&#8208;density liquid crystalline phase; and high&#8208;density liquid crystalline phases are also prepared. The CNCs isolated from the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density liquid crystalline phases are found to have similar average lengths; diameters; and surface charges. The existence of a liquid crystalline low&#8208;density phase is explained by the presence of air dissolved in the water present within the CNCs. The air dissolves out when the water solidifies into ice and remains within the CNCs. The self&#8208;adjustment of the cellulose chain conformation enables the entrapment of air within the CNCs and CNC buoyancy in aqueous suspensions.

A facile and universal concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solution discharge in aprotic Li&#8211;O2 batteries is proposed, and 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ), an antioxidant with hydroxyl groups, is introduced as an exemplary soluble catalyst to promote the solution discharge by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation of O2&#8722; and Li2O2 (O&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O); thus, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with DBHQ delivers an ultrahigh discharge capacity and Li2O2 yield.








Abstract
Surface discharge mechanism induced cathode passivation is a critical challenge that blocks the full liberation of the ultrahigh theoretical energy density in aprotic Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Herein, a facile and universal concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation is proposed to trigger the solution discharge process for averting the shortcomings associated with surface discharge. 2,5&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ), an antioxidant with hydroxyl groups, is introduced as an exemplary soluble catalyst to promote solution discharge by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation of O2&#8722; and Li2O2 (O&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O). Thus, a Li&#8211;O2 battery with 50&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m DBHQ delivers an extraordinary discharge capacity of 18&#160;945 mAh g&#8722;1 (i.e., 9.47 mAh cm&#8722;2), even surpassing the capacity endowed by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reduction mediator of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone. Besides, an ultrahigh Li2O2 yield of 97.1% is also achieved due to the depressed reactivity of the reduced oxygen&#8208;containing species (O2&#8722;, LiO2, and Li2O2) by the solvating and antioxidative abilities of DBHQ. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with DBHQ exhibits excellent cycling lifetime and rate capability. Furthermore, the generalizability of this approach of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solution discharge is verified by other soluble catalysts that contain &#63743;OH or &#63743;NH groups, with implications that could bring Li&#8211;O2 batteries one step closer to being a viable technology.

         <title>Crowning Lithium Ions in Hole&#8208;Transport Layer toward Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed LiTFSI doping in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to address the negative impacts of doping&#8208;induced hygroscopicity and ion diffusion. Crowning Li+ ions in the hole&#8208;transporting layer enables perovskite solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency and significantly improves stability under humid and thermal conditions.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to that of silicon photovoltaic devices. However, the device stability remains a major obstacle that restricts widespread application. Doping&#8208;induced hygroscopicity, ion diffusion, and use of polar solvents in the hole&#8208;transport layer are detrimental factors for performance degradation of PSCs. Here, phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed LiTFSI doping in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to address these negative impacts. 12&#8208;Crown&#8208;4&#160;as an efficient phase&#8208;transfer catalyst promotes the dissolution of LiTFSI without requiring acetonitrile. A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates the host&#8211;guest interaction between Li+ ions and 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Crowning Li+ ions by forming more stable and less diffusive crown&#8208;ether&#8211;Li+ complexes retards the generation of hygroscopic lithium oxides and mitigates Li+&#8208;ion migration. Optimized PSCs deliver enhanced PCE and significantly improved stability under humid and thermal conditions compared with a control device. This method can also be applied to dope &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer. The findings provide a facile avenue to improve the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs.

         <title>An On&#8208;Chip Liquid Metal Plug Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator is demonstrated. Reproducible liquid metal plugs of a given size are generated based on Laplace pressure tuning in constricted channels whereas plugs of varying sizes and interspacing are generated for modulated voltages in straight channels prefilled with 1 m NaOH. This device can be used to generate liquid metal plugs on demand directly on&#8208;chip.








Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal nonspherical droplets (plugs) have seen increasing demand recently mainly because their high aspect ratios make them beneficial for a wide range of applications, including microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidics, sensor technology, radio&#8208;frequency devices, actuators, and switches. However, reproducibility of the generation of such plugs, as well as precise control over their size, is yet challenging. In this work, a simple on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator using a commercially available 3D microprinter is presented and the plug generator in poly(dimethylsiloxane) is replicated via soft lithography. Liquid metal plugs are generated via a combination of electrochemical oxidation, design of well&#8208;defined constrictions based on Laplace pressure, and the application of modulated voltage control signals. It is shown that plugs of various aspect ratios can be generated reproducibly for channel widths of 0.5, 0.8, and 1.5&#160;mm with constriction widths of 0.1&#160;mm at 6&#160;V. Laplace&#8208;pressure&#8208;controlled plugs in constricted channels are compared to modulated&#8208;voltage&#8208;generated plugs in straight channels showing that this technique provides significantly enhanced reproducibility and control over the size and spacing between the plugs. This work paves the way to sub&#8208;millimeter liquid metal plugs generated directly on&#8208;chip for on&#8208;demand MEMS and microfluidic applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral domain walls are moved with current pulses highly efficiently along synthetic antiferromagnetic racetracks formed on thin underlayers of several 5d&#8208;Al alloys. These alloys exhibit very large spin Hall angles of up to &#8776;1.0 and, moreover, template [001] oriented Co&#8211;Ni multilayers with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, making them highly useful for racetrack memories compatible with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technologies.








Abstract
The generation of spin currents from charge currents via the spin Hall effect (SHE) is of fundamental and technological interest. Here, some of the largest SHEs yet observed via extrinsic scattering are found in a large class of binary compounds formed from a 5d element and aluminum, with a giant spin Hall angle (SHA) of &#8776;1 in the compound Os22Al78. A critical composition of the 5d element is found at which there is a structural phase boundary between poorly and highly textured crystalline material, where the SHA exhibits its largest value. Furthermore, a systematic increase is found in the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and SHA at this critical composition as the atomic number of the 5d element is systematically increased. This clearly shows that the SHE and SHC are derived from extrinsic scattering mechanisms related to the potential mismatch between the 5d element and Al. These studies show the importance of extrinsic mechanisms derived from potential mismatch as a route to obtaining large spin Hall angles with high technological impact. Indeed, it is demonstrated that a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art racetrack device has a several&#8208;fold increased current&#8208;induced domain wall efficiency using these materials as compared to prior&#8208;art materials.

Abstract
With the reduction of feature size and increase of integration density, the traditional three&#8208;dimensional (3D) semiconductors have been unable to meet the future requirements of chip integration. The current semiconductor fabrication technologies are approaching their physical limits based on the Moore's law. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), etc., are of great promise for future memory, logic, and photonic devices due to their unique and excellent properties. To prompt the 2D materials and devices from laboratory research stage to industrial integrated circuit&#8208;level, it is necessary to develop advanced nanopatterning methods to obtain high&#8208;quality, wafer&#8208;scale and patterned 2D products. In this article, we review the recent development of nanopatterning technologies, particularly towards realizing the large&#8208;scale practical application of 2D materials. Based on the technological progress, we further summarize the unique requirement and advances of the 2D integration process for logic, memory and optoelectronic devices. Finally, we prospect the opportunities and challenges of the nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials for future integrated chip devices.

         <title>Stretchable Redox&#8208;Active Semiconducting Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymer with stretchability up to 200% strain and 5000 repeated cycles is reported. The strain&#8208;induced electrical performance and structural evolution are systematically studied. An intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is fabricated to give the a normalized Gm of 233 S cm&#8722;1 and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Real&#8208;time on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram signal recording is realized.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent an emerging device platform for next&#8208;generation bioelectronics owing to the uniquely high amplification and sensitivity to biological signals. For achieving seamless tissue&#8211;electronics interfaces for accurate signal acquisition, skin&#8208;like softness and stretchability are essential requirements, but they have not yet been imparted onto high&#8208;performance OECTs, largely due to the lack of stretchable redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymers. Here, a stretchable semiconductor is reported for OECT devices, namely poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5)yl thiophene) (p(g2T&#8208;T)), which gives exceptional stretchability over 200% strain and 5000 repeated stretching cycles, together with OECT performance on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Validated by systematic characterizations and comparisons of different polymers, the key design features of this polymer that enable the combination of high stretchability and high OECT performance are a nonlinear backbone architecture, a moderate side&#8208;chain density, and a sufficiently high molecular weight. Using this highly stretchable polymer semiconductor, an intrinsically stretchable OECT is fabricated with high normalized transconductance (&#8776;223 S cm&#8722;1) and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Furthermore, on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram (ECG) recording is demonstrated, which combines built&#8208;in amplification and unprecedented skin conformability.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Integrated Soft Thermoelectrics for Shape Memory Actuation and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) thermoelectric device is reported, which combining active Peltier heating and cooling of LCE, along with environmental and regenerative Seebeck energy harvesting in a 3D printed material architecture. A new method of actuating LCEs, along with a new, more efficient approach to soft robotics, is introduced.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have attracted tremendous interest as actuators for soft robotics due to their mechanical and shape memory properties. However, LCE actuators typically respond to thermal stimulation through active Joule heating and passive cooling, which make them difficult to control. In this work, LCEs are combined with soft, stretchable thermoelectrics to create transducers capable of electrically controlled actuation, active cooling, and thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion. The thermoelectric layers are composed of semiconductors embedded within a 3D printed elastomer matrix and wired together with eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn) liquid metal interconnects. This layer is covered on both sides with LCE, which alternately heats and cools to achieve cyclical bending actuation in response to voltage&#8208;controlled Peltier activation. Moreover, the thermoelectric layer can harvest energy from thermal gradients between the two LCE layers through the Seebeck effect, allowing for regenerative energy harvesting. As demonstrations, first, closed&#8208;loop control of the transducer is performed to rapidly track a changing actuator position. Second, a soft robotic walker that is capable of walking toward a heat source and harvesting energy is introduced. Lastly, phototropic&#8208;inspired autonomous deflection of the limbs toward a heat source is shown, demonstrating an additional method to increase energy recuperation efficiency for soft systems.

         <title>Porous Polymers as Universal Reversal Agents for Heparin Anticoagulants through an Inclusion&#8211;Sequestration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inclusion&#8211;sequestration strategy is developed by making use of multicationic supramolecular organic frameworks and porous organic polymers as porous antidotes to neutralize heparins. In vitro and in vivo experiments and biocompatibility evaluations confirm that the porous polymers can realize rapid, safe, and universal reversal of heparin&#8208;based anticoagulants, superior to that of clinically used protamine.








Abstract
Heparins are widely used anticoagulants for surgical procedures and extracorporeal therapies. However, all of them have bleeding risks. Protamine sulfate, the only clinically approved antidote for unfractionated heparin (UFH), has adverse effects. Moreover, protamine can only partially neutralize low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight heparins (LMWHs) and is not effective for fondaparinux. Here, an inclusion&#8211;sequestration strategy for efficient neutralization of heparin anticoagulants by cationic porous supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs) is reported. Isothermal titration calorimetric and fluorescence experiments show strong binding affinities of these porous polymers toward heparins, whereas dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analysis confirm that the heparin sequences are adsorbed into the interior of the porous hosts. Activated partial thromboplastin time, anti&#8208;FXa, and thromboelastography assays indicate that their neutralization efficacies are higher than or as high as that of protamine for UFH and generally superior to protamine for LMWHs and fondaparinux, which is further confirmed by tail&#8208;transection model in mice and ex vivo aPTT or anti&#8208;FXa analysis in rats. Acute toxicity evaluations reveal that one of the SOFs displays outstanding biocompatibility. This work suggests that porous polymers can supply safe and rapid reversal of clinically used heparins, as protamine surrogates, providing an improved approach for their neutralization.

         <title>A Universal Strategy of Intermolecular Exchange to Stabilize &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 and Manage Crystal Orientation for High&#8208;Performance Humid&#8208;Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Long&#8208;chain n&#8208;heptylamine is introduced via antisolvent engineering into a formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite film, which promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis and superior stability.








Abstract
Preparation of high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells without strict environmental control is an inevitable trend of commercialization. Humidity is considered the main factor hindering perovskite performance. Formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskites suffer from the instability of photoactive black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, especially in humid air, and numerous defects in the surface and bulk of perovskite films limit their performance. In this work, long&#8208;chain n&#8208;heptylamine (nHA) is introduced via antisolvent engineering into an FA&#8208;based perovskite film. nHA removes the negative intermediate adduct and promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. Moreover, the existence of nHA in the final perovskite film also reduces the defects and suppresses ion migration. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis, and the fabricated devices exhibit superior reproductivity. The device stability is also enhanced, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE after 1500 h in ambient air. Moreover, the PCE has no attenuation at the maximum power point under continuous 1&#8208;sun light soaking for 500 h. The universality of this method is also demonstrated by other perovskite compositions, including methylamine lead iodine (MAPbI3) and FAxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 in humid air.

         <title>Polyiodide Confinement by Starch Enables Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the significant chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, the shuttle effect of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries is effectively addressed by using starch, which strongly anchors polyiodide anions due to its unique double&#8208;helix structure. Benefiting from this structure confinement, a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% and an ultralong life of 50&#160;000 cycles are realized in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries have been regarded as a promising energy&#8208;storage system owing to their high energy/power density, safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the polyiodide shuttling results in serious active mass loss and Zn corrosion, which limits the cycling life of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. Inspired by the chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, a structure confinement strategy is proposed to suppress polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries by hiring starch, due to its unique double&#8208;helix structure. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates an I5&#8722;&#8208;dominated I&#8722;/I2 conversion mechanism when using starch. The I5&#8722; presents a much stronger bonding with starch than I3&#8722;, inhibiting the polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries, which is confirmed by in situ ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectra. Consequently, a highly reversible Zn&#8211;I2 battery with high Coulombic efficiency (&#8776;100% at 0.2 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling stability (&gt;50&#160;000 cycles) is realized. Simultaneously, the Zn corrosion triggered by polyiodide is effectively inhibited owing to the desirable shuttling&#8208;suppression by the starch, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. This work provides a new understanding of the failure mechanism of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries and proposes a cheap but effective strategy to realize high&#8208;cyclability Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Acid&#8208;in&#8208;Clay Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range and Long&#8208;Cycle Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte is prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, ranking top among the solid proton conductors in terms of high proton conductivities, enlarged electrochemical stability window, and reduced chemical reactivity. Benefitting from the above advantages, the acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte can solve two main challenges in proton batteries: gassing and poor cycling performance.








Abstract
Proton conduction underlies many important electrochemical technologies. A family of new proton electrolytes is reported: acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte (AiCE) prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, which can be made into thin&#8208;film (tens of micrometers) fluid&#8208;impervious membranes. The chosen example systems (sepiolite&#8211;phosphoric acid) rank top among the solid proton conductors in terms of proton conductivities (15 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, 0.023 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;82&#160;&#176;C), electrochemical stability window (3.35&#160;V), and reduced chemical reactivity. A proton battery is assembled using AiCE as the solid electrolyte membrane. Benefitting from the wider electrochemical stability window, reduced corrosivity, and excellent ionic selectivity of AiCE, the two main problems (gassing and cyclability) of proton batteries are successfully solved. This work draws attention to the element cross&#8208;over problem in proton batteries and the generic &#8220;acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay&#8221; solid electrolyte approach with superfast proton transport, outstanding selectivity, and improved stability for room&#8208; to cryogenic&#8208;temperature protonic applications.

         <title>A Robust Memristor Based on Epitaxial Vertically Aligned Nanostructured BaTiO3&#8722;CeO2 Films on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite films system consisting of ferroelectric material and dielectric film is proposed as a memristor medium to improve the comprehensive performances of the resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and epitaxial BaTiO3&#8722;CeO2 ferroelectric films on silicon are obtained successfully. The durability of the device is more than 109 cycles, and the speed can be lower than 10 ns.








Abstract
With the exploration of ferroelectric materials, researchers have a strong desire to explore the next generation of non&#8208;volatile ferroelectric memory with silicon&#8208;based epitaxy, high&#8208;density storage, and algebraic operations. Herein, a silicon&#8208;based memristor with an epitaxial vertically aligned nanostructures BaTiO3&#8211;CeO2 film based on La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/SrTiO3/Si substrate is reported. The ferroelectric polarization reversal is optimized through the continuous exploring of growth temperature, and the epitaxial structure is obtained, thus it improves the resistance characteristic, the multi&#8208;value storage function of five states is achieved, and the robust endurance characteristic can reach 109 cycles. In the synapse plasticity modulated by pulse voltage process, the function of the spiking&#8208;time&#8208;dependent plasticity and paired&#8208;pulse facilitation is simulated successfully. More importantly, the algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are realized by using fast speed pulse of the width &#8776;50&#160;ns. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network is constructed for identifying the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset, to simulate the performance of the device; the online and offline learning recognition rate reach 90.03% and 92.55%, respectively. Overall, this study paves the way for memristors with silicon&#8208;based epitaxial ferroelectric films to realize multi&#8208;value storage, algebraic operations, and neural computing chip applications.

Overall, this study paves the way for memristors with silicon-based epitaxial ferroelectric films to realize multi-value storage, algebraic operations, and neural computing chip applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Dendrimers that Underpin High&#8208;Efficiency Host&#8208;Free Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a donor&#8211;acceptor dendrimer emitter that shows remarkable photophysical properties, including efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and high photoluminescence quantum yield, is reported. Its use is demonstrated in a host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) that shows record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenge. An effective solution, highlighted in this work, is to use highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimers as emitters. Here, the design, synthesis, density functional theory (DFT) modeling, and photophysics of three triazine&#8208;based dendrimers, tBuCz2pTRZ, tBuCz2mTRZ, and tBuCz2m2pTRZ, is reported, which resolve the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small &#916;EST and a large oscillator strength by incorporating both meta&#8208; and para&#8208;connected donor dendrons about a central triazine acceptor. The solution&#8208;processed OLED containing a host&#8208;free emitting layer exhibits an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 28.7%, a current efficiency of 98.8&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and a power efficiency of 91.3&#160;lm W&#8722;1. The device emits with an electroluminescence maximum, &#955;EL, of 540&#160;nm and Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) color coordinates of (0.37, 0.57). This represents the most efficient host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed OLED reported to date. Further optimization directed at improving the charge balance within the device results in an emissive layer containing 30 wt% OXD&#8208;7, which leads to an OLED with the similar EQEmax of 28.4% but showing a significantly improved efficiency rolloff where the EQE remains high at 22.7% at a luminance of 500&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Facile, Energy&#8208;Efficient Microscale Fibrillation of Polyacrylamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into fiber formation can provide rationale for the design of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. An energy&#8208;efficient route to formation of fibers with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is reported. This strategy offers a molecular&#8208;level understanding of fiber formation under ambient conditions which reduces current required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Insight into fiber formation can provide new rationale for the design and preparation of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. While synthetic bioinspired fibers have shown impressive tensile properties, the fiber formation process remains poorly understood. Moreover, these systems are highly complex and their formation is environmentally and economically costly. Controlled fiber formation under ambient conditions from polyacrylamide solutions with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is demonstrated. Photopolymerization and subsequent microscale fibrillation of different acrylamides in water/ethanol mixtures yield a simple and energy&#8208;efficient route to fiber formation. This strategy reduces required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude. Through extensive experimental elucidation, insight into precise fiber forming conditions of polymeric solutions is achieved. Ethanol is utilized as a chain transfer agent to control the molecular weight of the polyacrylamides, and the entanglement regimes of the solutions are determined through rheological characterization showing fiber formation above the entanglement concentration. Unique from previously reported hydrogel microfibers, it is shown that fibers with good mechanical properties can be obtained without the need for composites or crosslinkers. The reported approach offers a platform for fiber formation under ambient conditions with molecular&#8208;level understanding of their&#160;assembly.

         <title>Quantum Sensing and Imaging of Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque&#8208;Driven Spin Dynamics in the Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet Mn3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum imaging of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films is achieved using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also established, highlighting the significant potential of NV centers in diagnosing the local magnetic properties of emergent quantum materials with vanishingly small magnetic moments.








Abstract
Novel non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets with spontaneous time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking, non&#8208;trivial band topology, and unconventional transport properties have received immense research interest over the past decade due to their rich physics and enormous promise in technological applications. One of the central focuses in this emerging field is exploring the relationship between the microscopic magnetic structure and exotic material properties. Here, nanoscale imaging of both spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;induced deterministic magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers are reported. Direct evidence of the off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between the spin dynamics in Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also demonstrated by NV relaxometry measurements. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of NV centers in accessing the local information of the magnetic order and dynamics in these emergent quantum materials and suggest new opportunities for investigating the interplay between topology and magnetism in a broad range of topological magnets.

         <title>Foldable Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Electrolyte Mediation in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolyte by engineering of the molecular channels in lithiated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is presented. In situ electrolyte mediation in the COF increases charge&#8208;carrier concentration, eliminates interfacial defects, and activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner. The COF&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates reliable electrochemical cyclability in pouch cells.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high Li+ conductivity, flexibility, durability, and stability offer an attractive solution to enhance safety and energy density. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses challenges to the existing solid polymeric or ceramic electrolytes. Here, an electrolyte&#8208;mediated single&#8208;Li+&#8208;conductive covalent organic framework (COF) is presented, which represents a new category of quality solid&#8208;state Li+ conductors. In situ solidification of a tailored liquid electrolyte boosts the charge&#8208;carrier concentration in the COF channels, decouples Li+ cations from both COF walls and molecular chains, and eliminates defects by crystal soldering. Such an altered microenvironment activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner, which leads to an increase in Li+ conductivity by 100 times with a transference number of 0.85 achieved at room temperature. Moreover, the electrolyte conversion cements the ultrathin COF membrane with fortified mechanical toughness. With the COF membrane, foldable solid&#8208;state pouch cells are demonstrated.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive negative phototransistors are developed based on 1D/2D molecular crystal (1D/2DMC) p&#8211;n heterojunctions. This unique structure utilizes photogenerated holes of p&#8208;type 1DMCs to dope electron carriers in n&#8208;type 2DMC channels under UV illumination, achieving complete depletion of the channel current. The negative phototransistor exhibits superior performance parameters, accurately controllable threshold voltage by light, and ultrasensitive detection of weak light.








Abstract
Anomalous negative phototransistors in which the channel current decreases under light illumination hold potential to generate novel and multifunctional optoelectronic applications. Although a variety of design strategies have been developed to construct such devices, NPTs still suffer from far lower device performance compared to well&#8208;developed positive phototransistors (PPTs). In this work, a novel 1D/2D molecular crystal p&#8211;n heterojunction, in which p&#8208;type 1D molecular crystal (1DMC) arrays are embedded into n&#8208;type 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs), is developed to produce ultrasensitive NPTs. The p&#8208;type 1DMC arrays act as light&#8208;absorbing layers to induce p&#8208;doping of n&#8208;type 2DMCs through charge transfer under illumination, resulting in ineffective gate control and significant negative photoresponses. As a result, the NPTs show remarkable performances in photoresponsivity (P) (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;108) and detectivity (D*) (1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones), greatly outperforming previously reported NPTs, which are one of the highest values among all organic phototransistors. Moreover, the device exhibits intriguing characteristics undiscovered in PPTs, including precise control of the threshold voltage by controlling light signals and ultrasensitive detection of weak light. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NTPs are demonstrated as light encoders that can encrypt electrical signals by light. These findings represent a milestone for negative phototransistors, and pave the way for the development of future novel optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Photoexcitation Dynamics and Long&#8208;Lived Excitons in Strain&#8208;Engineered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient absorption in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides grown on fused silica by the laser&#8208;assisted synthesis technique exhibits very unusual decay dynamics that feature long&#8208;lived components progressively increasing with the excitation fluence. The experimental observations are interpreted as resulting from the strain&#8208;induced modification of the electronic bands and concomitant interplay of the intervalley and intravalley excitons&#8217; populations.








Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors has garnered intense research interest in tailoring the optical properties via strain&#8208;induced modifications of the electronic bands in TMDs, while its impact on the exciton dynamics remains less understood. To address this, an extensive study of transient optical absorption (TA) of both W&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based single&#8208;crystalline monolayer TMDs grown by a recently developed laser&#8208;assisted evaporation method is performed. All spectral features of the monolayers as grown on fused silica substrates exhibit appreciable redshifts relating to the existence of strain due to growth conditions. Moreover, these systems exhibit a dramatic slowing down of exciton dynamics (100s of picoseconds to few nanoseconds) with an increase in carrier densities, which strongly contrasts with the monolayers in their freestanding form as well as in comparison with more traditionally grown TMDs. The observations are related to the modifications of the electronic bands as expected from the strain and associated population of the intervalley dark excitons that can now interplay with intravalley excitations. These findings are consistent across both the Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based TMD families, providing key information about the influence of the growth conditions on the nature of optical excitations and fostering emerging optoelectronic applications of monolayer TMDs.

         <title>Intracellular self&#8208;assembly driven uninterrupted ROS generator augments 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid&#8208;based tumor therapy</title>

Abstract
Free radical therapy based on 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer PpIX) has been approved by the US FDA for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photo&#8208;inactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), we developed an uninterrupted ROS generator (URG) that converted useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly. The URG was prepared by enwrapping ALA&#8208;loaded polyamide&#8208;amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;structured AS1411. URGs realized &#8220;1O2&#8208;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted generation through &#8220;recycling waste&#8221; in two steps: i) PpIX generated 1O2 under laser irradiation; ii) the photo&#8208;inactive metabolite heme self&#8208;assembled with AS1411 to catalyze H2O2 conversion into &#8226;OH. Interestingly, the specific generation of 1O2 in mitochondria and &#8226;OH in nuclei further augmented the free radical&#8208;induced damage. We demonstrated that URG could continuously produce free radicals for 6 h post&#8208;irradiation, and showed 3.3&#8208;times more than that of non&#8208;assembly group, achieving nearly 80% regression of tumors in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;Free radical therapy based on 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer PpIX) has been approved by the US FDA for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photo-inactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA-PpIX-heme), we developed an uninterrupted ROS generator (URG) that converted useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self-assembly. The URG was prepared by enwrapping ALA-loaded polyamide-amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G-quadruplex-structured AS1411.

         <title>A Gapped Phase in Semimetallic Td&#8208;WTe2 Induced by Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Weyl semimetal WTe2 has shown several correlated electronic behaviors, such as the quantum spin Hall effect, superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and a possible exciton insulator state, all of which can be tuned by various physical and chemical approaches. Here, we discover a new electronic phase in WTe2 induced by lithium intercalation. The new phase exhibits an increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature and its carrier density is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the carrier density of the semi&#8208;metallic Td phase, probed by in situ Hall measurements as a function of lithium intercalation. Our theoretical calculations predict the new lithiated phase to be a potential charge density wave (CDW) phase with a bandgap of &#8764; 0.14&#160;eV, in good agreement with the in situ transport data. The new phase is structurally distinct from the initial Td phase, characterized by polarization angle&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy, and large lattice distortions close to 6% are predicted in the new phase. Our finding of a new gapped phase in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semi&#8208;metal demonstrates electrochemical intercalation as a powerful tuning knob for modulating electron density and phase stability in 2D materials.

         <title>Engineering DNA&#8208;Guided Hydroxyapatite Bulk Materials with High Stiffness and Outstanding Antimicrobial Ability for Dental Inlay Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Programmable base pair interactions at the nanoscale make DNA an attractive scaffold for forming hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanostructures. However, engineering macroscale HAP mineralization guided by DNA molecules remains challenging. To overcome this issue, we developed a facile strategy for the fabrication of ultra&#8208;stiff DNA&#8211;HAP bulk composites. The electrostatic complexation of DNA and a surfactant with a quaternary ammonium salt group enabled the formation of long&#8208;range ordered scaffolds using electrospinning. The growth of one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional HAP minerals were thus realized by this DNA template at a macroscale. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared DNA&#8211;HAP composites exhibited an ultra&#8208;high Young's modulus of approximately 25&#160;GPa, which is comparable to natural HAP and superior to most artificial mineralized composites. Furthermore, a new type of dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial properties was developed using the stiff DNA&#8211;HAP. The encapsulated quaternary ammonium group within the dense HAP endowed the composite with long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial activity. Therefore, this new type of super&#8208;stiff biomaterial holds great potential for oral prosthetic applications.

         <title>Boosting H2 Production from BiVO4 Photoelectrochemical Biomass Fuel Cell by the Construction of a Bridge for Charge and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Utilizing photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile organic wastes oxidation has been regarded as an effective method to improve the H2 production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels can't be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO4 PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO4, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H2. Remarkably, under AM 1.5 G illumination, the optimal nano&#8208;porous BiVO4 photoanode exhibits the high current density of 13.54&#160;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H2 production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H2 production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly 3&#8208;D Penetrating Nanonetwork for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of wearable technology can significantly benefit from electronic displays fabricated using intrinsically stretchable (is&#8208;) materials. Typically, an improvement in the stretchability of conventional light&#8208;emitting polymers is accompanied by a decrease in charge transportability, thus resulting in a significant decrease in device efficiency. In this study, we developed a self&#8208;assembly 3&#8208;D penetrating nanonetwork to achieve increased stretchability and mobility simultaneously, based on the polymers high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The mobility of L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN increased by 5&#8211;6 times and the stretchability increased from 20% (pristine L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV film) to 100%. We observed a high current efficiency (CE) of 8.13&#160;cd A&#8208;1 in polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated using 40% stretched L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN. Furthermore, using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) based is&#8208; electron injection layer of Zn&#8208;PEIE&#8208;pBphen&#8208;TR, we realized an is&#8208;PLED with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 6.5&#160;V and a high CE of 2.35&#160;cd A&#8208;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using self&#8208;assembly 3&#8208;D penetrating nanonetwork for the fabrication of is&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>Prediction and Design of Nanozymes Using Explainable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It was identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme&#8208;like activity. Here we demonstrated a data&#8208;driven approach that utilized machine learning algorithms to understand particle&#8208;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. High consistency between predicted outputs and the observations was confirmed by accuracy (90.6%) and R2 (up to 0.80). Furthermore, sensitive analysis of the models revealed the central roles of transition metals in determining nanozyme activity. As an example, the models were successfully applied to predict or design desirable nanozymes by uncovering the hidden relationship between different periods of transition metals and their enzyme&#8208;like performance. This study offers a promising strategy to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity and demonstrates the potential of machine learning within the field of material science.

         <title>An Ultrafast, Durable, and High&#8208;Loading Polymer Anode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cheap, fast (100 A g&#8722;1), stable (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), and high&#8208;loading (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) polymer anode is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte, surpassing the Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal has shown promise as an anode material for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet is challenged by dendritic growth and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, an ultrafast, stable, and high&#8208;loading polymer anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors (ZIBs and ZICs) is developed by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte. The anode polymer is rationally prepared to have a suitable electronic structure and a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, whereas the electrolyte is manufactured based on the superiority of triflate anions over sulfate anions, as analyzed and confirmed via experiments and simulations. This dual engineering results in an optimal polymer anode with a low discharge potential, near&#8208;theoretical capacity, ultrahigh&#8208;loading capability (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), ultrafast rate (100 A g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (one million cycles). Its mechanism involves reversible Zn2+/proton co&#8208;storage at the carbonyl site. When the polymer anode is coupled with cathodes for both ZIB and ZIC applications, the devices demonstrate ultrahigh power densities and ultralong lifespans, far surpassing those of corresponding Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Local coordination regulation through tuning atomic scale cavities of Pd metallene toward efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates overtakes significant role in rational design of high&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Long serving as a reliable strategy to tune geometric structure of nanomaterials, defect engineering enjoys great ability to adjust the coordination environment of catalytic active sites, which enables dominant regulation of adsorption energy and kinetics of ORR catalysis. However, limited to controllable nanocrystals fabrication, inducing uniformly&#8208;dispersed high&#8208;coordinated defects into ultrathin 2D nanosheets remains challenging. Herein, we first propose atomic scale cavities (ASCs) as a new kind of high&#8208;coordinated active site and succeed in introducing them into suprathin Pd (111)&#8208;exposed metallene. Due to its atomic concave architecture, leading to elevated CN and moderately downshifted d&#8208;band center, the as&#8208;made Pd metallene with ASCs (c&#8208;Pd M) exhibits excellent ORR performances with mass activity of 2.76 A mgPd&#8211;1 at 0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and half&#8208;wave potential as high as 0.947&#160;V, which is 18.9 (2.7) times higher and 104 (46) mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C (Pd metallene without ASCs). Besides, the durability of c&#8208;Pd M exceeds its commercial counterpart with approximately 30% loss after 5000 cycles. This work enlightens new&#8208;style mentality of designing fancy active sites toward efficient ORR electrocatalysis.

         <title>Structural Dynamics and Tunability for Colloidal Tin Halide Perovskite Nanostructures</title>

Abstract
Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are highly attractive for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics because they are easy to synthesize and offer great compositional and morphological tunability. However, the replacement of lead by tin for sustainability reasons is hampered by the unstable nature of Sn2+ oxidation state and by an insufficient understanding of the chemical processes involved in the synthesis. Here we demonstrate an optimized synthetic route to obtain stable, tunable, and monodisperse CsSnI3 nanocrystals, exhibiting well defined excitonic peaks. Similar to lead halide perovskites, we prepare these nanocrystals by combining a precursor mixture of SnI2, oleylamine and oleic acid, with a Cs&#8208;oleate precursor. Among the products, nanocrystals with 10&#160;nm lateral size in the &#947;&#8208;orthorhombic phase prove to be the most stable. To achieve such stability, an excess of precursor SnI2 as well as sub&#8208;stoichiometric Sn:ligand ratios are key. Structural, compositional and optical investigations complemented by first&#8208;principle DFT calculations confirm that nanocrystal nucleation and growth follow the formation of (R&#8208;NH3+)2SnI4 nanosheets with R = C18H35. Under specific synthetic conditions, stable mixtures of 3D nanocrystals CsSnI3 and 2D nanosheets (Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (R&#8208;NH3+)2Csn&#8208;1SnnI3n+1 with n&gt;1) are obtained. These results set a path to exploiting the high potential of Sn halide perovskite nanocrystals for opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>In Situ Fabrication of Porous CoxP Hierarchical Nanostructures on Carbon Fiber Cloth with Exceptional Performance for Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;valence strategy and construction of an &#8220;all in one&#8221; electrode is employed to prepare flexible carbon fiber cloth supported porous CoxP hierarchical structures comprising nanoneedles and nanosheets. The as&#8208;prepared CoxP@CFC electrode exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;storage performance with a high reversible capacity (814&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate performance (279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and record ultralong cycling life (almost 100%&#160;capacity retention after 9000&#160;cycles).








Abstract
Superior high&#8208;rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium&#8208;ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record&#8208;high capacity of 279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.

         <title>Automated Laser&#8208;Transfer Synthesis of High&#8208;Density Microarrays for Infectious Disease Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated laser&#8208;based synthesis machine is presented, combining laser&#8208;induced forward transfer and robotics to perform parallel chemistry in the microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. By developing an optimization pipeline, peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences can be synthesized in high yield to study the antibody responses in infectious disease patients.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) is a rapid laser&#8208;patterning technique for high&#8208;throughput combinatorial synthesis directly on glass slides. A lack of automation and precision limits LIFT applications to simple proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept syntheses of fewer than 100 compounds. Here, an automated synthesis instrument is reported that combines laser transfer and robotics for parallel synthesis in a microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. An optimized pipeline for amide bond formation is the basis for preparing complex peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences in high yield with high reproducibility. The resulting peptide arrays are of higher quality than commercial peptide arrays. More than 4800 15&#8208;residue peptides resembling the entire Ebola virus proteome on a microarray are synthesized to study the antibody response of an Ebola virus infection survivor. Known and unknown epitopes that serve now as a basis for Ebola diagnostic development are identified. The versatility and precision of the synthesizer is demonstrated by in situ synthesis of fluorescent molecules via Schiff base reaction and multi&#8208;step patterning of precisely definable amounts of fluorophores. This automated laser transfer synthesis approach opens new avenues for high&#8208;throughput chemical synthesis and biological screening.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Electrochemical Transistors Based on Self&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polyelectrolytes for Reconfigurable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With PCPDTBT&#8208;SO3K (CPE&#8208;K) as the active material, dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors that operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode are demonstrated. Mode switching is done via changing the polarity of the applied voltages, enabled by the dual&#8208;mode absorption capabilities of CPE&#8208;K. These transistors are used to create reconfigurable logic gates, paving the way for the use of organic electrochemical transistors in emerging reconfigurable electronics.








Abstract
Reconfigurable organic logic devices are promising candidates for next generations of efficient computing systems and adaptive electronics. Ideally, such devices would be of simple structure and design, be power efficient, and compatible with high&#8208;throughput microfabrication techniques. This work reports an organic reconfigurable logic gate based on novel dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which employ a self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte as the active material, which then allows the transistors to operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode. Furthermore, mode switching is accomplished by simply altering the polarity of the applied gate and drain voltages, which can be done on the fly. In contrast, achieving similar mode&#8208;switching functionality with other organic transistors typically requires complex molecular design or multi&#8208;device engineering. It in shown that dual&#8208;mode functionality is enabled by the concurrent existence of anion doping and cation dedoping of the films. A device physics model that accurately describes the behavior of these transistors is developed. Finally, the utility of these dual&#8208;mode transistors for implementing reconfigurable logic by fabricating a logic gate that may be switched between logic gates AND to NOR, and OR to NAND on the fly is demonstrated.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Scale Approach for Modeling the Optical Response of Molecular Materials Inside Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical cavities filled with molecular materials are under intense experimental investigation. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging because physics, chemistry, and material science are intertwined together across spatial scales ranging from &#229;ngstr&#246;ms to millimeters. A new methodology uses quantum&#8208;chemistry calculations to predict the optical response of devices such as cavities filled with molecular materials.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Optical cavities filled with molecular materials are under intense experimental investigation. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging because physics, chemistry, and material science are intertwined together across spatial scales ranging from &#229;ngstr&#246;ms to millimeters. A new methodology uses quantum-chemistry calculations to predict the optical response of devices such as cavities filled with molecular materials.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polymer Nanoparticles for Efficient Delivery of Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein With or Without Donor DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). In this work, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles, capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (NHEJ&#8208;NP) or together with donor DNA (HDR&#8208;NP), are developed for gene editing in mouse liver, lung, or skeletal muscle.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9) may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). However, clinical translation of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ&#8208;NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR&#8208;NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm) are reported. Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ&#8208;NP induces efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR&#8208;NP also leads to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ&#8208;NP and HDR&#8208;NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.

         <title>Production of Large&#8208;Area Nucleus&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene&#8208;Mesh Metamaterials with Zigzag Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable production approach of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials with zigzag edges is presented. The isotopic labeling approach and the high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization nucleus etching method are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films on a Cu(111) substrate without chemical contamination and physical contact. The findings of this study provide insights for producing resist&#8208;free high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional metamaterial films.








Abstract
In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices. Herein, the controlled production of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films with zigzag edges is demonstrated. The 13C&#8208;isotopic labeling graphene&#8208;growth approach, large&#8208;area Raman mapping techniques, and a uniquely designed high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization etching method are utilized to directly remove the graphene nuclei. Subsequently, a hydrogen&#8208;assisted anisotropic etching process is employed for transforming irregular edges into zigzag edges within the hexagonal&#8208;shaped holes, producing a large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;quality graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial film on a Cu(111) substrate. The carrier mobilities of the fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors on the as&#8208;produced films are measured. The findings of this study enable the large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials and provide insights for the application of integrated circuits based on graphene and other 2D metamaterials.

         <title>Studying Complex Evolution of Hyperelastic Materials Under External Field Stimuli Use Artificial Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Features in Small&#8208;Scale Dataset</title>

Abstract
Deep learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive&#8208;scale experimental data or open&#8208;source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low&#8208;dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high&#8208;precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (CBLSTM) model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability has been designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.

         <title>Engineered Nanoerythrocyte Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microglial polarization is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti&#8208;inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half&#8208;life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, we developed an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 translocation. Moreover, anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforce the anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. In the middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis was achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti&#8208;inflammatory factors, reduced BBB permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocyte as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.

Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is currently recognized as one of the most significant public health issues and affects the general well&#8208;being of millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advances in nerve tissue engineering, nerve repair still cannot guarantee complete functional recovery. In the present study, we adopted an innovative approach to establish a multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted MiDs, which could integrate the powerful programmability, permeability, and structural stability of tFNAs, with the nerve regeneration potential of microRNA&#8208;22 to enhance the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages for more effective functional rehabilitation of peripheral nerves. Relevant results demonstrated that MiDs could amplify the ability of SCs to recruit macrophages and facilitate their polarization into the pro&#8208;healing M2 phenotype to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment. Furthermore, MiDs could initiate the adaptive intracellular reprogramming of SCs within a short period to further promote axon regeneration and remyelination. MiDs represent a new possibility for enhancing nerve repair and may have critical clinical applications in the future.

Abstract
Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) has been identified as a key driver for epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI) resistance. Inhibition of YAP expression could be a potential therapeutic option for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, we propose a nano&#8208;cocktail therapeutic strategy by employing an amphiphilic and block dendritic polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted co&#8208;delivery of EGFR&#8208;TKI gefitinib (Gef) and YAP&#8208;siRNA to achieve a targeted drug/gene/photodynamic therapy. The resulting NPs are effectively internalized into Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC cells, successfully escape from late endosomes/lysosomes, and responsively release Gef and YAP&#8208;siRNA in an intracellular reductive environment. They preferentially accumulate at the tumor site after intravenous injection in both cell line&#8208;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models of Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC, resulting in potent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy without distinct toxicity after laser irradiation. Mechanism studies reveal that the cocktail therapy could block the EGFR signaling pathway with Gef, inhibit activation of the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA and induce tumor cell apoptosis through photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, this combination nanomedicine could sensitize PDT and impair glycolysis by down&#8208;regulating HIF&#8208;1&#945;. These results suggest that this stimuli&#8208;responsive dendritic polymer&#8208;based nano&#8208;cocktail therapy may provide a promising approach for the treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI resistant NSCLC.

         <title>Recent Advances in Intelligent Wearable Medical Devices Integrating Biosensing and Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) are intensively investigated for personalized healthcare and smart therapy. Recent advances in wearable biosensing&#8722;delivery integrated therapeutic systems are summarized, with an emphasis on functional materials, responsiveness models, working mechanisms, and practices, to provide deep insights into the design, fabrication, and bioapplication of IWMDs.








Abstract
The primary roles of precision medicine are to perform real&#8208;time examination, administer on&#8208;demand medication, and apply instruments continuously. However, most current therapeutic systems implement these processes separately, leading to treatment interruption and limited recovery in patients. Personalized healthcare and smart medical treatment have greatly promoted research on and development of biosensing and drug&#8208;delivery integrated systems, with intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) as typical systems, which have received increasing attention because of their non&#8208;invasive and customizable nature. Here, the latest progress in research on IWMDs is reviewed, including their mechanisms of integrating biosensing and on&#8208;demand drug delivery. The current challenges and future development directions of IWMDs are also discussed.

         <title>Direct Ink Writing: A 3D Printing Technology for Diverse Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comprehensive review comprises recent development in direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) 3D printing technology for the development of 3D structures from various materials such as polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and multimaterials. The work describes the fundamentals and engineering of ink rheology required for DIW. In addition, a multitude of applications, current challenges, and future prospects of the technology are discussed.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to drive technological development as a sustainable, flexible, and customizable manufacturing scheme. Among the various AM techniques, direct ink writing (DIW) has emerged as the most versatile 3D printing technique for the broadest range of materials. DIW allows printing of practically any material, as long as the precursor ink can be engineered to demonstrate appropriate rheological behavior. This technique acts as a unique pathway to introduce design freedom, multifunctionality, and stability simultaneously into its printed structures. Here, a comprehensive review of DIW of complex 3D structures from various materials, including polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and their combinations through multimaterial printing is presented. The review begins with an overview of the fundamentals of ink rheology, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various methods to tailor the ink for DIW of different classes of materials. Then, the diverse applications of DIW ranging from electronics to food to biomedical industries are discussed. Finally, the current challenges and limitations of this technique are highlighted, followed by its prospects as&#160;a&#160;guideline toward possible futuristic innovations.

         <title>Rapidly and Repeatedly Reprogrammable Liquid Crystalline Elastomer via a Shape Memory Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;phase LCE network with a crystalline transition temperature above the liquid crystalline transition temperature is designed. The crystalline phase serves as a built&#8208;in physical &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; via its shape memory function. Consequently, the actuation behaviors of the liquid crystal network can be conveniently and repeatedly programmed/reprogrammed within 10 s.








Abstract
Realization of muscle&#8208;like actuation for a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) requires mesogen alignment, which is typically achieved/fixed chemically during the synthesis. Post&#8208;synthesis regulation of the alignment in a convenient and repeatable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Here, a dual&#8208;phase LCE network is designed and synthesized with a crystalline melting transition above a liquid crystalline transition. The crystalline phase can serve as an &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; to fix any mechanical deformation via a shape memory mechanism, leading to corresponding mesogen alignment in the liquid crystalline phase. The alignment can be erased by melting, which can be the starting point for reprogramming. This strategy that relies on a physical shape memory transition for mesogen alignment permits repeated reprogramming in a timescale of seconds, in stark contrast to typical methods. It further leads to unusual versatility in designing 3D printed LCE with unlimited programmable actuation modes.

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of High&#8208;Yield Red Fluorescent Carbon Dots with Ultra&#8208;Narrow Emission by Controlled O/N Elements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;narrow emission and high yield red fluorescent carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) are prepared using o&#8208;phenylenediamine through hydrothermal method by increasing the degree of dehydration and carbonization and the conversion rate of polymerization, respectively. The emission and synthesis mechanisms are discussed. Furthermore, a logarithmic relationship on the aggregation&#8208;induced emission of r&#8208;CDs and a highly ordered graphite nitrate&#8208;like structure are found.








Abstract
Red fluorescent carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) with narrow dual emissions (600&#160;nm and 658&#8211;683&#160;nm, full width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 20&#160;nm and 30&#160;nm), fluorescence quantum yield of 41.0%, and yield of 83.3% are prepared by hydrothermal method using o&#8208;phenylenediamine as precursor and inorganic oxidant as yield enhancer, and they have graphite nitrate&#8208;like structures. The long&#8208;wavelength side emission is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). A logarithmic relationship between the AIE wavelength (y) and the concentration (x) (y&#160;=&#160;8.853ln(x)&#160;+&#160;688.53, R&#160;=&#160;0.998) is found.

     alt="Hydrothermal Synthesis of High-Yield Red Fluorescent Carbon Dots with Ultra-Narrow Emission by Controlled O/N Elements"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-narrow emission and high yield red fluorescent carbon dots (r-CDs) are prepared using &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediamine through hydrothermal method by increasing the degree of dehydration and carbonization and the conversion rate of polymerization, respectively. The emission and synthesis mechanisms are discussed. Furthermore, a logarithmic relationship on the aggregation-induced emission of r-CDs and a highly ordered graphite nitrate-like structure are found.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red fluorescent carbon dots (r-CDs) with narrow dual emissions (600&#160;nm and 658&#8211;683&#160;nm, full width at half-maximums (FWHMs) of 20&#160;nm and 30&#160;nm), fluorescence quantum yield of 41.0%, and yield of 83.3% are prepared by hydrothermal method using &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediamine as precursor and inorganic oxidant as yield enhancer, and they have graphite nitrate-like structures. The long-wavelength side emission is aggregation-induced emission (AIE). A logarithmic relationship between the AIE wavelength (&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;) and the concentration (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) (&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;8.853ln(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;)&#160;+&#160;688.53, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.998) is found. This regularity and the high monochromaticity of AIE are related to the existence of highly ordered structures proved by X-ray diffraction. Its intrinsic emission (FWHM: 20&#160;nm) is the narrowest among the r-CDs prepared by hydrothermal method. The reason is that the decrease of oxygen content makes the FWHMs become narrow, and the decrease of the pyridine nitrogen content and the increase of pyrrole nitrogen content make them narrower further.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy and Stable Subfreezing Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Batteries with Selective and Pseudocapacitive Zn&#8208;Ion Insertion in MnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable cycling of experimentally verified unit level 148 Wh kg&#8722;1 aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries is reported at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This battery utilizes antifreezing aqueous Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte, and has selective Zn&#8208;ion insertion instead of the problematic proton insertion at subfreezing temperatures. The selective Zn&#8208;ion insertion is primarily pseudocapacitive, and delivers outstanding rate performance with 80% capacity retention for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
One major challenge of aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries for practical applications is their unacceptable performance below freezing temperatures. Here the use of simple Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes is described for all&#8208;weather Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries even down to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. The symmetric, bulky ClO4&#8722; anion effectively disrupts hydrogen bonds between water molecules and provides intrinsic ion diffusion even while frozen, and enables &#8776;260 mAh g&#8722;1 on MnO2 cathodes at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C . It is identified that subfreezing cycling shifts the reaction mechanism on the MnO2 cathode from unstable H+ insertion to predominantly pseudocapacitive Zn2+ insertion, which converts MnO2 nanofibers into complicated zincated MnOx that are largely disordered and appeared as crumpled paper sheets. The Zn2+ insertion at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is faster and much more stable than at 20&#160;&#176;C, and delivers &#8776;80% capacity retention for 1000 cycles without Mn2+ additives. In addition, simple Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte also enables a nearly fully reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C with &#8776;98% Coulombic efficiency. Zn&#8211;MnO2 prototypes with an experimentally verified unit energy density of 148 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive ratio of 1.5 and an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio of 2.0 are further demonstrated.

Abstract
Uneven distribution of electric fields at electrolyte&#8208;anode interface and associated Zn dendrite growth is one of the most critical barriers that limit the lifespan of aqueous zinc ion battery (AZIB). Herein, we develop new&#8208;type Zn&#8208;A&#8208;O (A = Si, Ti) interface layers with thin and uniform thickness, porosity, and hydrophilicity properties to realize homogeneous and smooth Zn plating. For ZnSiO3 nanosheet arrays on Zn foil (Zn@ZSO), their formation follows an &#8220;etching&#8208;nucleation&#8208;growth&#8221; mechanism that confirmed by well&#8208;designed Zn island based identical&#8208;location microscopy method, and the geometric area of which is up to 1000 cm2 in one&#8208;pot synthesis based on low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemical method. Guided by the structural advantages of the ZSO layer, Zn2+ flux gets equalized. Besides ultra&#8208;low polarization, the lifespans of symmetric cells and full cells coupled with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading K0.27MnO2&#183;0.54H2O (KMO, 8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathode, have increased by 3&#8211;7 times with Zn@ZSO anode. Moreover, the large&#8208;scale preparation Zn@ZSO foil contributes to 0.5 Ah multi&#8208;layer pouch cell with high performance, further confirming its prospect for practical application.

Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is an attractive hole&#8208;transport material for efficient and stable p&#8208;i&#8208;n metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, an undesirable redox reaction occurs at the NiOx/perovskite interface, which results in a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), instability, and phase separation of the NiOx&#8208;based wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (Br&gt;20%). In order to simultaneously address the abovementioned phase separation problem and redox chemistry at the perovskite/NiOx interface, we widened the bandgap from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding inorganic CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters (3 mol%) to the Cs22Br15 perovskite precursor solution. Moreover, adding extra 2 mol% CsCl enriched the NiOx/perovskite interface with Cl, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface, while controlling the Br content to within 15% improved the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single&#8208;junction p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSC increased from 17.82% to 19.76%, which led to the fabrication of highly efficient monolithic p&#8208;i&#8208;n type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCEs of up to 27.26% (certified PCE: 27.15%). We also applied the perovskite to an n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell to deliver a VOC of 1.93 V and a final efficiency of 25.5%. These findings provide critical insight into the fabrication of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites.

However, an undesirable redox reaction occurs at the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface, which results in a low open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Electron&#8208;Driving Observations of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction on Co&#8208;doped CeO2/Crystalline Carbon Nitride S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions</title>

Abstract
Photoexcited dynamic modulation, maximizing the effective utilization of photoinduced electron&#8208;hole pairs, dominates the multiple electrons&#8208;involved reduction pathways for terminal CH4 evolution during CO2 photoreduction. Yet, the site&#8208;specific regulation of directional charge transfer by modification of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has seldom been discussed. Herein, we report an atomic&#8208;level tailoring strategy by anchoring single&#8208;atomic Co into CeO2 co&#8208;catalyst rather than carbon nitride supports, which can selectively favor CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction. Through in situ dynamic tracking investigations, we identify that surface Co&#8208;embedded bimetallic CeCo conjunction is the key feature driving a strong interconnection of dynamical charge states through S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. We demonstrate that the Co&#8208;embedded modification into CeO2 co&#8208;catalysts play a critical effect on directional charge control, accelerating electron driving from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, which thereby promotes electronic transferability for electrons&#8208;involved CH4 formation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoexcited dynamic modulation, maximizing the effective utilization of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, dominates the multiple electrons-involved reduction pathways for terminal CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; evolution during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. Yet, the site-specific regulation of directional charge transfer by modification of S-scheme heterojunction has seldom been discussed. Herein, we report an atomic-level tailoring strategy by anchoring single-atomic Co into CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; co-catalyst rather than carbon nitride supports, which can selectively favor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. Through in situ dynamic tracking investigations, we identify that surface Co-embedded bimetallic CeCo conjunction is the key feature driving a strong interconnection of dynamical charge states through S-scheme heterojunctions. We demonstrate that the Co-embedded modification into CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; co-catalysts play a critical effect on directional charge control, accelerating electron driving from the carbon nitride donations to site-specific Co hubs, which thereby promotes electronic transferability for electrons-involved CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation. As a result, an unprecedented CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yield (181.7&#160;&#956;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is obtained with a high turnover number (411.4) through a fully gas-solid reaction, demonstrating its potential towards targeted CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation without adding any sacrificial agent.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Submolecular Tuning of Ligand Size and Spacing for Dynamic Macrophage Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell adhesion occurs when integrin recognizes and binds to Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp (RGD) ligands present in fibronectin. Herein, submolecular ligand size and spacing is tuned via the template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles for dynamic macrophage modulation. To tune liganded GNP size and spacing from 3 to 20&#160;nm, in situ localized assembly of gold nanoparticle (GNP) arrays on nano&#8208;magnetite templates are engineered. 3&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands stimulate the binding of integrin that mediates macrophage adhesion&#8208;assisted pro&#8208;regenerative polarization as compared to the 20&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands, which can be dynamically anchored to the substrate for stabilizing integrin binding and facilitating dynamic macrophage adhesion. Increasing the ligand size from 7 to 20&#160;nm only slightly promotes macrophage adhesion, not observed with 13&#160;nm&#8208;sized ligands. Increasing the ligand spacing from 3 to 17&#160;nm significantly hinders macrophage adhesion that induces inflammatory polarization. Submolecular tuning of ligand spacing can dominantly modulate host macrophages.

         <title>Optimally&#8208;Tailored Spinodal Architected Materials for Multiscale Design and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy directly target stiffness and lightweightness in optimal design and indirectly promote biological functions via microscale porosity and randomness. Their functional representation is also exploited for scalable multiscale manufacturing. As an example, a multiscale craniofacial implant is designed to support masticatory forces and microscale porosity is tailored upon manufacturing to promote bone regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. By locally varying the spinodal class, orientation, and porosity during topology optimization, a large portion of the anisotropic material space is exploited such that material is efficiently placed along principal stress trajectories at the microscale. Additionally, the bicontinuous, nonperiodic, unstructured, and stochastic nature of spinodal architected materials promotes mechanical and biological functions not explicitly considered during optimization (e.g., insensitivity to imperfections, fluid transport conduits). Furthermore, in contrast to laminated composites or periodic, structured architected materials (e.g., lattices), the functional representation of spinodal architected materials leads to multiscale, optimized designs with clear physical interpretation that can be manufactured directly, without special treatment at spinodal transitions. Physical models of the optimized, spinodal&#8208;embedded parts are manufactured using a scalable, voxel&#8208;based strategy to communicate with a masked stereolithography (m&#8208;SLA) 3D&#160;printer.

         <title>Crosstalk&#8208;Free, High&#8208;Resolution Pressure Sensor Arrays Enabled by High&#8208;Throughput Laser Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution flexible pressure sensor array with individual sensing pixels and their interconnects is sequentially defined by laser&#8208;induced graphenization and ablation to minimize crosstalk interferences. The new geometry of the interconnects induces a remarkable reduction of the crosstalk coefficient and enables a record high resolution of the sensor array.








Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high spatial resolution and low crosstalk interference has been a fundamental challenge for flexible pressure sensor arrays. Here the authors present a high&#8208;resolution flexible pressure sensor array fabricated through a two&#8208;step laser manufacturing process, where individual sensing pixels and their interconnects are sequentially defined by laser&#8208;induced graphenization and ablation to minimize crosstalk interferences. The geometry of the interconnects is optimized through theoretical modeling and experimental validation. Characterization results show that the new device design induces a remarkable reduction of the crosstalk coefficient, from &#8722;8.21 to &#8722;43.63 dB, of the 0.7 mm&#8208;resolution sensor arrays, and the crosstalk suppression is particularly beneficial for application scenarios involving pressure sensing on soft surfaces (e.g., human skin and organs). Applications of the sensor array in tactile pattern recognition and minimally&#8208;invasive cancer surgery are demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
In this work, a gesture recognition wristband for virtual reality application with excellent prediction accuracy and good wearing experience is manufactured. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;wear wristband can translate and broadcast sign language words in real time with a prediction accuracy over 92.6%.

Abstract
Virtual reality is a brand&#8208;new technology that can be applied extensively. To realize virtual reality, certain types of human&#8211;computer interaction equipment are necessary. Existing virtual reality technologies often rely on cameras, data gloves, game pads, and other equipment. These equipment are either bulky, inconvenient to carry and use, or expensive to popularize. Therefore, the development of a convenient and low&#8208;cost high&#8208;precision human&#8211;computer interaction device can contribute positively to the development of virtual reality technology. In this study, a gesture recognition wristband that can realize a full keyboard and multicommand input is developed. The wristband is convenient to wear, low in cost, and does not affect other daily operations of the hand. This wristband is based on physiological anatomy as well as aided by active sensor and machine learning technology; it can achieve a maximum accuracy of 92.6% in recognizing 26 letters. This wristband offers broad application prospects in the fields of gesture command recognition, assistive devices for the disabled, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Exchange Bias in Molecule/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructures via Spinterface Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinterface effects are demonstrated in a hybrid van der Waals heterostructure composed of a CoPc film interfaced with a layered ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The interface interactions introduce an exchange bias field in Fe3GeTe2, which is among the strongest reported for layered magnetic materials. The results demonstrate the potential of molecular functionalization for tailoring the magnetic properties of layered materials.








Abstract
The exfoliation of layered magnetic materials generates atomically thin flakes characterized by an ultrahigh surface sensitivity, which makes their magnetic properties tunable via external stimuli, such as electrostatic gating and proximity effects. Another powerful approach to engineer magnetic materials is molecular functionalization, generating hybrid interfaces with tailored magnetic interactions, called spinterfaces. However, spinterface effects have not yet been explored on layered magnetic materials. Here, the emergence of spinterface effects is demonstrated at the interface between flakes of the prototypical layered magnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 and thin films of Co&#8208;phthalocyanine. Magnetotransport measurements show that the molecular layer induces a magnetic exchange bias in Fe3GeTe2, indicating that the unpaired spins in Co&#8208;phthalocyanine develop antiferromagnetic ordering and pin the magnetization reversal of Fe3GeTe2 via magnetic proximity. The effect is strongest for a Fe3GeTe2 thickness of 20 nm, for which the exchange bias field reaches &#8722;840 Oe at 10 K and is measurable up to &#8776;110 K. This value compares very favorably with previous exchange bias fields reported for Fe3GeTe2 in all&#8208;inorganic van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating the potential of molecular functionalization to tailor the magnetism of van der Waals layered materials.

The interface interactions introduce an exchange bias field in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is among the strongest reported for layered magnetic materials. The results demonstrate the potential of molecular functionalization for tailoring the magnetic properties of layered materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exfoliation of layered magnetic materials generates atomically thin flakes characterized by an ultrahigh surface sensitivity, which makes their magnetic properties tunable via external stimuli, such as electrostatic gating and proximity effects. Another powerful approach to engineer magnetic materials is molecular functionalization, generating hybrid interfaces with tailored magnetic interactions, called spinterfaces. However, spinterface effects have not yet been explored on layered magnetic materials. Here, the emergence of spinterface effects is demonstrated at the interface between flakes of the prototypical layered magnetic metal Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and thin films of Co-phthalocyanine. Magnetotransport measurements show that the molecular layer induces a magnetic exchange bias in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, indicating that the unpaired spins in Co-phthalocyanine develop antiferromagnetic ordering and pin the magnetization reversal of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via magnetic proximity. The effect is strongest for a Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thickness of 20 nm, for which the exchange bias field reaches &#8722;840 Oe at 10 K and is measurable up to &#8776;110 K. This value compares very favorably with previous exchange bias fields reported for Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in all-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating the potential of molecular functionalization to tailor the magnetism of van der Waals layered materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Asymmetric Hygroscopic Structure for Moisture&#8208;Driven Hygro&#8208;Ionic Electricity Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual route for moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) is proposed by an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS), which simultaneously achieves MEG and energy storage. The water&#8208;absorption triggered dual function originates from the permanently maintained wet&#8208;dry asymmetry that is formed across the AHS by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a functionalized&#8208;carbon layer.








Abstract
The interactions between moisture and materials give rise to the possibility of moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG). Current MEG materials and devices only establish this interaction during water sorption in specific configurations, and conversion is eventually ceased by saturated water uptake. This paper reports an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS) that simultaneously achieves energy harvesting and storage from moisture absorption. The AHS is constructed by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a layer of functionalized carbon. Water absorbed from the air creates wet&#8208;dry asymmetry across the AHS and hence an in&#8208;plane electric field. The asymmetry can be perpetually maintained even after saturated water absorption. The absorbed water triggers the spontaneous development of an electrical double layer (EDL) over the carbon surface, which is termed a hygro&#8208;ionic process, accounting for the capacitive properties of the AHS. A peak power density of 70 &#181;W cm&#8208;3&#160;was&#160;realized after geometry optimization. The AHS shows the ability to be recharged either by itself owing to a self&#8208;regeneration effect or via external electrical means, which allows it to serve as an energy storage device. In addition to insights into moisture&#8208;material interaction, AHSs further shows potential for electronics powering in assembled devices.

         <title>More powerful twistron carbon nanotube yarn mechanical energy harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretching a coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn can provide large, reversible electrochemical capacitance changes, which convert mechanical energy to electricity. Here we show that the performance of these &#8220;twistron&#8221; harvesters can be increased by optimizing the alignment of precursor CNT forests, plastically stretching the precursor twisted yarn, applying much higher tensile loads during pre&#8208;coiling twist than for coiling, using electrothermal pulse annealing under tension, and incorporating reduced graphene oxide nanoplates. The peak output power for a 1&#160;Hz and a 30&#160;Hz sinusoidal deformation were 0.73 and 3.19&#160;kW kg&#8211;1, which are 24 and 13&#8208;fold that of previous twistron harvesters at these respective frequencies. This performance at 30&#160;Hz was over 12&#8208;fold that of other prior&#8208;art mechanical energy harvesters for frequencies between 0.1&#160;Hz and 600&#160;Hz. The maximum energy conversion efficiency was 7.2&#8208;fold that for previous twistrons. Twistron anode and cathode yarn arrays were stretched 180&#176; out&#8208;of&#8208;phase by locating them in the negative and positive compressibility directions of hinged wine&#8208;rack frames, thereby doubling the output voltage and reducing the input mechanical energy.

Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are highly essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding seven years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are firstly addressed to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematical analysis on the published literatures and cutting&#8208;edge performances are then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progresses and the gap towards practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level is respectively discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives towards high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

         <title>Tunable Planar Focusing Based on Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar polariton focusing device based on the natural in&#8208;plane hyperbolic van der Waals material &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is developed, which achieves ultrahigh field compression and wide&#8208;range tunable performance. Moreover, a graphene/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is constructed, which supports hybrid modes consisting of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 phonon polaritons and graphene plasmons to achieve in situ dynamical control of the focal length.








Abstract
Manipulation of the propagation and energy&#8208;transport characteristics of subwavelength infrared (IR) light fields is critical for the application of nanophotonic devices in photocatalysis, biosensing, and thermal management. In this context, metamaterials are useful composite materials, although traditional metal&#8208;based structures are constrained by their weak mid&#8208;IR response, while their associated capabilities for optical propagation and focusing are limited by the size of attainable artificial optical structures and the poor performance of the available active means of control. Herein, a tunable planar focusing device operating in the mid&#8208;IR region is reported by exploiting highly oriented in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3. Specifically, an unprecedented change of effective focal length of polariton waves from 0.7 to 7.4 &#956;m is demonstrated by the following three different means of control: the dimension of the device, the employed light frequency, and engineering of phonon&#8211;plasmon hybridization. The high confinement characteristics of phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 permit the focal length and focal spot size to be reduced to 1/15 and 1/33 of the incident wavelength, respectively. In particular, the anisotropic phonon polaritons supported in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are combined with tunable surface&#8208;plasmon polaritons in graphene to realize in situ and dynamical control of the focusing performance, thus paving the way for phonon&#8208;polariton&#8208;based planar nanophotonic applications.

Hydrogels of lead telluride nanoparticles are structurally characterized using graph theory. The morphology of the gels is quantified, identifying the effect of various salt concentrations and compositions on the connectivity of the network structures. Significant influence by divalent cations on gel structure is observed. Relationships between the structural descriptors and viscoelastic and charge transport properties are evaluated.








Abstract
Gels self&#8208;assembled from colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) translate the size&#8208;dependent properties of nanostructures to materials with macroscale volumes. Large spanning networks of NP chains provide high interconnectivity within the material necessary for a wide range of properties from conductivity to viscoelasticity. However, a great challenge for nanoscale engineering of such gels lies in being able to accurately and quantitatively describe their complex non&#8208;crystalline structure that combines order and disorder. The quantitative relationships between the mesoscale structural and material properties of nanostructured gels are currently unknown. Here, it is shown that lead telluride NPs spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into a spanning network hydrogel. By applying graph theory (GT), a method for quantifying the complex structure of the NP gels is established using a topological descriptor of average nodal connectivity that is found to correlate with the gel's mechanical and charge transport properties. GT descriptions make possible the design of non&#8208;crystalline porous materials from a variety of nanoscale components for photonics, catalysis, adsorption, and thermoelectrics.

         <title>Biaxial Strained MoS2 Nanoshells with Controllable Layers Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Strain in layered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a type of effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance by activating their inert basal plane. However, compared with the traditional uniaxial strain, the influence of biaxial one and TMDs layer number on local electronic configuration remains unexplored. Herein, via a new in situ self&#8208;vulcanization strategy, we realize biaxial strained MoS2 nanoshells in the form of single&#8208;crystalline Ni3S2@MoS2 core&#8208;shell heterostructure, where the MoS2 layer is precisely controlled between 1 to 5 layers. In particular, the electrode with bilayer MoS2 nanoshells shows a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 78.1&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and negligible activity degradation after durability test. Density Functional Theory calculations reveal the contribution of optimized biaxial strain together with the induced sulfur vacancies and identify the origin of superior catalytic sites in these biaxial&#8208;strained MoS2 nanoshells. This work highlights the importance of the atomic&#8208;scale layer number and multiaxial strain in unlocking the potential of two&#8208;dimensional TMDs electrocatalysts.

         <title>Visualizing ultrafast defect&#8208;controlled interlayer electron&#8208;phonon coupling in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineering ultrafast interlayer coupling provides access to new quantum phenomena and novel device functionalities in atomically thin van der Waals heterostructures. However, due to all the atoms of a monolayer material being exposed at the interfaces, the interlayer coupling is extremely susceptible to defects, resulting in high energy dissipation through heat and low device performance. The study of how defects affect the interlayer coupling at ultrafast and atomic scales remains a challenge. Here, using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy, a new defect&#8208;induced ultrafast interlayer electron&#8208;phonon coupling pathway is identified in a WS2/graphene heterostructure, involving a three&#8208;body collision between electrons in WS2 and both acoustic phonons and defects in graphene. This interaction manifests as the reduced defect&#8208;related Raman resonant activity and the accelerated electron&#8208;phonon scattering time from 7.1&#160;ps to 2.4&#160;ps. Furthermore, we directly image the ultrafast interlayer coupling process. These insights will advance our fundamental knowledge of the heat dissipation in nanoscale devices, and enable new ways to dynamically manipulate electrons and phonons via defects in van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Magnetic Microswarm and Fluoroscopy&#8208;Guided Platform for Biofilm Eradication in Biliary Stents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biofilm eradication from medical implants is of fundamental importance, and the treatment of biofilm&#8208;associated pathogen infections on inaccessible biliary stents remains challenging. Magnetically driven microrobots with controlled motility, accessibility to the tiny lumen, and swarm enhancement effects can physically disrupt the deleterious biostructures while not developing drug resistance. We&#160;design magnetic urchin&#8208;like capsule robots (MUCRs) loaded with magnetic liquid metal droplets (MLMDs, antibacterial agents) using natural sunflower pollen, and explore the therapeutic effect of swarming MUCR@MLMDs for eradicating complex mixtures of bacterial biofilm within biliary stents collected from patients. The external magnetic field triggers the emergence of the microswarm and induces MLMDs to transform their shape into spheroids and rods with sharp edges. The inherent natural microspikes of MUCRs and the obtained sharp edges of MLMDs actively rupture the dense biological matrix and multiple species of embedded bacterial cells by exerting mechanical force, finally achieving synergistic biofilm eradication. The microswarm is precisely and rapidly deployed into the biliary stent via endoscopy in 10 minutes. Notably, fluoroscopy imaging is used to track and navigate the locomotion of microswarm in biliary stents in real&#8208;time. The microswarm has great potential for treating bacterial biofilm infections associated with medical&#160;implants.

         <title>Activated Ni&#8208;OH Bond in Catalyst Facilitates Nucleophile Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is of enormous significance for organic electrosynthesis and coupling for hydrogen generation. However, non&#8208;uniform NOR mechanism limits its development. For NOR involving electrocatalysis and organic chemistry, both the electrochemical step and non&#8208;electrochemical process should be taken into account. The NOR of nickel&#8208;based hydroxides includes the electrogenerated dehydrogenation of Ni2+&#8208;OH bond and spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process; the former determines electrochemical activity, and nucleophile oxidation pathway depends on the latter. Herein, we report the space&#8208;confinement&#8208;induced synthesis of Ni3Fe layered double hydroxide intercalated with single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt nanosheets (Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS). The synergy of interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects activates Ni&#8208;OH bonds, thus exhibiting an excellent NOR performance. The spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps of NOR were revealed, such as proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET; Ni3+&#8208;O + X&#8208;H = Ni2+&#8208;OH + X&#8226;), hydration, and rearrangement. Hence, the reaction pathway of NOR was deciphered, which not only helps to perfect NOR mechanism, but also provides inspiration for organic electrosynthesis.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Built Gating Boost Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221; is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. A catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst of ReS2&#8208;WS2/WS2 hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide the electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with electron&#8208;rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) obtained under the electric field for ReS2&#8208;WS2/WS2 catalyst with dual self&#8208;built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) of pure WS2 catalyst, which exhibits nearly 4 times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;) obtained under the electric field for ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with dual self-built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of pure WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, which exhibits nearly 4 times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>van der Waals Exfoliation Processed Biopiezoelectric Submucosa Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted significant attention due to the potential effect of piezoelectricity on biological tissues and their versatile applications. However, the high cost and complexity of assembling and domain aligning biomolecules at a large scale, and the disordered arrangement of piezoelectric domains as well as the lack of ferroelectricity in natural biological tissues remain a roadblock toward practical applications. Here, utilizing the weak van der Waals interaction in the layered structure of small intestinal submucosa (SIS), we report a van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) process to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of the effective piezoelectric domain. Based on that, we reveal the piezoelectric property of SIS stemming from the collagen fibril, with piezoelectric coefficients up to 4.1 pm V&#8211;1 and in&#8208;plane polarization orientation parallel to the fibril axis. Furthermore, a biosensor based on the vdWE&#8208;processed SIS film with an in&#8208;plane electrode is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of approximately 250&#160;mV under the cantilever vibration condition. The vdWE method shows great potential in facilely fabricating ultrathin films of soft tissues and biosensors.

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Group Spacers in Glycolated Copolymers for High Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Semiconducting polymers with oligoethylene glycol sidechains have attracted strong research interest for organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) applications. However, key molecular design rules for high&#8208;performance OECTs via efficient mixed electronic/ionic charge transport are still unclear. Herein, we&#160;synthesize and characterize new glycolated copolymers (gDPP&#8208;TTT and gDPP&#8208;TTVTT) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and thiophene&#8208;based (TTT or TTVTT) donor units for accumulation mode OECTs, where a long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group (C12) attached to DPP unit acts as a spacer distancing the oligoethylene glycol from the polymer backbone. gDPP&#8208;TTVTT shows the highest OECT transconductance (61.9 S cm&#8211;1) and high operational stability, compared to gDPP&#8208;TTT and their alkylated counterparts. Surprisingly, gDPP&#8208;TTVTT also shows high electronic charge mobility in field&#8208;effect transistor, suggesting efficient ion injection/diffusion without hindering its efficient electronic charge transport. The elongated donor unit (TTVTT) facilitates the hole polaron formation more localized to the donor unit, leading to faster and easier polaron formation with less impact on polymer structure during OECT operation, as opposed to the TTT unit. This is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We&#160;conclude that these simultaneously high electronic and ionic charge transport properties are achieved due to the long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer in amphipathic sidechains, providing an important molecular design rule for glycolated copolymers.

         <title>Studying plasmon dispersion of MXene for enhanced electromagnetic absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising candidates for electromagnetic (EM) shielding, saturable absorption, thermal therapy, and photocatalysis due to their excellent performance in EM absorption. Although the plasmon resonance in MXene can play a role in the EM absorption, such an effect has never been quantitatively analyzed yet due to the lack of knowledge of the plasmon dispersion of MXene, which is challengeable to measure for optical methods. Here, we measure the plasmon dispersions (frequency&#8208;momentum relation) for individual MXene nanoflakes with varied thicknesses by using the high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, which is corroborated by EM theoretical calculation. The plasmon dispersions show that plasmon frequency can be continuously modulated in the ultrabroad band (frequency domain below near&#8208;infrared) by changing the momentum (e.g., via control of the flake size). The increasing plasmon compression effect in flakes with decreasing layer number indicates that increasing the interlayer distance can effectively improve the plasmon compression and thus increase the EM absorption. For example, a 3&#160;nm interlayer distance can nearly double the plasmon&#8208;enhanced EM absorption in MXene nanostructures. Our work provides guidance for the design of advanced ultra&#8208;thin EM absorption materials for wide applications such as EM absorbers, EM shielding devices, photothermal and photocatalysis devices.

         <title>Vertical&#8208;Graphene&#8208;Reinforced Titanium Alloy Bipolar Plates in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directly grown vertical graphene (VG) coating is demonstrated to reinforce Ti alloy bipolar plates in fuel cells. Thus, the interfacial contact resistance of as&#8208;fabricated VG&#8208;coated Ti alloy decreases by &#8776;100 times compared with bare Ti alloy and its corrosion rate reduces by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in simulated proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) operating environments.








Abstract
The bipolar plate (BP) serves as one of the crucial components in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Among BP materials, metallic BPs are widely employed due to their outstanding comprehensive properties. However, the interfacial contact resistance (ICR) between BP and gas diffusion layer together with corrosion of metallic BP under acidic operating conditions degrades the performance and stability of PEMFCs. Herein, an approach is proposed for the surface reinforcement of titanium (Ti) alloy BPs, relying on a directly grown vertical graphene (VG) coating via the plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. Compared with bare Ti alloy, the corrosion rate of VG&#8208;coated Ti alloy reduces by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in the simulated PEMFC operating environments and ICR decreases by &#8776;100 times, while its thermal conductivity improves by &#8776;20% and water contact angle increases by 68.1&#176;. The results can be interpreted that the unique structure of VG enables excellent electrical and thermal conduction in PEMFCs, and the highly hydrophobic VG coating suppresses the penetration of corrosive liquid as well as contributing to water management. This study opens a new opportunity to reinforce metallic surfaces by the robust and versatile VG coating for high&#8208;performance electrodes used in energy and catalyst applications.

         <title>PET&#8208;CT Imaging of Polymeric Nanoparticle Tumor Accumulation in Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the docetaxel&#8208;entrapping polymeric nanoparticle CPC634 is radiolabeled with 89Zr and its potential as clinical tool for patients selection before starting treatment is evaluated. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of seven patients with solid tumors reveals that a low diagnostic dose of 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 accurately reflects on&#8208;treatment tumor accumulation which opens the possibility for patient stratification in cancer nanomedicine with polymeric nanoparticles.








Abstract
Several FDA/EMA&#8208;approved nanomedicines have demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles compared to their conventional chemotherapeutic counterparts. The next step to increase therapeutic efficacy depends on tumor accumulation, which can be highly heterogeneous. A clinical tool for patient stratification is urgently awaited. Therefore, a docetaxel&#8208;entrapping polymeric nanoparticle (89Zr&#8208;CPC634) is radiolabeled, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging is performed in seven patients with solid tumors with two different doses of CPC634: an on&#8208;treatment (containing 60 mg m&#8722;2 docetaxel) and a diagnostic (1&#8211;2 mg docetaxel) dose (NCT03712423). Pharmacokinetic half&#8208;life for 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 is mean 97.0 &#177; 14.4 h on&#8208;treatment, and 62.4 &#177; 12.9 h for the diagnostic dose (p&#160;= 0.003). At these doses accumulation is observed in 46% and 41% of tumor lesions with a median accumulation in positive lesions 96 h post&#8208;injection of 4.94 and 4.45%IA kg&#8722;1 (p&#160;= 0.91), respectively. In conclusion, PET/CT imaging with a diagnostic dose of 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 accurately reflects on&#8208;treatment tumor accumulation and thus opens the possibility for patient stratification in cancer nanomedicine with polymeric nanoparticles.

The next step to increase therapeutic efficacy depends on tumor accumulation, which can be highly heterogeneous. A clinical tool for patient stratification is urgently awaited. Therefore, a docetaxel-entrapping polymeric nanoparticle (&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Zr-CPC634) is radiolabeled, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging is performed in seven patients with solid tumors with two different doses of CPC634: an on-treatment (containing 60 mg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; docetaxel) and a diagnostic (1&#8211;2 mg docetaxel) dose (NCT03712423). Pharmacokinetic half-life for &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Zr-CPC634 is mean 97.0 &#177; 14.4 h on-treatment, and 62.4 &#177; 12.9 h for the diagnostic dose (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0.003). At these doses accumulation is observed in 46% and 41% of tumor lesions with a median accumulation in positive lesions 96 h post-injection of 4.94 and 4.45%IA kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0.91), respectively. In conclusion, PET/CT imaging with a diagnostic dose of &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Zr-CPC634 accurately reflects on-treatment tumor accumulation and thus opens the possibility for patient stratification in cancer nanomedicine with polymeric nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Black Gold Film with Ultrahigh Porosity for Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile dealloying strategy is proposed to fabricate the self&#8208;supporting black gold film with hierarchically porous structure and ultrahigh porosity. Owing to the unique nanoporous nanowire structure, varying nanogaps between the nanowires and massive microgaps, the nanoporous gold film enables efficient broadband absorption, excellent hydrophilicity and continuous water transport, thus achieving highly efficient solar steam generation.








Abstract
Plasmonic metals demonstrate significant potential for solar steam generation (SSG) because of their localized surface plasmon resonance effect. However, the inherently narrow absorption spectra of plasmonic metals significantly limit their applications. The fabrication of nanostructures is essential to achieve broadband solar absorption for high&#8208;efficiency vapor generation. Herein, a self&#8208;supporting black gold (Au) film with an ultrahigh porosity and a hierarchically porous structure is fabricated by formulating an extremely dilute Cu99Au1 precursor and controlling the dealloying process. In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the dealloying mechanism of Cu99Au1 in a 1 m HNO3 solution as that involving the phase transformation of Cu(Au) &#8594; Au(Cu) &#8594; Au, giant volume shrinkage (&#8776;87%), structural evolution/coarsening of ligaments, and development of ultrahigh porosity (86.2%). The multiscale structure, consisting of ultrafine nanoporous nanowires, aligned nanogaps, and various microgaps, provide efficient broadband absorption over 300&#8211;2500&#160;nm, excellent hydrophilicity, and continuous water transport. In particular, the nanoporous black Au film shows high SSG performance with an evaporation rate of 1.51&#160;kg m&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94.5% under a light intensity of 1&#160;kW m&#8211;2. These findings demonstrate that the nanoporous Au film has great potential for clean water production and seawater desalination.

         <title>Diminishing Interfacial Turbulence by Colloid&#8208;Polymer Electrolyte to Stabilize Zinc Ion Flux for Deep&#8208;Cycling Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a new design of colloid&#8208;polymer electrolyte (CPE) for use in Zn metal batteries is proposed to diminish interfacial disturbance and realize stable Zn2+ environment at deep cycling. The efficacies of the designed CPE are determined with a combination of density functional theory, finite element simulation, in situ Raman measurements, and electrochemical tests for Zn&#8208;based cells.








Abstract
The fluidity of aqueous electrolytes and undesired H2 evolution reaction (HER) can cause severe interfacial turbulence in aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs) at deep cycling with high capacities and current densities, which would further perturb ion flux and aggravate Zn dendrite growth. In this study, a colloid&#8208;polymer electrolyte (CPE) with special colloidal phase and suppressed HER is designed to diminish interfacial turbulence and boost deep Zn electrochemistry. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the quantitative migratory barriers of Zn2+ along the transport pathway in CPE demonstrate much smaller fluctuations compared with normal aqueous electrolyte, indicating that CPE can effectively diminish interfacial disturbance. Benefitting from this, the Zn2+ ion flux can be homogenized and deposited evenly on the electrode, which is confirmed by finite element simulation and in situ Raman measurements. Consequently, CPE enables stable operation of Zn//Cu cells even with high capacity (up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2) and current density (up to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Zn//Na5V12O32 full&#8208;cell with N/P ratio as low as 1 (i.e., 100%&#160;Zn utilization). It is believed that this strategy opens a brand&#8208;new avenue based on CPE toward boosting deep&#8208;cycling electrochemistry in ZMBs and even other aqueous energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Establishing Thermal Infusion Method for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile thermal infusion approach is used to construct the multilevel electrode structure based on the porous Cu host for Zn metal anodes. The composite anode regulates the Zn deposition and inhibits the side reactions due to the in situ Cu&#8211;Zn solid solution and ZnO layer, thus achieving long&#8208;cycling aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Metallic zinc (Zn) having low cost, high capacity, environmentally friendly features is considered to be an attractive anode material for aqueous energy storage devices. However, dendritic growth and severe side reactions restrict the development of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Numerous 3D hosts are extensively explored to settle these issues, whereas the accessible prestoring of Zn metal into structured electrodes is challenging. Here, a thermal infusion strategy is first reported to create a stable composite Zn&#8208;based anode. Upon this melting&#8211;wetting&#8211;cooling process, the metallic Zn is densely and firmly encapsulated in the 3D skeleton, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Meanwhile, through in/ex situ tests, the formation of ZnO layer on the metallic Zn surface inhibits the hydrogen evolution reactions (1.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation during cycling. Consequently, the electrode enables a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell. The pouch cells pairing this novel anode and LiMn2O4 cathode maintain over 94 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity retention after 300 cycles. This research presents an innovative Zn anode structure and extendable prestoring metallic Zn method for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

A new catalog of zero&#8208;strain electrode material made of ultrasmall Si nanodots within metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF)&#8208;derived nanoreactors (Si NDs&#8834;MDN) is developed through a novel space&#8208;confined single&#8208;atom catalytic strategy.

Abstract
Developing zero&#8208;strain electrode materials with high capacity is crucial for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, a new zero&#8208;strain composite material made of ultrasmall Si nanodots (NDs) within metal organic framework&#8208;derived nanoreactors (Si NDs&#8834;MDN) through a novel space&#8208;confined catalytic strategy is reported. The unique Si NDs&#8834;MDN anode features a low strain (&lt;3%) and a high theoretical lithium storage capacity (1524 mAh g&#8208;1) which far surpasses the traditional single&#8208;crystal counterparts that suffer from a low capacity delivery. The zero&#8208;strain property is evidenced by substantial characterizations including ex/in situ transmission electron microscopy and mechanical simulations. The Si NDs&#8834;MDN exhibits superior cycling stability and high reversible capacity (1327 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles) in half&#8208;cells and high energy density (366&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 after 300 cycles) in a full cell. This study reports a new catalog of zero&#8208;strain electrode material with significantly improved capacity beyond the traditional single&#8208;crystal zero&#8208;strain materials.

Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitates the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;coupling, spin&#8208;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. In this perspective article, we review the progress and analyze the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D&#8208;materials to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and provide our insight to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for The Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on the cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In this review, we focus on introducing the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have the ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, this review will discuss the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions from a clinical perspective.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered non&#8208;van der Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was believed that the exfoliation of such materials was enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intra&#8208;layer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of inter&#8208;layer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of non&#8208;layered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here we examine progress in this unexpected new research area. We review the structure and properties of platelets produced by LPE of non&#8208;layered materials. We find a number of unexplained trends, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials which have been exfoliated to give high aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, we consider the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials.

         <title>Recent Structural Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors Incorporating Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of hydrogen bonds can enhance the planarity and rigidity of polymer semiconductors via noncovalent interactions, improve the charge transport, and offer polymers unique superiority of mechanical flexibility. This review describes the recent structural evolution of polymer semiconductors containing hydrogen bonds and the effect of hydrogen bonds on carrier mobility, self&#8208;healing, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Highly planar, extended &#960;&#8208;electron organic conjugated polymers have been increasingly attractive for achieving high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors. In addition to the conventional strategy to construct rigid backbone by covalent bonds, hydrogen bond has been employed extensively to increase the planarity and rigidity of polymer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. This review provides a general summary of high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers incorporating hydrogen bonds in field&#8208;effect transistors over recent years. The structural engineering of the hydrogen bond&#8208;containing building blocks and the discussion of theoretical simulation, microstructural characterization, and device performance are covered. Additionally, the effects of the introduction of hydrogen bond on self&#8208;healing, stretchability, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties are also discussed. The review aims to help and inspire design of new high&#8208;mobility conjugated polymers with superiority of mechanical flexibility by incorporation of hydrogen bond for the application in flexible electronics.

         <title>High Efficiency of over 25% and Long Device Lifetime of over 500 h at 1000 nit in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized tandem device of the multi&#8208;resonance type blue emitter achieves high external quantum efficiency over 25% and extremely long device lifetime of over 500&#160;h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and 30000&#160;h at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 up to 95% of initial luminance.








Abstract
In this study, a multiple resonance (MR) type blue emitter is synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for highly efficient and stable blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The MR blue fluorescent emitter has a di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl benzene substituent in the MR core structure to minimize quenching mechanisms by intermolecular interaction. The emitter shows a high photoluminescence quantum yield and small full width at half maximum of 22 nm, which realize high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.4% in the single unit OLED and device lifetime up to 95% of the initial luminance (LT95) of 208 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and over 10&#160;000 h at 100 cd m&#8722;2. The optimized tandem device of the new blue emitter achieves high EQE over 25% and extremely long LT95 of over 500&#160;h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and 30&#160;000 h at 100 cd m&#8722;2. The lifetime of this work is one of the best data of blue OLED lifetime reported in the literature.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogel for Efficient and Scalable Moisture&#8208;Electric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic hydrogel moisture electric generator (IHMEG) shows high power&#8208;output and stable voltage by virtue of synergistic effect of enhanced moisture&#8208;enabled protons diffusion and long&#8208;maintained water gradient. With easy&#8208;to&#8208;scaleup fabrication, high cost&#8208;efficiency, and wide adaptability to temperature and humidity, the IHMEG device holds great potentials to develop a green, efficient, flexible, and versatile direct&#8208;current power source for Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and wearable electronics.








Abstract
The progress of spontaneous energy generation from ubiquitous moisture is hindered the low output current and intermittent operating voltage of the moisture&#8208;electric generators. Herein a novel and efficient ionic hydrogel moisture&#8208;electric generator (IHMEG) is developed by rational combination of poly(vinyl alcohol), phytic acid, and glycerol&#8208;water binary solvent. Thanks to the synergistic effect of notable moisture&#8208;absorption capability and fast ion transport capability in the ionic hydrogel network, a single IHMEG unit of 0.25 cm2 can continuously generate direct&#8208;current electricity with a constant open&#8208;circuit voltage of &#8776;0.8&#160;V for over 1000 h, a high short&#8208;current density of 0.24 mA cm&#8722;2, and power density of up to 35 &#181;W cm&#8722;2. Of great importance is that large&#8208;scale integration of IHMEG units can be readily accomplished to offer a device with voltage up to 210&#160;V, capable of directly driving numerous commercial electronics, including electronic ink screen, metal electrodeposition setup, and light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode arrays. Such prominent performance is mainly attributed to the enhanced moisture&#8208;liberated proton diffusion proved by experimental observation and theoretical analysis. The ionic hydrogel with high cost&#8208;efficiency, easy&#8208;to&#8208;scaleup fabrication, and high power&#8208;output opens a brand&#8208;new perspective to develop a green, versatile, and efficient power source for Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and wearable electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Ionic hydrogel moisture electric generator (IHMEG) shows high power-output and stable voltage by virtue of synergistic effect of enhanced moisture-enabled protons diffusion and long-maintained water gradient. With easy-to-scaleup fabrication, high cost-efficiency, and wide adaptability to temperature and humidity, the IHMEG device holds great potentials to develop a green, efficient, flexible, and versatile direct-current power source for Internet-of-Things and wearable electronics.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Buried Additive for Cross&#8208;Layer Modification in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 22%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up infiltration method using HCOONH4 as pre&#8208;buried additive in SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) enables a cross&#8208;layer defect manipulation throughout the SnO2 ETL, perovskite layer, and their interface, along with a significantly reduced residual stress within perovskite film. As a result of the cross&#8208;layer treatment, a record power conversion efficiency of 22.37% (21.90% certified) is achieved on the optimized flexible perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown superior potentials in flexible photovoltaics due to their soft and high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight nature. However, interfacial residual stress and lattice mismatch due to the large deformation of flexible substrates have greatly limited the performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). Here, ammonium formate (HCOONH4) is used as a pre&#8208;buried additive in electron transport layer (ETL) to realize a bottom&#8208;up infiltration process for an in situ, integral modification of ETL, perovskite layer, and their interface. The HCOONH4 treatment leads to an enhanced electron extraction in ETL, relaxed residual strain and micro&#8208;strain in perovskite film, along with reduced defect densities within these layers. As a result, a top power conversion efficiency of 22.37% and a certified 21.9% on F&#8208;PSCs are achieved, representing the highest performance reported so far. This work links the critical connection between multilayer mechanics/defect profiles of ETL&#8208;perovskite structure and device performance, thus providing meaningful scientific direction to further narrowing the efficiency gap between F&#8208;PSCs and rigid&#8208;substrate counterparts.

         <title>Bioinspired Colloidal Photonic Composites: Fabrications and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal photonic composites bioinspired by organic organisms combine ordered photonic structures and functional polymeric matrices, which show both structural color of photonic crystals and functionality and responsiveness of the polymeric matrix. Colloidal photonic composites exhibit a variety of promising applications, from colorful coatings to visual sensors, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence.








Abstract
Organisms in nature have evolved unique structural colors and stimuli&#8208;responsive functions for camouflage, warning, and communication over millions of years, which are essential to their survival in harsh conditions. Inspired by these characteristics, colloidal photonic composites (CPCs) composed of colloidal photonic crystals embedded in the polymeric matrix are artificially prepared and show great promise in applications. This review focuses on the summary of building blocks, i.e., colloidal particles and polymeric matrices, and constructive strategies from the perspective of designing CPCs with robust performance and specific functionality. Furthermore, their state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications are also discussed, including colorful coatings, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence, especially in the field of visualized sensing. Finally, current challenges and potential for future developments in this field are discussed. The purpose of this review is not only to clarify the design principle for artificial CPCs but also to serve as a roadmap for the exploration of next&#8208;generation photonic materials.

         <title>Boosting Electrochemical Styrene Transformation via Tandem Water Oxidation over Single&#8208;Atom Cr1/CoSe2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organics using water as the oxygen source is a prospective but challenging method to produce high value&#8208;added chemicals, especially the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its efficiency. Herein, we present a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single&#8208;atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at CoSe2 support (Cr1/CoSe2). Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under the potential of 1.6 VAg/AgCl, it achieves excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent. Isotopic tracing, isotope&#8208;labeled in&#8208;situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from Co to Cr sites serves as the bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co&#8208;oxidation of multi&#8208;species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Simultaneous electrochemical exfoliation and covalent functionalization of MoS2 membrane for ion sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) membranes exhibit good anti&#8208;swelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, we report a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication, which was accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium ion intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 was optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets was improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes were tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;&#160;90% and &gt;&#160;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes were attributed to the suitable channel widths that were tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions were also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the MoS2&#8208;amide layers while a double layer between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

Abstract
Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off forming a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, the in&#8208;service formed defects will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, we present a dynamic healing interface (DHI) by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts a PCE to 12.05% for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for CsPbI2Br cell as well as 23.37% for FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Healing charge-selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state-of-the-art strategies are often static by one-off forming a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, the in-service formed defects will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, we present a dynamic healing interface (DHI) by incorporating a low-melting-point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non-radiative recombination, the DHI boosts a PCE to 12.05% for all-inorganic CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solar cell and 14.14% for CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br cell as well as 23.37% for FA&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid-to-liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries and suppress ion migration.

Abstract
Electroreduction transformation of small molecules (CO2, N2 and H2O) into chemical feedstocks offers a promising approach to eliminate carbon emissions and harness renewable energy. Most cathodic catalysts often undergo structural transformation under operating electroreduction condition. These structural reconstructions are reflected in the changes of their catalytic activity. In&#8208;depth understanding of the change of active sites and influence parameters of reconstructed behaviors are an essential precondition for the design of highly efficient catalysts. Despite the previous achievements, a comprehensive insight of the structural evolution mechanism in cathodic catalysts compared to anode ones under the reaction conditions are still lacking. Herein, we provide an overview of structural reconstruction for cathodic catalysts in terms of fundamental mechanisms, reconstruction process, advanced characterizations, and influence parameters. On this basis, the typical strategies for manipulating the structural reconfiguration of catalysts are also explicitly discussed from the catalyst structure and working environment. By delivering the mechanism, strategies, insights, and techniques, this review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural reconstruction of cathodic catalysts in electroreduction reaction and future guidelines for their rational development.
